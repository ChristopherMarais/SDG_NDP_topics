      "Amid observance of the birth centenary of the Greatest Bangali of all times, Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Golden Jubilee of our independence, I am extremely delighted to present our Government’s third successive Five Year Plan (July 2020- June 2025) to the people of Bangladesh since 2009. This flagship document contains the philosophy of realizing the ‘Golden Bengal’ as dreamed of by the Father of the Nation. We inherited a very fragile economy when we formed government following a landslide victory in the general election of 2008. By then there was stagnation in the backbone sectors such as energy and power, communication, and foreign exchange reserve including other socio- economic indicators. Awami League Government was able to restore the momentum of that sluggish economy back on track adopting a well-planned path of growth very quickly. Even in less than a decade, our GDP growth surpassed 8.0 percent. But in the last fiscal year 2019-20, the GDP growth rate was recorded 5.2 percent which was attributed to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With proper execution of well-planned strategies, schemes, and policies we have set targets to achieve GDP growth at 8.51 percent in the last fiscal year of the Eighth FYP. In FY 2008-09, the country’s GDP USD 89 billion, which was then expanded more than three times amounting to USD 302 billion in FY 2018-2019. Our foreign exchange reserve exceeded USD 43 billion. The poverty rate declined to 20.5 percent from 40.0 percent in 2005. Women in Bangladesh are now more empowered than at any time before. Now we are considering the villages as the Central Hub of our development philosophy. Therefore, Bangladesh has now been recognized as a ‘Role Model for Development’ by the world from the disgraceful remark, ‘Bottomless Basket’ in the past. In the field of infrastructure development, the multi-purpose Padma Bridge is the pride of Bangladeshi people. Despite the withdrawal of committed funding by a development partner, this largest bridge of Bangladesh currently under construction by the national finance will connect southwestern parts of Bangladesh to the rest of the country. Construction of metro rail and elevated expressway in the capital with a view to ease the traffic congestion is moving faster. To put the impetus on export trade construction of two deep-sea ports at Payra and Matarbari is approaching towards completion at a faster pace. Considering the future power demand of an economy that is aspiring to become an upper-middle-income country by 2031 and a status of a high-income country by 2041 building of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is underway. Moreover, we have also prepared the ‘Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100’ to offset the negative externalities of climate change and natural calamities. The objectives of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 will also be realized through the medium-term plans.\n",

      "It is indeed a great pleasure for me to present the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) of Bangladesh which has been prepared by the General Economics Division (GED) of Bangladesh Planning Commission as the first in the series of 04 Five Year Plans to complete the agenda of achieving the social and economic transformation visualized in the second “Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021-2041’. Eighth Five Year Plan would also be instrumental in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), realizing Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP)-2100 for smooth transition following the LDC graduation. We have adopted this plan at a very auspicious moment as the nation is observing the centennial birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation and celebration of the golden jubilee of our independence. Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025), which has been approved by the National Economic Council (NEC) on 29 December, 2020 will help to execute the political, social and economic agenda of the present government led by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The plan has emphasised on appropriate policies and institutions, and devised suitable development strategies for promoting prosperity, fostering inclusiveness, reducing poverty, and inequality. The lessons from the implementation of the Sixth and the Seventh Five Year Plans as instruments for implementing the First Perspective Plan 2021 including the adjustment to the Covid-19 fall out have duly been considered while formulating the Eighth Five Year Plan. Eighth Five Year Plan mainly centres on six core themes, which included: i) rapid recovery from COVID-19 ii) GDP growth acceleration, employment generation, and rapid poverty reduction with a broad-based strategy of inclusiveness iii) a sustainable development pathway resilient to disaster and climate change iv) sustainable use of natural resources and successful management of the inevitable urbanization transition v) development and improvement of critical institutions, and vi) attaining SDG targets and coping up the impact of LDC graduation. Effective implementation of the plan will mostly rely on the actions taken by the respective Ministries/Divisions and stakeholders from both public and private sectors. I would, therefore, call upon all concerned to put their attention and devotion for realizing the goals and targets of the Eighth Five Year Plan so that we can meet our development aspirations and establish a prosperous country within the stipulated timeframe. \n",

      "Eighth Five Year Plan is the culmination of a huge process that GED has followed with policy makers, ministries and divisions, various private sector bodies, development partners, economists, social scientists, researchers, academia, civil society members, etc. I thank the GED officials for their hard work and efforts which has made this possible even in unprecedented global pandemic COVID-19 situation. I would like to put on record with appreciation the contribution made by the members of the Panel of Economists in formulating this plan. In fine, I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for providing strategic guidance and inspiration to prepare the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) of Bangladesh.\n",

      "Foreword\n",
      "At the advent of the fifty years’ celebration of our great independence and the joyous Mujib birth centenary, the General Economics Division (GED) of Bangladesh Planning Commission has made colossal efforts to put forward the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) before the nation. As a constitutional mandate to attain a just and egalitarian society through planned economic growth, the first Five Year Plan was formulated under the prudent guidance and visionary leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which laid strong foundation of today’s development. Thereafter, a total of seven Five Year Plans were devised till date to map out the strategic vision to be a prosperous nation.Preparatory process of the Eighth Five Year Plan is marked by the infestation of major global catastrophe ‘COVID-19’, which has caused consequential economic conundrum across the world. The Eighth Five Year Plan is unique compared to its preceding two plans as it blends the COVID-19 recovery strategies in the macroeconomic framework as well as developing sectoral strategies in the plan. The government was in strong favour of the continuation of the Five Year Plan instead of formulating a separate COVID-19 response plan as discontinuation of the Five Year Plan could slow down the ongoing development initiatives of the government, which are extremely essential to face the challenges of LDC graduation, to meet the targets of SDGs and to fulfill the aspiration of the Vision 2041. Besides, the implementation of the Perspective Plan (PP) 2021-2041 is envisaged in four ‘Five Year Plans’; the first quinquennium starts with the Eighth Five Year Plan. Hence, the main objective of the Eighth Five Year Plan is to start the implementation of PP2021-2041 in a way that it brings Bangladesh closer to the goals of achieving UMIC status by 2031 and attaining SDGs targets through managing the challenges of LDC graduation, which will also help to eliminate extreme poverty by 2031.  Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the performance of the Seventh Five Year Plan in terms of achieving major development targets relating to economic growth, socio-economic transformation and poverty reduction was highly impressive. GDP growth accelerated and the average GDP growth during the Seventh Plan (7.13 per cent) nearly reached the annual average target of the Plan (7.4 per cent).  Remarkable progress has been noticed in transforming the economy from an agrarian economy towards a more modern urban-based manufacturing and services-based economy. The export-led manufacturing sector reached new heights, growing at an average pace of 12.7 per cent per year, supported by the greater role of modern service sector activities in areas of transport, banking, real estate, ICT, healthcare and education. A major objective of the Seventh Five Year Plan was to narrow the rural-urban divide by diversifying the economic activity base and the government has been very much successful in this regard through expansion of non-\n",
      "farm rural enterprises and services. Bangladesh also continued to push ahead with human development, women empowerment and social inclusion as key elements in realizing the dream of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for achieving a just society with no discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, race or caste. It is worth mentioning that the 2020 Global Gender Gap Report records the solid progress made by Bangladesh in reducing the gender gap.  Bangladesh was ranked 50th among 153 countries, even ahead of many advanced countries. Bangladesh has also continued its efforts in managing its environment in a sustainable way, which focused on reduction in air and water pollution, increasing forest coverage and improving preservation of biodiversity. The push toward achieving water safety and reducing long-term risk from climate change and natural disaster gained momentum through the adoption of a techno-economic Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP2100) covering the whole twenty-first century. The Eighth Plan has accorded top priority to move with proper implementation of the BDP2100. The preparation of Eighth Five Year Plan was commissioned in 2019. Initially, a ‘National Steering Committee’ was formed under the chairmanship of the Honorable Minister of Planning to oversight the preparation of the plan. A ‘Panel of Economists’, under the chairmanship of Dr. Wahiduddin Mahmud, has also been formed comprising luminous Bangladeshi economists, sociologists, educationalists and experts on relevant fields, who gave continuous support in shaping the Eighth Five Year Plan. In this noble initiative, GED has ensured partnership of all the government ministries/divisions/agencies, policy makers, academia, civil society organizations, NGOs, development partners, think-tanks and thought leaders in formulating this plan. A total of twenty five background studies have also been conducted with the help of the eminent experts in their respective fields. Most importantly, the concerned ministries/divisions have provided inputs with updated data that were reflected in the Eighth Five Year Plan. The Eighth Five Year Plan centers around six core themes, which are (i) rapid recovery from COVID-19; (ii) GDP growth acceleration, employment generation and rapid poverty reduction; (iii) a broad-based strategy of inclusiveness; (iv) a sustainable development pathway that is resilient to disaster and climate change; (v) improvement of critical institutions necessary to lead the economy to Upper Middle Income Country status by 2031; and (vi) attaining SDGs targets and mitigating the impact of LDC graduation. The plan document has been organized around two broad parts. The first part delineates the macroeconomic framework for the plan period (July 2020-June 2025) along with strategic directions and policy framework for promoting inclusiveness, reducing poverty and inequality. It also describes the resource envelop and overall fiscal management tools of the government and specifies the Development Results Framework (DRF) for proper monitoring and evaluation. The second part sets out the sectoral strategies for thirteen sectors (except defense) with some specific targets to attain by FY 2025. The ministries/divisions are expected to follow these sectoral strategies and action measures while preparing their sector specific projects and programs to achieve their respective targets set in the Eighth Five Year Plan. The Eighth Plan sets to hit the target of 8.51 per cent GDP growth by FY 2025. To accommodate this growth target, the gross investment needs to be raised to 36.59 per cent of GDP by FY 2025 in which private investment will capture the lion’s share (27.35 per cent of GDP). The service and manufacturing growths will be the major drivers of GDP growth in this journey. During the Eighth Plan period, the government will also strengthen its initiatives to ensure inclusive growth that will bring down the incidence of poverty to 15.6 per cent and extreme poverty to 7.4 per cent. The proper implementation of any plan needs efficient monitoring and evaluation. The Eighth Five Year Plan adopts a better informed DRF, drawing on the good experiences of the Sixth and Seventh Plans.  Both core macro and sectoral quantitative results will be monitored, with the help of 104 DRF indicators (more than half of which are related to SDGs), to measure \n",
      "the effective implementation of the Eighth Plan. A mid-term review of implementation progress is planned at the end of FY 2023, while a final implementation review will be done at the end of FY 2025, i.e. after the completion of the plan.I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Honorable Prime Minister and the Chairman of National Economic Council for her strategic guidance and well-judged suggestions for finalising the Eighth Plan so that it becomes useful to uplift the well-being of the citizens of Bangladesh. We are also very much thankful to the Honorable Minister of Planning for leading the preparation of the Eighth Five Year Plan. The ministries/divisions and other stakeholders also owe us a debt of gratitude who were deeply involved in providing important and useful inputs for the plan document. The officials of GED (especially PAM Wing), despite COVID-19 outbreak, have put outstanding and tireless effort from drafting part to finalising the Eighth Five Year Plan for which they deserve endless plaudits. Finally, I highly appreciate the contribution of the experts of the ‘Panel of Economists’ including the civil society participants who have given intimate support in finalising the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025).\n",
