Bangla version of the Eighth Five Year Plan is in the process of publication.Cover Design & Text Layout byDr. Shamsul AlamMember (Senior Secretary), GEDPrinted byturtle67/d (3rd Floor) Green Road Panthapath | Dhaka-1205turtlebd.comDecember 2020Copies Published: 500 (First Edition) “No plan, however well-formulated, can be implemented unless there is a total Commitment on the part of the people of the country to work hard and make necessary sacrifices. All of us will, therefore, have to dedicate ourselves to the task of nation building with single-minded determination. I am confident that our people will devote themselves to this task with as much courage and vigour as they demonstrated during the war of liberation. The above is an extract, in abridged form, taken from the Foreword of the First Five Year Plan of Bangladesh which was prepared under the guidance and leadership of the \\nFATHER OF THE NATION, BANGABANDHU SHEIKH MUJIBUR RAHMAN.”\\n  Message\\nAmid observance of the birth centenary of the Greatest Bangali of all times, Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Golden Jubilee of our independence, I am extremely delighted to present our Government’s third successive Five Year Plan (July 2020- June 2025) to the people of Bangladesh since 2009. This flagship document contains the philosophy of realizing the ‘Golden Bengal’ as dreamed of by the Father of the Nation. We inherited a very fragile economy when we formed government following a landslide victory in the general election of 2008. By then there was stagnation in the backbone sectors such as energy and power, communication, and foreign exchange reserve including other socio- economic indicators. Awami League Government was able to restore the momentum of that sluggish economy back on track adopting a well-planned path of growth very quickly. Even in less than a decade, our GDP growth surpassed 8.0 percent. But in the last fiscal year 2019-20, the GDP growth rate was recorded 5.2 percent which was attributed to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With proper execution of well-planned strategies, schemes, and policies we have set targets to achieve GDP growth at 8.51 percent in the last fiscal year of the Eighth FYP. In FY 2008-09, the country’s GDP USD 89 billion, which was then expanded more than three times amounting to USD 302 billion in FY 2018-2019. Our foreign exchange reserve exceeded USD 43 billion. The poverty rate declined to 20.5 percent from 40.0 percent in 2005. Women in Bangladesh are now more empowered than at any time before. Now we are considering the villages as the Central Hub of our development philosophy. Therefore, Bangladesh has now been recognized as a ‘Role Model for Development’ by the world from the disgraceful remark, ‘Bottomless Basket’ in the past. In the field of infrastructure development, the multi-purpose Padma Bridge is the pride of Bangladeshi people. Despite the withdrawal of committed funding by a development partner, this largest bridge of Bangladesh currently under construction by the national finance will connect southwestern parts of Bangladesh to the rest of the country. Construction of metro rail and elevated expressway in the capital with a view to ease the traffic congestion is moving faster. To put the impetus on export trade construction of two deep-sea ports at Payra and Matarbari is approaching towards completion at a faster pace. Considering the future power demand of an economy that is aspiring to become an upper-middle-income country by 2031 and a status of a high-income country by 2041 building of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is underway. Moreover, we have also prepared the ‘Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100’ to offset the negative externalities of climate change and natural calamities. The objectives of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 will also be realized through the medium-term plans.\\n The extreme onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic is still continuing in the world. However, we are trotting up keeping this deadly virus at the bay due to our Government’s pragmatic interventions. Presently, our economy is functioning satisfactorily. Keeping all impediments of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind, we have prepared the Eighth Five Year Plan. Following the objectives- recovery from COVID 19, preparing Bangladesh for LDC graduation, achieving SDGs, and setting a trajectory towards a prosperous country by 2041, special importance has been given while preparing this instrument. We expect to achieve an 8.0 percent average growth rate during the plan period, reduce the poverty rate from 20.50 percent to 15.60 percent, and further strengthen the existing social security system while eliminating poverty and narrowing inequality. I thank the General Economics Division (GED) of the Bangladesh Planning Commission led by its Member (Senior Secretary) for their sincere and hard work relating to formulating the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025). I hope all concerned public, private, NGOs, CSOs, think tanks, and entrepreneurs- will join together in materializing the goals and targets of the Eighth Plan. I also believe that our venture towards building a self-reliant, happy, and prosperous Bangladesh will be successful indeed. With these achievements, we will be able to offer due respect and sincere tribute to our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Joy Bangla, Joy BangabandhuMay Bangladesh Live Forever\\nSheikh Hasina\\nHon’ble Prime MinisterGovernment of the People’s Republic of BangladeshandChairperson, Bangladesh Planning Commission M. A. Mannan, MP\\nMinisterMinistry of PlanningGovernment of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh &Vice-Chairman, Bangladesh Planning Commission\\nMessage\\nIt is indeed a great pleasure for me to present the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) of Bangladesh which has been prepared by the General Economics Division (GED) of Bangladesh Planning Commission as the first in the series of 04 Five Year Plans to complete the agenda of achieving the social and economic transformation visualized in the second “Perspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021-2041’. Eighth Five Year Plan would also be instrumental in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), realizing Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP)-2100 for smooth transition following the LDC graduation. We have adopted this plan at a very auspicious moment as the nation is observing the centennial birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation and celebration of the golden jubilee of our independence. Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025), which has been approved by the National Economic Council (NEC) on 29 December, 2020 will help to execute the political, social and economic agenda of the present government led by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The plan has emphasised on appropriate policies and institutions, and devised suitable development strategies for promoting prosperity, fostering inclusiveness, reducing poverty, and inequality. The lessons from the implementation of the Sixth and the Seventh Five Year Plans as instruments for implementing the First Perspective Plan 2021 including the adjustment to the Covid-19 fall out have duly been considered while formulating the Eighth Five Year Plan. Eighth Five Year Plan mainly centres on six core themes, which included: i) rapid recovery from COVID-19 ii) GDP growth acceleration, employment generation, and rapid poverty reduction with a broad-based strategy of inclusiveness iii) a sustainable development pathway resilient to disaster and climate change iv) sustainable use of natural resources and successful management of the inevitable urbanization transition v) development and improvement of critical institutions, and vi) attaining SDG targets and coping up the impact of LDC graduation. Effective implementation of the plan will mostly rely on the actions taken by the respective Ministries/Divisions and stakeholders from both public and private sectors. I would, therefore, call upon all concerned to put their attention and devotion for realizing the goals and targets of the Eighth Five Year Plan so that we can meet our development aspirations and establish a prosperous country within the stipulated timeframe. \\n Eighth Five Year Plan is the culmination of a huge process that GED has followed with policy makers, ministries and divisions, various private sector bodies, development partners, economists, social scientists, researchers, academia, civil society members, etc. I thank the GED officials for their hard work and efforts which has made this possible even in unprecedented global pandemic COVID-19 situation. I would like to put on record with appreciation the contribution made by the members of the Panel of Economists in formulating this plan. In fine, I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for providing strategic guidance and inspiration to prepare the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) of Bangladesh.\\n(M. A. Mannan, MP) Dr. Shamsul Alam\\nMember (Senior Secretary)General Economics Division (GED)Bangladesh Planning Commission\\nForeword\\nAt the advent of the fifty years’ celebration of our great independence and the joyous Mujib birth centenary, the General Economics Division (GED) of Bangladesh Planning Commission has made colossal efforts to put forward the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025) before the nation. As a constitutional mandate to attain a just and egalitarian society through planned economic growth, the first Five Year Plan was formulated under the prudent guidance and visionary leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which laid strong foundation of today’s development. Thereafter, a total of seven Five Year Plans were devised till date to map out the strategic vision to be a prosperous nation.Preparatory process of the Eighth Five Year Plan is marked by the infestation of major global catastrophe ‘COVID-19’, which has caused consequential economic conundrum across the world. The Eighth Five Year Plan is unique compared to its preceding two plans as it blends the COVID-19 recovery strategies in the macroeconomic framework as well as developing sectoral strategies in the plan. The government was in strong favour of the continuation of the Five Year Plan instead of formulating a separate COVID-19 response plan as discontinuation of the Five Year Plan could slow down the ongoing development initiatives of the government, which are extremely essential to face the challenges of LDC graduation, to meet the targets of SDGs and to fulfill the aspiration of the Vision 2041. Besides, the implementation of the Perspective Plan (PP) 2021-2041 is envisaged in four ‘Five Year Plans’; the first quinquennium starts with the Eighth Five Year Plan. Hence, the main objective of the Eighth Five Year Plan is to start the implementation of PP2021-2041 in a way that it brings Bangladesh closer to the goals of achieving UMIC status by 2031 and attaining SDGs targets through managing the challenges of LDC graduation, which will also help to eliminate extreme poverty by 2031.  Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the performance of the Seventh Five Year Plan in terms of achieving major development targets relating to economic growth, socio-economic transformation and poverty reduction was highly impressive. GDP growth accelerated and the average GDP growth during the Seventh Plan (7.13 per cent) nearly reached the annual average target of the Plan (7.4 per cent).  Remarkable progress has been noticed in transforming the economy from an agrarian economy towards a more modern urban-based manufacturing and services-based economy. The export-led manufacturing sector reached new heights, growing at an average pace of 12.7 per cent per year, supported by the greater role of modern service sector activities in areas of transport, banking, real estate, ICT, healthcare and education. A major objective of the Seventh Five Year Plan was to narrow the rural-urban divide by diversifying the economic activity base and the government has been very much successful in this regard through expansion of non- farm rural enterprises and services. Bangladesh also continued to push ahead with human development, women empowerment and social inclusion as key elements in realizing the dream of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for achieving a just society with no discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, race or caste. It is worth mentioning that the 2020 Global Gender Gap Report records the solid progress made by Bangladesh in reducing the gender gap.  Bangladesh was ranked 50th among 153 countries, even ahead of many advanced countries. Bangladesh has also continued its efforts in managing its environment in a sustainable way, which focused on reduction in air and water pollution, increasing forest coverage and improving preservation of biodiversity. The push toward achieving water safety and reducing long-term risk from climate change and natural disaster gained momentum through the adoption of a techno-economic Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP2100) covering the whole twenty-first century. The Eighth Plan has accorded top priority to move with proper implementation of the BDP2100. The preparation of Eighth Five Year Plan was commissioned in 2019. Initially, a ‘National Steering Committee’ was formed under the chairmanship of the Honorable Minister of Planning to oversight the preparation of the plan. A ‘Panel of Economists’, under the chairmanship of Dr. Wahiduddin Mahmud, has also been formed comprising luminous Bangladeshi economists, sociologists, educationalists and experts on relevant fields, who gave continuous support in shaping the Eighth Five Year Plan. In this noble initiative, GED has ensured partnership of all the government ministries/divisions/agencies, policy makers, academia, civil society organizations, NGOs, development partners, think-tanks and thought leaders in formulating this plan. A total of twenty five background studies have also been conducted with the help of the eminent experts in their respective fields. Most importantly, the concerned ministries/divisions have provided inputs with updated data that were reflected in the Eighth Five Year Plan. The Eighth Five Year Plan centers around six core themes, which are (i) rapid recovery from COVID-19; (ii) GDP growth acceleration, employment generation and rapid poverty reduction; (iii) a broad-based strategy of inclusiveness; (iv) a sustainable development pathway that is resilient to disaster and climate change; (v) improvement of critical institutions necessary to lead the economy to Upper Middle Income Country status by 2031; and (vi) attaining SDGs targets and mitigating the impact of LDC graduation. The plan document has been organized around two broad parts. The first part delineates the macroeconomic framework for the plan period (July 2020-June 2025) along with strategic directions and policy framework for promoting inclusiveness, reducing poverty and inequality. It also describes the resource envelop and overall fiscal management tools of the government and specifies the Development Results Framework (DRF) for proper monitoring and evaluation. The second part sets out the sectoral strategies for thirteen sectors (except defense) with some specific targets to attain by FY 2025. The ministries/divisions are expected to follow these sectoral strategies and action measures while preparing their sector specific projects and programs to achieve their respective targets set in the Eighth Five Year Plan. The Eighth Plan sets to hit the target of 8.51 per cent GDP growth by FY 2025. To accommodate this growth target, the gross investment needs to be raised to 36.59 per cent of GDP by FY 2025 in which private investment will capture the lion’s share (27.35 per cent of GDP). The service and manufacturing growths will be the major drivers of GDP growth in this journey. During the Eighth Plan period, the government will also strengthen its initiatives to ensure inclusive growth that will bring down the incidence of poverty to 15.6 per cent and extreme poverty to 7.4 per cent. The proper implementation of any plan needs efficient monitoring and evaluation. The Eighth Five Year Plan adopts a better informed DRF, drawing on the good experiences of the Sixth and Seventh Plans.  Both core macro and sectoral quantitative results will be monitored, with the help of 104 DRF indicators (more than half of which are related to SDGs), to measure  the effective implementation of the Eighth Plan. A mid-term review of implementation progress is planned at the end of FY 2023, while a final implementation review will be done at the end of FY 2025, i.e. after the completion of the plan.I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Honorable Prime Minister and the Chairman of National Economic Council for her strategic guidance and well-judged suggestions for finalising the Eighth Plan so that it becomes useful to uplift the well-being of the citizens of Bangladesh. We are also very much thankful to the Honorable Minister of Planning for leading the preparation of the Eighth Five Year Plan. The ministries/divisions and other stakeholders also owe us a debt of gratitude who were deeply involved in providing important and useful inputs for the plan document. The officials of GED (especially PAM Wing), despite COVID-19 outbreak, have put outstanding and tireless effort from drafting part to finalising the Eighth Five Year Plan for which they deserve endless plaudits. Finally, I highly appreciate the contribution of the experts of the ‘Panel of Economists’ including the civil society participants who have given intimate support in finalising the Eighth Five Year Plan (July 2020-June 2025).\\nDr. Shamsul Alam  i \\n Contents  \\n8th Five Year Plan   \\nContents  ................................ ................................ ................................

Political Context  \\nThe gove rnments led by the Awami League have always pursued a planned route for the socioeconomic \\ndevelopment of the country. The father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman soon after \\nassuming the power initiated massive programmes for rebuilding the w ar-torn economy in a planned \\nmanner. Under his visionary and prudent leadership, the First Five Year Plan (1973 -78) was formulated to \\nguide the transformation of the country into ‘Sonar Bangla’ , free of poverty, hunger and corruption along \\nwith rapid incom e growth and shared prosperity.  \\nThe Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina realized the importance of effective planning and as such \\nformulated a large number of long and medium -term plans, following the philosophy and path of \\ndevelopment shown by the fat her of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Returning to power \\nin 2009, she reiterated her solidarity with the people and commitment to fight poverty by announcing the \\nVision 2021 and the associated Perspective Plan 2021 (PP2021) that sought to ac hieve middle income status \\nby 2021, improve human development and sharply reduce poverty. Astute political leadership and deft \\neconomic management by the Honorable Prime Minister allowed Bangladesh to enjoy an uninterrupted 10 \\nyears of economic prosperity between FY2009 and FY2019. This period saw per capita income rise from \\nUSD 754 to USD 2064, life expectancy increased from 67 years to 73 years, adult literacy expanded from \\n58% to 75%, poverty incidence fell from 35% to 20.5% and extreme poverty rate decl ined from 18% to \\n10.5%.  Growing at an average pace of 7% per year during this period, Bangladesh is amongst the fastest \\ngrowing countries in the world. As a result, Bangladesh moved out from the World Bank -defined list of \\nlow-income countries (LIC) to Low er Middle -Income Country (LMIC) in 2015, much earlier than the \\ntargeted date of 2021, and in 2018, it met all the UN criteria to graduate from the list of Least Developed \\nCountries (LDC) to a developing country. Bangladesh is expected to formally graduate from LDC in 2024; \\nthis is certainly one of the remarkable achievements for Bangladesh in her post -independence era. \\nEncouraged by these successes, the people re -elected Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her \\nparty the Awami League with an overwhelm ing mandate for a third consecutive term on December 30, \\n2018.  She accepted this responsibility with a pledge to work even harder and to translate the dream of her \\nfather into reality. To achieve this, the government adopted the Vision 2041 and the associ ated Perspective \\nPlan 2041 (PP2041) that sets the road map to become an Upper Middle -Income Country (UMIC) and \\neliminate extreme poverty by FY2031, and to achieve a High -Income Country (HIC) status by FY2041. \\nThis 8th Five Year Plan is prepared at the time  when the whole nation is observing the centennial birth \\nanniversary of the father of the nation and will celebrate the golden jubilee of independence in 2021.  \\nB. Onslaught of the Unprecedented Global Pandemic COVID -19 \\nAs preparations were underway to develo p the Eighth Five Year Plan (8FYP) running from FY2021 -\\nFY2025, the unforeseen and unprecedented global pandemic COVID -19 struck Bangladesh and the rest of \\nworld from around March 2020. The furious and devastating nature of this fast -spreading pandemic has \\nshaken the entire world. Millions have been infected and hundreds of thousands have died around the world. \\nLockdown measures necessitated to slowdown the rate of growth of COVID -19 spread and the fall in \\ndemand have badly damaged the world economy.  Despit e pouring in trillions of dollars in relief and  xxxviii  \\n economic stimulus, the OECD countries slumped into recession even within the first 4 months of the \\npandemic, thereby illustrating the furious onslaught of the epidemic. Global efforts are underway to find \\nhealth solution to end the pandemic, but the end is not yet in sight.  \\nBangladesh has also been hit hard both on the human health front and on the economy.  Fortunately, the \\nlevel of known infections and deaths are modest in relation to many parts of the world  including the \\nneighboring India; yet the peak of the pandemic is still unknown. On the economic front, losses are \\nunprecedented. GDP growth has slowed considerably, export earnings are down sharply, private and public \\ninvestment rates have fallen and gove rnment fiscal revenues have been badly hurt. The Government has \\nmoved swiftly to contain the damage taking actions on both the human health front and on the economy. \\nOn the health front policy responses have sought to contain the spread of the virus throug h full and partial \\nlockdowns, providing safety gears and other support to protect the healthcare workers and other essential \\nstaff, strengthening healthcare facilities with supplies and equipment, undertaking testing, and educating \\nthe masses on the adopti on of health safety measures including physical distancing, use of face masks, hand \\nwashing and personal hygiene and other support measures. On the economic front, the government has \\nadopted a series economic stimulus packages estimated at Taka 1196.4 bill ion (4.3% of GDP) with a view \\nto protecting the income of the poor and vulnerable and helping the revival of economic activities.  \\nBangladesh has decided to open up the economy to avoid a sustained long -term damage to livelihoods.  The \\ngovernment believes t hat there is no necessary tradeoff between human health and health of the economy; \\nrather they are correlated and complementary. The main task is to develop a balanced mix of policies and \\nprogrammes that address both goals. The government believes that the  restoration of human health is of the \\nhighest priority to enable workers resume work without fear or unwarranted risk of falling sick.  The \\ngovernment is working closely with local epidemiologists and other health experts to find ways to keep \\nworkers and families safe while economic activities revive. The strategy is flexible and will adapt to the \\nlessons of international experience  and the results in Bangladesh.  \\nC. Implementation Performance of the 7FYP  \\nPrior to the advent of COVID -19, the performance of th e Seventh Plan in terms of achieving major \\ndevelopment targets relating to economic growth, economic transformation and poverty reduction was \\nhighly positive. GDP growth accelerated and grew faster than envisaged in the 7FYP.  Thus, the average \\nGDP growth in the first 4 years of the 7FYP (7.6%) exceeds the target in the Plan (7.4%). However, due to \\nCOVID -19, the actual average GDP growth rate stands at 7.13% covering the whole 7FYP period. During \\n2016 -2019, Bangladesh was amongst the fastest growing countri es in the World. Progress in transforming \\nthe economy from a rural -based agrarian economy towards a more modern urban -based manufacturing and \\nservices -based economy has been strong. The export -led manufacturing sector reached new heights, \\ngrowing at an ave rage pace of 12.7% per year. Along with strong growth in construction the GDP share of \\nindustry reached 34.6%. Services sector grew robustly at 6%, supported by an expanding role of modern \\nservice activities in transport, banking, real estate, ICT, healthc are and education.  \\nA major objective of the 7FYP was to narrow the rural -urban divide by diversifying the economic activity \\nbase in the rural areas. Evidence shows that considerable progress was made. Already during the Sixth Plan, \\nthe rural economy had b een transforming from a pre -dominantly agriculture - based production structure \\ntowards more non -farm -based production activities. The Seventh Plan further pushed this transformation.  xxxix  \\n Agriculture is no longer the pre -dominant source of income in the rural e conomy. Within agriculture there \\nhas a been a slow and steady transformation from cereals to protein -based production such as livestock, \\npoultry, dairy -products, fruits and vegetables and flowers. Export -oriented fisheries have taken up a big \\nrole as a sou rce of farm income in Bangladesh. Thus, the share of fisheries in agricultural value -added \\nexpanded from 23% in FY2015 to 26% in FY2019. This transformation further strengthened food security.  \\nGrain production is now adequate to meet the calorie intake re quirements of the population while the greater \\nsupply of protein -rich fish, poultry, eggs and milk along with expansion of vegetables and fruits has \\ncontributed to improving the food security and food nutrition balance for the population.  \\nThe expansion of non-farm rural enterprises and services has opened up new sources of rural income and \\nemployment. The growth of income from non -farm sources and the rapid inflow of foreign remittances \\nhave supported the increase in demand for a range of activities in cons truction, housing, trade, transport, \\nschooling, health and other services. The expansion of ICT network and related services along with growth \\nof rural electricity and rural roads have reduced the transaction costs between the rural and urban \\neconomies, th ereby facilitating better trade and higher prices for the products of the rural economy. The \\nprogress on rural transformation is very re -assuring and provides a strong base to move forward further in \\nthe Eighth Plan.   \\nRegarding job creation, agriculture c ontinued to transform from a pre -dominantly peasant production \\nsystem towards a more commercially -oriented production structure and thereby continued to shed labour.  \\nNew job creation in manufacturing, construction and organized services expanded by an ave rage of 3 -4% \\nper year, which is slower than projected in the 7FYP. But growth in new employment was better -than-\\nplanned in the overseas market. The good news on the employment front is the improvement in labour \\nproductivity. Thus, average national labour p roductivity grew by a healthy 5.6% per year. Importantly, \\naverage labour productivity increased in all sectors including agriculture, where it is estimated to have \\nincreased by a record 7.3% per year.  This is an important result and provides the basis for  sustained \\nincreases in real wages and income economy wide and in agriculture. Productivity grew fastest in \\nmanufacturing, rising at a hefty pace of 9% per year. Productivity improvements have helped increase real \\nwages in agriculture and manufacturing in both rural and urban areas that have been highly beneficial to \\nthe reduction of poverty.   \\nNevertheless, the slowdown in the rate of job creation in manufacturing, construction and modern services \\nneed stronger monitoring with corrective policy measures in  the 8FYP.  This is particularly important to \\naddress the COVID -19 induced unemployment. An additional challenge would be to lower the growing \\nunemployment of the youth population, especially the educated youth, during the 8FYP. Finally, the Fourth \\nIndustr ial Revolution is requiring rapid changes in skills that needs fast tracking of education quality and \\nskills upgrading program. These issues will be given high priority in the 8FYP.  \\nThe incidences of poverty and extreme poverty have both exhibited consider able reduction during the first \\n4 years of the 7FYP. The incidence of poverty fell to 20.5% in FY2019 while extreme poverty declined to \\naround 10.5%. This progress was achieved due to a number of factors. First, the rapid growth of the \\neconomy during the S eventh Plan along with structural change in production provided the basis for growth \\nin employment, labor productivity and real incomes of workers. This is the most important contributor to \\npoverty reduction. Second, the healthy flow of remittances to rura l areas supported the growth of \\nconsumption and created new jobs in services in rural areas. Third, the spread of micro credit programmes  xl \\n also helped protect the consumption of the rural poor and buildup of their assets. Fourth, under the Ashrayan \\nProject the government has provided housing facilities to the landless and homeless families. On the \\noccasion of Mujib centenary, the government has allocated Tk. 1,160 Crore in the first phase to provide \\n65,726 unit house s along with 2 decimal land to the landles s and homeless families. Another 128,000 houses \\nwill be built in the next one year. So far, 3,57,590 beneficiaries have been rehabilitated by constructing new \\nhouses/barracks with government funding. Houses will be constructed for 8,85,622 poor families  listed \\nfrom all districts of the country in phases.  \\n \\nAlong with poverty reduction, Bangladesh continued to push ahead with human development, women \\nempowerment and social inclusion as key elements for realizing Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh \\nMujibur  Rahman’s dream of a just society with no discrimination on the basis of gender, religion, race or \\ncaste. Life expectancy increased to 73 years in 2019, up from 71 years in 2015, adult literacy increased \\nfrom 65% in 2015 to 75% in 2019 and child nutrition outcomes improved with the incidence of stunting \\nand wasting falling considerably. On the gender front, having eliminated the gender disparity in primary \\nand secondary education, solid progress has been made in reducing the large gap between male and femal e \\nstudents at the tertiary level. Bangladesh has also advanced well in providing the regulatory framework for \\nprotection of women’s rights and privileges. Progress has been made in increasing the share of women in \\nmanagerial and professional leadership rol es. Political empowerment has been boosted further through \\nincreased membership in the national parliament. The 2020 Global Gender Gap Report published by World \\nEconomic Forum records the solid progress made by Bangladesh in reducing the gender gap. With a n \\noverall score of 0.726, Bangladesh was ranked at 50th among 153 countries, ahead of advanced countries \\nlike the USA, Luxembourg, Italy, Korea and Japan and was ranked first among the seven South Asian \\ncountries.    \\nThe progress in moving towards an equit able and just society during the 7FYP notwithstanding, there are \\ntwo areas where stronger efforts are needed. First, the women empowerment on the economic front needs \\nmore attention. At only 36%, the female labor force participation is very low and not com mensurate with \\nUMIC Bangladesh. Second, although all legal and regulatory policies are in place to eliminate all kinds of \\ngender discrimination and prevent violence against women, there are reports about continued violation of \\nthese laws including early ma rriages, spousal abuse, and wage and employment discrimination against \\nfemale employees in the work place. The 8FYP will make stronger efforts to enhance female labor \\nparticipation rate and implement all legal provisions to eliminate gender discrimination and violence against \\nwomen.  \\nBangladesh has continued the move forward with its environmental management focused on reduction in \\nair and water pollution, increasing forest cover and improving preservation of biodiversity. Adaptation \\nefforts to climate chang e have been supported by pilot programmes funded through the Bangladesh Climate \\nChange Trust Fund (BCCTF). The disaster management programmes have continued to perform well. The \\nability to sharply reduce the loss of lives and injuries based on a combinatio n of early warning system, \\nconstruction and availability of shelters and timely provision of relief and support measures are indicative \\nof the good progress here.   \\nThe push toward reducing long -term risk from climate change and natural disaster gained mom entum \\nthrough the adoption of a comprehensive long -term water management strategy known as the Bangladesh \\nDelta Plan (BDP2100) that integrates water, land, environment, climate change and biodiversity in ways  xli \\n that upon implementation will substantially red uce long -term risks from natural disasters and climate \\nchange. This may be a game changer in securing sustainable reductions in poverty linked to natural hazards. \\nThe 8FYP will give top priority to implementing the first phase of the BDP2100.  \\nPrudent macro economic management has been the hallmark of Bangladesh’s long -term development. The \\n7FYP kept its vigil to stay on track despite some pressures. The inflation rate has come down further to \\n5.5%. Interest rates are low and the flow of credit to the private  sector is adequate. Fiscal prudence has been \\nsustained by keeping the budget deficit at around 5% of GDP. The balance of payments has been \\ncomfortable, with low external debt to GDP ratio and no pressure on external debt servicing. Two areas of \\ndifficulty  are the shortfalls on budget revenues and the stress on the health of the banking sector owing to \\nthe surge in non -performing loans (NPLs). At below 9%, the tax to GDP ratio is one of the lowest in the \\nworld and growing revenue shortages are making it inc reasingly difficult to finance critical public \\nexpenditure needs in infrastructure, health, education, water resources and social protection. In the banking \\nsector the large value of non -performing loan in both public and private banks, but especially the public \\nbanks, are putting pressure on the financial health of the affected banks and preventing sustainable approach \\nto mobilizing deposits while also reducing interest rates on loans. Tax reforms and banking reforms will \\nbecome even more important as the nation faces to fight the COVID -19 adverse economic effects.  \\nD. Implications of COVID -19 for the 8FYP  \\nThe macroeconomic effects of COVID -19 are still unfolding as the pandemic continues to take its toll on \\nhuman lives, health and wellbeing. Based on availabl e evidence, the main macroeconomic effects for \\nFY2020 outcomes are summarized in Table 1.13, Chapter 1, Part 1 of the Plan document. The effects are \\nsevere with substantial losses  in GDP (Taka 800 billion), exports ($8 billion), investment (Taka 500 billio n) \\nand tax revenues (Taka 200 billion).  Additionally, in the short -term unemployment and poverty may likely \\nto rise. The government has taken measures to offset this short -term increase in poverty.  However, the full \\nimpact to stem the tide of the downtur n in the domestic economy will take time to unfold, until such time \\nthat the health effects of COVID -19 become manageable, workers return to the work place, and people \\nresume their normal activities so that the demand for service like transport, hotels and  restaurants, vacation, \\ntourism, beauty care, education, personal services all return to normal levels. Importantly, the recovery of \\nearnings from exports and remittances will depend upon how quickly the global economy gets back to \\nnormal. The recovery of both domestic activity and global economy is predicated upon the discovery of \\ncure or vaccine for COVID -19. The best expectations today are that global recovery could happen in early \\n2021 calendar year.   \\n \\nThe COVID -19 reinforces the importance of speeding  up many of the reforms where a performance gap \\nhas emerged. This includes revenue performance, private investment climate, export diversification and \\ndomestic job creation. The tax performance of Bangladesh has been slipping and this must be reversed \\nquickly with important tax reforms under the 8FYP.   Similarly, export diversification and expansion of a \\ndiversified manufacturing base are of utmost importance. This will not be possible without substantial \\nincreases in domestic and foreign private investmen t. The 8FYP will focus utmost attention to improving \\nthe investment climate for domestic and foreign private investment with a view to offsetting the lack -lustre \\nprivate sector investment performance in the 7FYP. Finally, the short -term unemployment result ing from \\nCOVID -19 including retrenchment of overseas workers will present an immense challenge in the very first \\nyear of the 8FYP.  Job creation accordingly will be a top priority of the 8FYP.   xlii \\n The COVID -19 effects also bring in new challenges. In addition  to the short -term recovery, strategic \\nchanges will be needed in several areas relating to healthcare, social protection and access to safe water and \\nsanitation. The health and social protection systems came under pressure during COVID -19 and showed \\nmajor gaps that will be addressed in the 8FYP. The 8FYP will need to initiate a major overhaul of the \\nhealthcare system to strengthen physical facilities, access to healthcare and availability of quality healthcare \\nstaff. The COVID -19 has also reinforced the nee d for a universal healthcare system.  Regarding the social \\nsecurity system, the implementation of the NSSS will have to be strengthened with greater funding for \\nsocial protection -related income transfers to the poor and vulnerable. The COVID -19 also reinfo rces the \\nimportance of access to safe water and sanitation as important instruments for improving health and \\nreducing the spread of COVID infection.   \\nIn addition to the above immediate priority reforms, there are four areas where the Eighth Plan will prob e \\ndeeper and take a more focused and comprehensive approach as envisaged in PP2041.  The first concerns \\nthe need to build stronger institutions. Emphasis will be placed on institutions like the local government, \\nthe urban institutions, land administration,  strengthening of the National Board of Revenue, the Bangladesh \\nBank, and the Public -Private Partnership. The strengthening of the judiciary, the Election Commission and \\nother democratic institutions will continue Secondly, implementation capacity in publi c agencies and \\nministries will be upgraded to ensure timely implementation of major public investment programmes and \\npublic policies in transport and social sectors. Thirdly, stronger policy focus will be given to the area of \\nincome inequality. In particul ar, reform of public finances that increases the equity of tax collection and \\npublic spending are of substantial importance. Especially, the equity aspects of public spending on \\neducation and health will be emphasized. Finally, strong implementation of the  Bangladesh Delta Plan for \\nensuring the sound management of water resources, climate change, natural disasters and other \\nenvironmental hazards will be a major focus for the Eighth Plan. The integration of climate change and \\nenvironmental management issues in growth and fiscal policy management will be another high priority \\nissue for the Eighth Plan.  \\nE. Development Approach of the 8FYP  \\nThe implementation of PP2041 is envisaged in four 5 -year phases. The first phase starts with the 8FYP.  \\nSo, the main task of t he 8FYP is to start the implementation of PP2041 in a way that it brings Bangladesh \\ncloser to the goals of attaining UMIC status, attaining major SDG targets, and eliminating extreme poverty \\nby FY2031. In the backdrop of these factors, the 8th Plan centres  on six core themes:  \\n\\uf0b7 Rapid recovery for COVID -19 to restore human health, confidence, employment, income and \\neconomic activities;  \\n\\uf0b7 GDP growth acceleration, employment generation, productivity acceleration and rapid poverty \\nreduction;  \\n\\uf0b7 A broad -based strateg y of inclusiveness with a view to empowering every citizen to participate \\nfully and benefit from the development process and helping the poor and vulnerable with social \\nprotection - based income transfers;  \\n\\uf0b7 A sustainable development pathway that is resilien t to disaster and climate change; entails \\nsustainable use of natural resources; and successfully manages the inevitable urbanization transition;  \\n\\uf0b7 Development and improvement of critical institutions necessary to lead the economy to UMIC status;  \\n\\uf0b7 Attaining S DG targets and coping up the impact of LDC graduation.   xliii \\n F. Strategy for COVID -19 Recovery  \\n \\nThe government has demonstrated its resolve to address the challenges emerging from COVID -19 swiftly \\nand comprehensively with a view to minimizing the loss of lives, re storing the health of those affected, \\nremoving fear and building confidence, and putting the economy on a path of economic recovery while \\ntaking care this is consistent with the restoration of human  health and confidence. In addition to \\nimplementing the ac tions already taken in FY20 20, the government will take a number of far -reaching steps \\nto improve health care capabilities and facilities in the 8FYP.  Funding for healthcare will be increased, \\npublic -private cooperation will be strengthened, the capabilit ies of district -level healthcare facilities will be \\nenhanced, and a Universal Health Care funded through a combination of private and public health insurance \\nschemes will be introduced.   The social protection programmes will be strengthened to provide hig her \\nincome transfers to the poor and vulnerable. Access of the rural and urban population to safe water and \\nsanitation will be enhanced.  The economic activity opening up will be phased and implemented in ways \\nthat risks to COVID spread are minimized. Bang ladesh will learn from the lessons of other country \\nexperience in fine tuning its health response to COVID -19. It will also liaise with the World Health \\nOrganization and countries that are well advanced in medical search for COVID -19 vaccine and or cure. \\nAll efforts will be made to procure these critical medical break -through when available. The capabilities of \\ndomestic Pharma and medical research will be enhanced through research grants for research and \\ninnovation in the area of COVID -19 cure.  \\nRegarding e conomic recovery, strong effort will be made to fully implement the stimulus packages \\nannounced in April -May 2020. The social protection delivery will be strengthened through a more rapid \\nimplementation of the NSSS and increase in funding for poverty -focus ed social protection programmes. \\nTopmost attention will be given to protect the jobs and enhance new jobs in the cottage, micro and small \\nenterprises (CMSEs) that presently employ an estimated 21 million people. This will be done immediately \\nthrough the pr ovision of low -cost loans through the banking sector. The Bangladesh Bank will work with \\ncommercial banks and the non -bank financial institutions how this can be done in a flexible and low -cost \\nmanner. All institutional or regulatory barriers will be remov ed to reach out t hese enterprises pro -actively.  \\nG. Accelerating Inclusive Growth  \\nThe inclusive growth strategy of 8FYP includes seven pivotal themes:  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote labour -intensive, export -oriented manufacturing -led growth along with expansion of the \\ndomestic mar ket; \\n\\uf0b7 Promote agricultural diversification;  \\n\\uf0b7 Infuse dynamism in CMS MEs; \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen modern services sector;  \\n\\uf0b7 Push exports of non -factor services;  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote ICT -based entrepreneurship embracing 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR);  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen overseas employment.  \\nThe main focus of inclusive growth strategy would be to create much more jobs through growth than was \\npossible in the 7FYP both to absorb those newly unemployed owing to COVID -19 and to reap the full \\nbenefits of the demographic dividend. Structural transformat ion during the 6th and the 7th Five Year Plans  xliv \\n have already laid the foundations for industry -led growth. Manufacturing sector has taken the lead \\nsupported by the expansion of RMG exports. This has increased the GDP growth rate, increased exports \\nand creat ed 4 million jobs in the RMG sector. However, non -RMG exports have not prospered that has \\nconstrained export diversification and slowed down manufacturing job creation in recent years, while the \\nRMG sector will continue to play its major role, the 8FYP gro wth strategy will put top priority to the \\nproduction and exports of non -RMG manufacturing to diversify the production and export base in areas \\nincluding processed food, leather and footwear, light engineering, and pharmaceuticals. Many of these \\nactivities,  like food processing and leather and footwear, are relatively labour intensive like RMG and have \\nhuge external market. So, like RMG they will create jobs and contribute to exports while accelerating value \\nadded growth. Emphasis will also be placed to prom ote efficient import substitution activities with high \\ndomestic demand, such as a range of consumer goods. Trade policy bias against exports will be removed \\nby reducing trade protection, the exchange rate will be made more flexible and competitive, and FDI  and \\ndomestic investment in manufacturing will be promoted through reforms of the investment climate to \\nimplement this strategy.  \\nIn agriculture, the strategy will be to further increase agriculture diversification while maintaining food \\nsecurity through i mprovements in farm productivity, supply of inputs, price policy support, water supply, \\nfarm credit and marketing support. Agriculture exports will be promoted to increase farm income and \\nemployment in non -crop activities especially fisheries, fruits, vege tables and dairy products. The \\nimplementation of the first phase of the BDP2100 public investment programme will strengthen water \\nmanagement, lower flood risk, reduce water logging and reduce soil salinity.  \\nThe CMS MEs hold the most promise for creating jo bs in both rural and urban areas. Global experience \\nfrom Japan, Taiwan and Korea show the powerful and dynamic role of CMS MEs for exports, growth and \\nemployment. Reviving the CMS MEs is the best way to create non -farm jobs in the economy. The less \\neducated youth population in particular are strongly reliant on CMS MEs jobs. The institutional and \\nfinancial support to CMS MEs will be vastly enhanced through the conversion of the SME Foundation into \\nSmall Business Agency (SBA) as in the USA that will serve as a o ne-stop shop to promote CMS MEs, \\nworking closely with the Bangladesh Bank on the financing side.  \\nThe services sector has already made substantial progress in converting from low -productivity informal \\nservices to high -productivity formal services in areas s uch as banking, finance, urban transport, ICT, health \\ncare, education and tourism. This transformation will be further enhanced by creating incentives for \\ndomestic and foreign private investment through regulatory reforms and supportive public investment i n \\nrelated infrastructure. A major growth and employment driver that will be supported is the expansion of \\nservices exports. There is a huge trade gap in international shipping services and efforts will be made to \\ncapture a larger share of this market. Expo rt prospects are also large in tourism and ICT services. These \\nexports are highly labour intensive and create employment, especially for educated youth. Indeed, the ICT \\nsector has begun to show dynamising in various services activities and holds huge prosp ects for further job \\ncreation for the educated youth. The 8FYP will boost ICT activities through reductions in ICT taxes, \\nthrough expansion of ICT education and training and through eliminating all regulatory barriers.   \\nThe overseas employment and remitta nces have played a major development role during the 6th and the 7th \\nPlans, creating jobs, providing income and investment. The youth population has benefitted most from \\noverseas jobs. Remittance inflows have not only lowered poverty through direct income transfers, they have  xlv \\n contributed to transforming the rural economy by supporting activities and employment in a range of rural \\nservices including construction, housing, transport, trading, health, and education. The 8FYP will build on \\nthis solid track reco rd and make further efforts to increase overseas employment and remittances. The \\nCOVID -19 has adversely affected overseas employment, but thankfully remittance inflows have remained \\nbuoyant owing to the 2% incentive offered by the government. The overseas employment crunch will likely \\nbe reversed once the global economy recovers. The 8FYP will make a comprehensive push to expand \\noverseas employment and remittance earnings through G2G negotiations, by lowering the cost of migration \\nthrough low -cost loans fro m the Bangladesh Probashi Bank, by increasing training and other services to \\npotential migrants, and by stronger support in the work place against exploitation and abuse in host \\ncountries through the local Bangladesh Embassies  and High Commissions . \\nH. Macroec onomic Framework for the 8FYP  \\nHigher growth on aggregate and at the sectoral level will require higher investment. The financing of this \\ninvestment will have to be done in a way that it does not create problems for macroeconomic stability. The \\n8th Plan wil l continue the emphasis on prudent macroeconomic management. Thus, the objective of higher \\ngrowth will be balanced with efforts to further reduce inflation to an average of 5.0% during the plan period. \\nFiscal deficit will increase in the first two years of  the Plan to adjust to the COVID -19 shock. But fiscal \\nprudence will be restored by increasing tax revenues to bring back the fiscal deficit to around 5% of GDP \\nby FY2023. The strong performance in the balance of payments will be preserved by promoting a st rong \\nand diversified export base, focused on both goods and non -factor services (NFS). The scope for increasing \\nexports of NFS is huge, given the large world market, with special emphasis on shipping, tourism, and ICT \\nservices (the gig market). Emphasis on  accelerating remittance inflows through new employment and \\nimproved skill base will be strengthened.   \\nCapital accumulation will continue to be the most important driver of growth.  Commensurate with the \\nexperiences of other UMIC, the capital intensity of  production will rise as income grows and the production \\nstructure changes. This is already happening in all sectors of Bangladesh including agriculture, RMG and \\nmodern services. With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the associated technology \\nchanges, Bangladesh manufacturing will need to adopt these new capital -intensive technologies to stay \\ncompetitive. Consequently, the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) will increase at the sectoral level \\nand on aggregate.  Therefore, a majo r challenge for the 8FYP would be to increase the investment rate from \\n32% of GDP in FY2020 to 37% of GDP in FY2025 to achieve the projected growth targets. Much of the \\nadditional investment will come from the private sector, with the private investment ra te projected to grow \\nfrom 23.6% of GDP in FY2020 to 27.4% of GDP in FY2025. This increase in private investment will only \\nbe possible by expanding the role of FDI. The global supply of FDI is large and Bangladesh hardly uses \\nthis potential. A key strategic  focus of the 8FYP would be to accelerate FDI inflows into Bangladesh \\nthrough a massive drive to improve the investment climate and strengthen the capabilities of BIDA to do \\npolicy -based research, advocacy and deliver speedy and efficient services to forei gn investors. Public \\ninvestment will also need to increase by an additional 1.2% of GDP to support growth through investments \\nin infrastructure and human capital.  \\nBased on the above strategy, total investment under the 8FYP will amount to Tk. 63.6 trillio n in constant \\nFY21 prices (the first year of the 8FYP), of which Tk. 47.5 trillion will come from the private sector (75%) \\nand Tk. 16.1 trillion will come from the public sector (25%). As in the past, domestic resources in the form  xlvi \\n of domestic savings will  continue to play a dominant role in the financing of the Eighth Plan (95%). Foreign \\nsavings will provide the remaining 5% of the net financing requirements for the 8FYP. This is a modest \\nrecourse to foreign resources is consistent with the governments cau tious approach to external debt.  \\nI. Public investment Programme and its Financing  \\nAs noted, accelerated private sector investment -both domestic and foreign -will be the key to the success of \\nthe Plan, the government’s role will be to create the investment -friendly environment, restore and \\nstrengthen human health and welfare in the post COVID -19 world, and ease infrastructure constraints. \\nPublic investment will grow from 8% of GDP in FY2019 to 9.2% of GDP by FY2025 and the total size of \\nthe 8FYP Public Investme nt Program (PIP) will be Tk. 16.1 trillion in FY2021 prices. Of this, some Tk. \\n11.9 trillion will be funded through the Annual Development Programme (ADP).  The main focus of the \\nADP will be to sharply improve and strengthen health infrastructure, to build  the social protection system, \\nalleviate infrastructure constraints to private investment and GDP growth by fast tracking nationally \\nimportant projects, and implement the BDP2100.   \\nTopmost priority will be given to develop the healthcare system through in creased budgetary allocations, \\nsharply stronger management and partnership with private healthcare. Budgetary allocations to the \\neducation sector will be increased to create better human capital through universal general education, skill \\ndevelopment progra mmes, and training and greater access to ICT solutions. Implementation of the National \\nSocial Security Strategy (NSSS)  will be fast -tracked to provide comprehensive social protection to all poor \\nand vulnerable citizens based on a modern Life Cycle based ap proach. In the area of infrastructure, in \\naddition to completing the ongoing transformational infrastructure projects, major initiatives will be taken \\nto broaden and accelerate the implementation of other major highways and bridges, power sector projects, \\nand providing access to serviced land to foreign and domestic investors in the context of the Special \\nEconomic Zones (SEZ) initiative. Infrastructure projects will be financed both through the ADP and \\nthrough an enhanced PPP effort. Finally, strong efforts  will be made to implement the first phase of the \\nBDP2100.  \\nTaking these considerations into account, Annual Budgets will be formulated in a manner that is consistent \\nwith the realization of the Eighth Plan objectives. Annual Budget and ADP will be synchro nized to use \\nthem as tools for achieving the objectives of the 8FYP. Financing of this large PIP will require strong \\nrevenue mobilization effort that has faced difficulties during the 7FYP. The fiscal framework of the 8FYP \\nwill implement the fiscal framewo rk of the PP2041 that calls for an increase in the tax to GDP ratio of 3.4 \\npercentage points, growing from 8.9% of GDP in FY2019 to 12.3% of GDP by FY2025 through \\nmodernization of tax policy and tax administration, focused on income and value -added taxes. The reliance \\non import taxes will be lowered to reduce the anti -export bias of trade policy. Prudent spending of public \\nsector resources for better public service delivery and incentive, subsidy and transfer programmes, and \\nimproved efficiency of public se ctor enterprises will be important for public sector resource efficiency and \\nproductivity. A modern property tax system will be introduced to increase revenues for local governments, \\nand SOEs including public banks will be reformed to earn profits and elim inate dependency on budget \\ntransfers. Additional revenues from these sources will amount to 1% of GDP by FY2025.  \\n  xlvii \\n J. Strategy for Human Development  \\nBangladesh gained international recognition for its achievement in human development when compared \\nwith count ries at similar levels per capita income. Yet, Bangladesh understands that the human development \\nrequirements of an UMIC need a much stronger effort than in the past.  The COVID -19 has reinforced the \\nimportance of transforming the health care system to hav e much stronger capacities to fight this \\nunprecedented pandemic. The healthcare response to COVID -19 was summarized under Section C above. \\nFrom the medium -term perspective, the 8FYP will increase budget allocation of healthcare spending from \\n0.7% of GDP in  2019 to 2.0% of GDP by FY2025, will sharply increase health care facilities, staffing, \\nequipment and supplies, will strengthen partnership with private sector, enhance district -level health care \\ncapabilities, and promote tele -health care through ICT solut ions. People’s access to safe water and \\nsanitation facilities will be enhanced to improve hygiene standards and protect human health.  Most \\nimportantly, the government will adopt a Universal Healthcare Policy learning from the experiences of \\nMalaysia and T hailand and combining public and private health insurance schemes as relevant. Regarding \\nnutrition, the 8FYP will accelerate the progress made in improving child and mother nutrition with a \\ncombination of augmented supply of nutritious food in general and through school mid -day meals, through \\neducation campaigns, through nutrition counselling in local health clinics, and through expansion of related \\nsocial security programmes.  \\nThe population management effort has focused on reducing total fertility and slo wing down population \\ngrowth rate through voluntary compliance based on education, health counselling and easy access to low -\\ncost birth control options. This strategy has paid off handsomely as the total fertility rate fell to a low of \\n2.1, approach replace ment rate population growth of 1.2% per year.  The focus in the 8FYP will shift more \\nonwards converting population as an asset as a part of the inclusion agenda whereby the emphasis will shift \\nto managing an ageing population, reducing maternal mortality t hrough greater access to birth attended by \\nskilled staff, reduction in early age female pregnancies, enhanced access to reproductive health education \\nand health care, increase in female labor force participation and better use of the youth population in th e \\ndevelopment process.        \\nPast progress in adult literacy, education and training has upgraded the skills of the workforce and \\ncontributed to the gains in average labor productivity. Yet the skills requirements of an UMIC in an \\nenvironment of the 4IR r equires considerable further progress. The 8FYP seek to achieve 100% adult \\nliteracy rate and will consolidate past gains in primary and secondary education to accelerate progress in \\ntertiary education. Most focus will be placed on education quality with em phasis on learning and acquiring \\nskills that are relevant to the work place.  Education quality will emphasize science, maths and ICT and \\ndeveloping problem solving skills.  Technical education will be promoted through expansion of the TVET \\nsystem. Trainin g programmes  will be vastly expanded through public -private partnerships, through on the \\njob training, and through partnership with NGOs and development partners. Primary and secondary \\neducation will be decentralized to district level, teacher training wil l be expanded, private provision of \\neducation and training will be promoted, and the education budget will grow from 2.0% of GDP in FY2019 \\nto 3.0% of GDP by FY2025.  \\n \\n  xlviii  \\n K. Poverty Reduction, Social Protection and Inclusion  \\nBangladesh has a solid track record o f reducing poverty. Before COVID -19 struck, poverty rate had \\ndeclined to 20.5% in 2019 and extreme poverty incidence fell to 10.5%. This is a strong testimony to the \\nsuccess of the development strategies over the past decade. COVID -19 temporarily caused a spike in \\npoverty owing to the loss of income and employment for many poor and vulnerable households. The 8FYP \\nwill put top priority to reverse this income loss through job creation and transfer payments with a view to \\nrestoring the momentum of poverty redu ction to the path envisaged in PP2041, whereby the target is to \\neliminate extreme poverty by FY2031. The poverty reduction strategy for the 8FYP will build on past \\nsuccesses and strengthen effort where necessary. Thus, a combination of the implementation o f the \\ninclusive growth strategy described above that will create jobs and provide higher real income to the poor, \\nimplementation of the above -mentioned human development strategy that will improve education and skills \\nof the poor and vulnerable population,  inflow of remittance income with enhanced participation from \\nlagging districts, greater supply of credit through the micro -finance institutions as well as the commercial \\nbanks, and  expanded social protection system will form the core elements of the pove rty strategy.  \\nWhile this strategy is broadly similar to the past strategy, the 8FYP poverty strategy will be enhanced in a \\nnumber of ways. First, the growth strategy will have much stronger focus on job creation than during the \\n7FYP. Second, special atten tion will be given to reduce poverty in the poorest 10 districts through \\ninfrastructure supply, credit and social protection income transfers.  Third, the planned introduction of \\nUniversal Health Care (UHC) will vastly lower the exposure of the poor to a m ajor source of economic \\nshock. Fourth, a major structural improvement in the poverty reduction strategy will be the implementation \\nof a much stronger social protection system nationwide based on the fast -track implementation of the NSSS \\nand higher spending  on social protection programmes for the urban and rural poor and vulnerable \\npopulation. The 8FYP will expand the budget allocation for social protection for the poor (excluding civil \\nservice pensions which is not targeted to the poor) from 1.2% of GDP in FY2019 to 2% of GDP by FY2025.  \\nFinally, the 8FYP will make the digital/ mobile financial services (DFS/MFS) system more effective in \\nachieving financial inclusion of the poor and marginalized groups. Specific policy interventions include: \\nstrengthening th e national identification database, improving the payments infrastructure including the \\nestablishment of the interoperability amongst digital financial service providers, promoting innovations to \\nmake DFS services more supportive of growth of small busines s holders, and eliminating gender disparity \\nin financial inclusion. These specific strategical enhancements will help reduce income inequality and \\nincrease the poverty elasticity of growth.  \\nAlong with poverty reduction, social inclusion strategy will be s trengthened during the 8FYP. On the gender \\nfront, the 8FYP will focus on increasing economic empowerment and better implementation of the 2011 \\nNWDP. Women’s labor force participation will be increased through closing the gap between male and \\nfemale enrollm ents in tertiary education, especially in TVET, better access to training programmes, \\nimproving child care availability, improving safety of women’s movements and in the work place, and \\nincreasing access to basic facilities like toilet and sanitary napkins  in the work place. The strategy for the \\nchildren’s advancement during the 8FYP will emphasize full implementation of all child protection laws \\nand reduction in child poverty through strengthened social protection benefits based on a reformulated \\nChild Ben efits Program as envisaged in the NSSS.   xlix \\n The inclusion strategy for ethnic minorities, the physically challenged and the under -privileged groups that \\nface social discrimination on the basis of their profession will remain ingrained as before on the \\nimpleme ntation of the Constitution that provides equal rights and opportunities to all citizens irrespective \\nof race, religion, caste, creed or profession. Bangladesh takes great pride in eliminating all legal and \\nregulatory restrictions to inclusion and for buil ding in affirmative actions in its social development policies \\nto protect social inclusion. Inclusion policies are well defined but implementation is limited by \\nadministrative capacity constraints at the local level. The strategy for the 8FYP will place sp ecial emphasis \\non improving administrative capacity at both the ministerial and local government levels and strengthening \\npartnerships with civil society organizations.  \\nL. Strategy for Infrastructure Development  \\nThe top priority given to infrastructure devel opment during the 6th and 7th Plans has paid off well in boosting \\nGDP growth during the past 10 years. The progress is particularly remarkable in power supply where the \\ncountry has moved from a power deficit country to a self -sufficient position owing to a  massive expansion \\nprogramme funded through public and private enterprises. Progress was also made in implementing power \\ntrade and in initiating a diversification of primary energy to LNG and coal. The LNG and imported coal \\nfuel options -based investments a re ongoing and will start production during FY2022 -FY2023. The 8FYP \\npower and energy strategy will continue the ongoing good work and strengthen the strategy in several areas. \\nFirst, the Power Sector Master Plan 2016 (PSMP) will be updated and power expans ion programmes  will \\nbe based on updated demand projections, better use of existing capacity and selection of least -cost options \\nfor new generation. Second, emphasis will be placed on renewable energy trough proper fuel -oil pricing \\nand other incentives. Thi rd, the power and energy sector finances will be improved through institutional \\nreforms and pricing policies. Fourth, energy conservation and efficiency improvements will be promoted \\nthrough proper O&M of power facilities, through adoption of energy effici ent technology, and through \\npricing and taxation of energy consumption.  \\nThe transport sector strategy in the 8FYP will follow the strategy initiated in the 7FYP with an emphasis in \\nareas where performance gaps exist. Thus, the strategy would be to develop an efficient, sustainable, safe \\nand regionally balanced transportation system in which various modes complement each other, interface \\nappropriately and, where possible, provide healthy competition to each other. Special emphasis will be \\nplaced on the i ntroduction of modern technology for increasing capacity and improving quality and \\nproductivity of the system, development of the two seaports with smooth transport links to Dhaka, \\nestablishment of effective railway linkages between the east and west zones of the country, integration of road, \\nrail and inland water transport, and participation in global and regional transport connectivity initiatives that \\nhelp develop the land route links between South Asia and East Asia through Bangladesh. On the investment \\nside, the strategy would continue to prioritize timely completion of all transformational transport infrastructure \\nprojects consisting of inter -city bridges, highways, tunnels, and sea ports that helps modernize the Bangladesh \\ntransport network so as to impro ve the mobility of goods and services across the nation, facilitate international \\ntrade, reduce cost and improve competitiveness. These transformational projects are highly capital intensive, \\nare multi -year in nature, and require strong supervision to avoi d cost over -runs and delays. The 8FYP will \\nmaintain the priority given to mass urban transit facilities and will speed up the completion of MRT Line -6 (the \\nfirst elevated Metro Rail of Bangladesh) by December 2021.   l \\n Mindful of the resource constraints and high investment costs, the 8FYP financing strategy would combine \\nADP allocations with a strong public -private -partnership (PPP) effort.  The PPP institution will be strengthened \\nwith internationally competent staff with experience in negotiating and managi ng international PPP contracts. \\nThe 8FYP would put special emphasis to improve the inter -modal transport balance, where progress was \\nlimited during the 7FYP, with greater emphasis on inland waterways that are low -cost in nature and are \\nenvironment  friendly . The importance of transport, especially air transport, for tourism would be emphasized \\nwith a focus on strengthening inter -district airline connectivity and the construction of a new international \\ntransport. Greater efforts will be made to improve resour ce mobilization through the introduction of user \\ncharges and fees for a range of public transport services including road user charges, air and sea port fees, \\ninland water and rail fares.  \\nM. Digital Bangladesh and Information Communications Technology (ICT)  \\nThe productivity of the labour force depends on education and training, capital stock and technology. The \\nICT revolution implemented through the Digital Bangladesh initiative of Hon’ble Prime Minister Sheikh \\nHasina launched in 2009 holds the promise of lift ing labor productivity and citizen welfare through the \\nadoption of mobile technology. Bangladesh has already made solid progress during the Sixth and Seventh \\nPlans. Importantly, the critical role of ICT came to the fore in the wake of COVID -19 pandemic. Ph ysical \\ndistancing requirements that closed down physical office, business and education enterprises and threatened \\nto disrupt all related activities, are being offset by use of ICT communications through video conferencing. \\nA wide range of services in dive rse field including banking, health care, education, business management, \\npublic administration, consulting and retail trade where physical presence is not needed are now being \\nconducted virtually online through use of ICT facilities. This has already revo lutionized the concept of the \\nwork space from office space with mass gathering to individual home -office.  Productivity improvements \\nhave happened through saving of commuter time and financial cost.  \\nDespite progress, as suggested by international compariso n of availability and use of ICT facilities in \\nBangladesh, there is still a long way to go. A range of policy and institutional constraints will need to be \\ntackled during the 8FYP to further implement the Digital Bangladesh to its fuller potential. A major  \\nchallenge in this regard is the need to reassess the inconsistency in the tax policy that tends to burden this \\nsector with a tax overload, thereby constraining private investment in ICT infrastructure. Higher service \\ncost owing to taxation lowers consumer  demand, thereby constraining the adoption of ICT services. This \\ntaxation problem will be addressed speedily to enable stronger progress with ICT during the 8FYP.     \\nPublic investment will focus on the supply of fixed infrastructure while public policy wi ll facilitate the \\nprivate sector expansion of mobile phone technology to unserved areas, incentivize the use of mobile \\ntechnology, especially in rural areas, and support a more rapid growth of higher value -added mobile \\nservices such as internet, video phon e and data services. Export of ICT services including software \\ndevelopment will be promoted through fiscal incentives.  More rapid adoption of e -services in public sector \\nwill be encouraged through a program me of digitization of public services including s taff training. Special \\neffort will be made to augment ICT education and availability of skilled ICT staff.  Emphasis will be placed \\non development of ICT soft wares for exports through investments in Technology Parks and public \\ninvestment in ICT research a nd development  \\n  li \\n N. Managing the Urban Transition  \\nAs Bangladesh moves from LMIC to UMIC, the urbanization of the country will continue to expand.  The \\ngrowing pressure on urban land, water, power, transport, waste management and housing are already being \\nfelt in all urban centers of Bangladesh, but especially in the capital city of Dhaka and the port city of \\nChattogram . The manufacturing sector, which is the main engine for higher growth, is facing increasing \\nchallenges from higher land prices, traffic congesti on and pressure on urban infrastructure. The Government \\nunderstands that this urbanization challenge will need to be managed efficiently to ensure the sustainability \\nof the growth effort. Accordingly, the PP2041 develops a long -term road map to manage smoo thly the \\nurban transition.  The 8FYP will essentially implement that strategy.  \\nDrawing on PP2041 urbanization strategy, the 8FYP urbanization strategy is grounded in the reality that in \\na market economy urbanization will be linked to the growth of economi c activities.  The role of public \\npolicy to influence the pattern of urbanization will depend upon incentives, regulations, public  investments \\nand institutions. Global experience clearly shows the need for decentralized and autonomous urban \\ngovernments as a key part of the political and administrative layout underlying an UMIC. A sound strategy \\nfor reforming city management calls for a three -pronged approach: (i) redefining public -private roles with \\na view to strengthening this partnership for better servic es; (ii) strengthening capabilities of public urban \\nservice institutions; and (iii) establishing an accountable city government with fiscal decentralization .  \\nAlong with institutional reforms to promote the development of strong local government institutio ns \\n(LGIs), the 8FYP will invest heavily in critical urban services like water supply, drainage, sanitation and \\nwaste management. In particular, the access to safe water and sanitation will be enhanced in both urban and \\nrural areas to improve health and fig ht the COVID -19 infection. Urban housing would be promoted through \\nregulatory simplifications relating to land and property registration, reduction in registration fee, and \\nstrengthening of housing mortgage finance.  \\nThe funding needs of the urban sector a re large. Without fiscal decentralization, service delivery will \\ncontinue to be inadequate because ADP funding is limited. The 8FYP will accordingly take measures to \\nenhance fiscal decentralization by taking a criteria -based approach to transfers to city c orporations and \\nMunicipalities. These criteria may include population, poverty, and performance. LGIs, both urban and \\nrural, will be empowered with the use of three other financing strategies. The first is tax mobilization \\nthrough a modern property tax sys tem as found in UMIC. The second involves private financing, and the \\nthird relates to a strong cost recovery policy for urban services. While LGI tax resources and national \\ngovernment transfers will help finance operating costs of the city government and s pending program mes \\non public goods like local roads, drainage systems, parks and maintenance of water bodies, cost recovery \\nwill play a dominant role for such services as water supply, sewerage and solid waste disposal. Private \\nprovision of these commercia l services will also be encouraged.  Urban housing would be a pre -dominantly \\nprivate sector activity.  Government subsidy and grants will be provided for low -cost housing for the poor.   \\nO. Sustainable Development  \\nMany laws and regulations have been enacted over the years to protect the environment and programmes \\nand policies are in place to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. This progress continued \\nunder the 6th FYP and 7th FYP, with special emphasis on air and water pollution control.  Important steps  lii \\n were also taken to improve biodiversity and implement climate change adaptation pilot programmes \\nthrough the BCCTF resources. An important breakthrough on the strategy and policy front happened \\nrecently with the adoption of the BDP 2100 in  September 2018. As noted, the implementation of this \\ncomprehensive long -term strategy for managing the risks posed by the deltaic formation of the country \\nalong with the incidence of natural disasters and climate change will substantially reduce the vulne rability \\nof the population to climate change and natural disasters.  \\nFundamentally, the main focus of the 8FYP sustainable development strategy is to initiate the first phase \\nimplementation of PP2041 environmental management strategy. By integrating enviro nment and climate \\nchange considerations in the growth strategy., as proposed under PP2041, Bangladesh will adopt a green \\ngrowth strategy.  The specific strategies, policies and institutional reforms include: (a) Integrating \\nenvironmental costs into the Mac roeconomic Framework; (b) Implementing the Delta Plan to build \\nresilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change; (c) Reduce air and water pollution; (d) Removal of \\nfuel subsidies; (e) Adoption of green tax on fossil fuel consumption; (f) Taxation of e mission from industrial \\nunits; and (g) Prevention of surface water pollution.  \\nIn the first phase of implementation, the 8FYP will prioritize the ongoing efforts to reduce air and water \\npollution, strengthen forestry management and implement the BDP2100. E fforts will be made to build up \\ninstitutional capabilities, policies and regulations for the implementation of environmental fiscal reforms \\n(EFR) and the development of the green growth strategy. Proper coordination with global climate change \\nprogrammes wi ll be maintained along with stronger efforts to mobilize global climate change resources.   \\nP. Strengthening Public Institutions and Governance  \\nConsistent with the long -term goal of PP2041 to attain upper middle -income status in FY2031 and high - \\nincome status  in FY2041, the government’s institutional and governance improvement goals will target a \\ntime path to attain the institutional set up found in present day UMICs. The priorities for the 8FYP include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Further strengthening of the democratic governance proc ess to ensure participation of all citizens and \\nthe sound functioning of all democratic institutions.   \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening of the local government institutions based on a well -defined legal framework that assigns \\nresponsibilities along with commensurate financi al autonomy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen service delivery through implementing online transactions for all public services with \\nsimplified application forms, pre -announced service response timelines and service charges, and an \\nonline grievance redressal system.  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial and legal support to the judiciary to strengthen its capacity to ensure faster disposal of civil \\nand criminal cases.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening of the Bangladesh Bank with recruitment of high -quality staff and implementation of all \\nprudential regulations for the entir e banking system.  Urgent reform of public banks to reduce non -\\nperforming loans, bad lending decisions and to earn profit with zero recourse to Treasury funding.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strong implementation of the PP2041 fiscal framework with a special focus on strengthening per sonal \\nand corporate income tax collections and the VAT through modernization of the tax system. Tax forms \\nwill be simplified and tax filing and payments will be made online with no interface between tax \\ncollector and tax payer.  Audit will be limited, prod uctive and criteria driven.  Consideration will be \\ngiven to separate tax policy from tax collection.   liii \\n \\uf0b7 The SOEs will be urgently reformed to reduce leakage of resources and to enable all enterprises to fully \\nrecover cost and earn a reasonable rate of return on assets.  A hard budget constraint will be imposed \\non all SOEs.  \\n\\uf0b7 The government’s policy of zero tolerance of corruption will be enforced strictly with information on \\nactions shared publicly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening the Anti -Corruption Commission in securing better  quality investigations and fair \\nresolutions.  \\nQ. Development Results Framework (DRF)  \\nA major institutional reform that has happened in the approach to planning in Bangladesh is the \\ninternalization of an effective results -based Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) st rategy to monitor the \\nimplementation of the Plan and associated programmes.  The 8FYP adopts a better informed and owned \\ndevelopment results framework (DRF), drawing on the good experiences of the 6th and 7th Plans. Both core \\nmacro and sectoral quantitativ e results will be monitored to measure the effective implementation of the 8th \\nPlan. A mid -term review of implementation progress is planned for end 2023, while a final implementation \\nreview will be done in end 2025 after the completion of the Plan.  \\nThe Ba ngladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) will be empowered for data collection drives for DRF, including \\nMICS, Urban child wellbeing survey, vulnerable pocket -based survey, including implementation of \\nnational data quality assurance framework for administrative  data from ministries for SDGs, including SDG \\ndata monitoring. GED, BBS along with ministries will promote partnerships with independent agencies for \\ncollecting data and reporting for specific projects.  \\nBBS can help to make significant advances in the pot ential for data analysis and use, which would help to \\nimprove the lives of population especially women and children in Bangladesh. With government \\ninvestment, focused efforts can ensure data will be more useful and accessible to (1) Deliver on the SDGs  \\nby improving management information systems that collect data at the point of service delivery and by \\nenabling access to local administrative data via portals, (2) Stimulate demand for data  by making data more \\naccessible for those responsible for decision -making as well as those seeking to hold them to account, and \\n(3) Harmonize investments,  roles, and responsibilities – across both government and development \\npartners/agencies – to reduce overlaps and increase efficiency and effectiveness.  \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPart 1 \\nMAC ROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE: \\nSTRATEGIC DIRECTIONS AND  \\nPOLICY FRAMEWORK    \\n    1 \\n CHAPTER 1 \\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRESS UNDER THE SEVENTH PLAN  \\n1.1 OVERVIEW  \\nThe Seventh Five Year Plan (7FYP) was adopted in July 2015, as continuation of the government’s efforts \\nto implement the Vi sion 2021 and the associated Perspective Plan 2021 (PP2021). The 6FYP had started \\nthe process of implementing PP2021 and the 7FYP sought to complete this task.  Considerable progress \\nwas made under the 6FYP, but the government was aware that there was an u nfinished agenda in relation \\nto development goals envisioned in the PP2021 that needed to be addressed. The 7FYP therefore reviewed \\nthe progress made in the 6FYP, identified the main gaps and set the appropriate goals, targets and strategies \\nas the next st ep to the completion of the PP2021 development agenda and the implementation of the UN -\\nsupported Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs).  \\nThis continuity in medium -term development planning that is linked to a long -term development vision \\nwith scope for mid-term corrections has served Bangladesh well by providing it with a flexible development \\nplanning instrument that is dynamic and adaptive in nature. This is especially relevant in the context of the \\nongoing Corona Virus (COVID -19) pandemic that has deva sted the global economy with substantial \\ndownside implications for Bangladesh.  Bangladesh adopted a new Perspective Plan 2041 (PP2041) that \\ndefines a long -term vision of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s dream of a \\npoverty -free and prosperous Bangladesh. The Eighth Five Year Plan (8FYP) is the first in the series of 4 \\nmedium term development plans aimed at implementing the PP2041. The lessons from the adaptive and \\ndynamic use of the Sixth and Seventh Plan as instruments for imple menting the PP2021 including the \\nadjustment to the COVID -19 impact will be particularly useful in the implementation of the 8FYP as it \\nstarts it journey in the backdrop of a massive and unprecedented global crisis.    \\nThis chapter provides a big picture re view of the implementation of the 7FYP with a view to highlighting \\nthe areas of major achievements and progress and identifying areas where there have been implementation \\ngaps.  This analysis provides a benchmark for setting the objectives, targets and pri orities for the Eighth \\nPlan and the associated macroeconomic and sectoral strategies, policies and programmes. The relevant \\nchapters of the Eighth Plan also provide more details of sectoral performance in the Seventh Plan to set the \\ndevelopment context for  the sectoral objectives and strategies of the Eighth Plan.   \\nIn order to provide a fair assessment of the true performance of the 7FYP implementation, analytically it is \\nimportant to delink the COVID -19 short -term adverse impact from the medium -term trend -based \\nperformance from July 2015 to February 2020. The COVID -19 impact started unfolding from March 2020. \\nThe assessment of the 7FYP performance is therefore based on results of the first 4 years of the plan period, \\nthat is from FY2016 -FY2019. The FY2020 performance is reviewed separately in the context of available \\ninformation on the impact of COVID -19. The actual FY2020 outcome will likely change as better and more \\ncurrent data is available in the July -August periods.   2 \\n 1.2 PROGRESS WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH, ECONO MIC TRANSFORMATION \\nAND JOB CREATION  \\nThe 7FYP made strong progress in achieving the growth and structural transformation targets. GDP growth \\naccelerated as envisaged in the 6FYP. Bangladesh is now amongst the fastest growing countries in the \\nWorld. The tran sformation of the production structure away from agriculture to industry and modern \\nservices was further enhanced during the 7FYP. This provides a sound basis for further transformation \\nduring the Eighth Plan. The area where progress has been more halting concerns job creation. While \\nagriculture continued to transform from a pre -dominantly peasant production system towards a more \\ncommercially -oriented production structure and thereby continued to shed labour, manufacturing and \\norganized services sectors did  not show the dynamism in the area of job creation that was expected in the \\n7FYP.  As a result, total job creation in these activities was lower than expected, which drove down the rate \\nof labour absorption in these activities.   \\n1.2.1  GDP Growth  \\nThe GDP o utcomes during the various 5 -year plan periods is shown in Table 1.1. Bangladesh has increased \\nits average GDP growth rate since the 4FYP. The average growth rate gained speed during the 6FYP and \\nfurther accelerated to 7.6% during the first 4 years of 7FYP  period. However, due to COVID -19, the actual \\naverage GDP growth rate stands at 7.13% covering the whole 7FYP period. Progress with fertility \\nmanagement and consequent rapid reduction in the population growth rate helped increase per capita GDP \\nprogressive ly, reaching an impressive rate of 6.2% during the 7FYP.  \\nRapid growth in per capita GDP along with continued generous inflow of remittances helped a progressive \\nincrease in per capita gross national income (GNI). By 2015 Bangladesh had already crossed the  threshold \\nfor the World Bank defined lower middle -income country (LMIC). Rapid increase in per capita GNI during \\nthe 7FYP set Bangladesh well on the road towards an upper middle - income country (UMIC). In 2018 \\nBangladesh qualified to graduate from the lis t of the least developed countries.  In FY2020, per capita GNI \\nalready reached the US $2064.   \\nTable 1.1: GDP Growth in Various Five Year Plan Periods  \\nSpecific Plan  Plan Period \\n(FY)  Average GDP Growth Rate  Per Capita GDP \\nGrowth (%)  Per Capita GNI \\n(US$)*  Plan (%)  Actual (%)  \\nFirst Plan  1973 -1978  5.5 4.0 1.3 111 \\nSecond Plan  1980 -1985  5.4 3.8 1.5 145 \\nThird Plan  1985 -1990  5.4 3.8 1.6 204 \\nFourth Plan  1990 -1995  5.0 4.2 2.4 253 \\nFifth Plan  1997 -2002  7.1 5.1 3.5 431 \\nSixth Plan  2011 -2015  7.3 6.3 4.9 1314  \\nSeventh Plan  2016 -2020  7.4 7.13 5.73 2064  \\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) *Per Capita GNI of the terminal year of the FYP  \\nThe GDP growth acceleration achieved during the Seventh Plan put Bangladesh on the global map as \\namongst the fastest gr owing countries of the World (Figure 1.1). The fact that the average GDP growth rate \\nin Bangladesh during 2016 -2020 exceeded those achieved in China and India is truly remarkable and speaks  3 \\n volumes about the highly successful growth strategy during the 7FY P. This performance also laid the \\nfoundations for aspiring to secure UMIC status by the end of FY2031.  \\nFigure 1.1: 7FYP Growth Performance in International Context (% p.a. 2016 -2019)  \\n \\nSources: Global Economic Prospects, June 2019 and January 2020, World B ank Group  \\n1.2.2  Structural Change and Economic Transformation  \\nConsistent with the 6FYP and PP2021 strategies, the 7FYP development strategy emphasized the need to \\nincrease the production share of industry and modern services while reducing the dependence o n agriculture \\nand informal services. It also continued the emphasis on reducing the gap between rural and urban \\neconomies by strengthening the nonfarm sectors of the rural economy. On the industrial front, most \\nemphasis was placed on enhancing the growth o f the manufacturing sector to 11.5% during FY2016 -2020. \\nMuch of this growth was projected to come from export -oriented manufacturing sector. Additionally, the \\nservices sector was projected to grow at 6.5% average growth, supported by substantial increases in the \\ngrowth of modern services and service exports. While agriculture was expected to grow at a modest rate of \\n3.3%, the rural economy was expected to undergo important structural changes with expansion in rural non -\\nfarm activities in manufacturing, trad e, construction, transport and services.  \\nTable 1.2 shows that substantial progress was made in further transforming the production structure. The \\nexpansion of the manufacturing sector, growing by an average rate of 12.7%, contributed most to improving \\nthe production structure. Owing to this strong growth, its GDP share increased from 19% in FY2015 to \\n23% in FY2019. Construction sector also performed strongly. Consequently, the share of industry in total \\nGDP expanded from 29% in FY2015 to 35% in FY2019. The  services sector also grew at an average rate \\nof 6.5%, which is a robust performance. Importantly, the composition of the services sector changed in \\nfavour of modern services supported by solid growth in activities such as banking, other financial services , \\norganized transport (air, rail, shipping and roads transport), telecommunications, information \\ncommunications technology (ICT), education and health services.   7.56.46.65.13.34.11.22.41.92.7\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8BangladeshChinaIndiaIndonesiaThailandDeveloping CountriesLatin AmericaSub-Saharan AfricaOECDWorld 4 \\n Table 1.2: Structural Change in the Economy During the Seventh Plan  \\n (% of GDP Constant Price s)  \\nStructure of the Economy  FY2015  FY2019  \\nAgriculture  15.36  13.61  \\nShare of non -crop agriculture  (44.90)  (48.13)  \\nIndustry  29.19  34.57  \\nof which Manufacturing  (19.35)  (23.27)  \\nServices  55.45  51.82  \\nSource: National Accounts Statistics, Bangladesh Bureau  of Statistics (BBS)  \\nConsiderable progress was also made in the diversification of the rural economy. Already during the Sixth \\nPlan, the rural economy had been transforming from a pre -dominantly agriculture - based production \\nstructure towards more non -farm -based production activities. The Seventh Plan further pushed this \\ntransformation. Evidence shows that agriculture is no longer the pre -dominant source of income in the rural \\neconomy. Within agriculture there has been a slow and steady transformation from cereals to protein -based \\nproduction such as fisheries, livestock, poultry, dairy -products, fruits and vegetables and flowers. \\nImportantly, the export -oriented fisheries sector has taken up a big role as a source of farm income in \\nBangladesh. Thus, the shar e of fisheries in agricultural value -added expanded from 23% in FY2015 to 26% \\nin FY2019.  \\nThe growth of rural non -farm enterprises is rapidly changing the Bangladesh rural landscape. Non -farm job \\ncreation combined with diversification within agriculture an d generous inflow of overseas remittance \\nincome has created a strong demand base for a number of rural activities related to rural manufacturing, \\nconstruction, housing, education, health, trade, transport and ICT.  The availability of electricity and \\nimpro ved rural roads along with better connectivity to rural and urban markets through ICT and transport \\nnetworks has facilitated this rural transformation. In particular, use of ICT solutions and reduction in time \\nrelated to transport of people and goods has i mproved the flow of information and lowered the transaction \\ncosts, thereby increasing rural incomes. The progress on rural transformation is very re -assuring and \\nprovides a strong basis to move forward further in the Eighth Plan.   \\n1.2.3  Progress with Inve stment  \\nAs in the past, capital formation was the most important driver of growth. Recognizing the importance of \\ncapital formation for growth acceleration, the 7FYP set strong targets for both public and private \\ninvestment. Substantial progress was made in securing the planned investment targets. The public \\ninvestment rate even exceeded the target set for the 7FYP. This is somewhat surprising given the revenue \\nconstraints faced by the government, the revenue shortfalls were offset by government controls over  current \\nspending that protected development spending and also by the expansion of investments by public \\nautonomous corporations from retained earnings and depreciation funds. Private investment also expanded \\nbut fell short of target. Some of the shortfall  in private investment is accounted for by the sluggish \\nperformance of foreign direct investment (FDI) and by the inability of the investment effort under the \\npublic -private partnership (PPP) initiative. Both these areas would require renewed efforts in th e 8FYP, \\nwith particular attention to improving the investment climate for private investment.   \\n  5 \\n Table 1.3.

As a result of the ongo ing demographic transition, whereby the share \\nof the working population is increasing, the projected growth in the labour force in the 7FYP was 2.9% per \\nannum, which is considerably faster than the population growth rate (1.37% per annum). This was based \\non the latest labour force data of 2010 (LFS 2010) that was available at the time when the 7FYP was drafted. \\nIt showed both a rising share of the working population to total population (the demographic dividend) and \\na rising share of female labour force par ticipation. The 7FYP saw this as a challenge to create sufficient \\nnumber of jobs to absorb this growing labour force as well as to reduce underemployment. Accordingly, \\nthe 7FYP targeted employment to expand at an average pace of 2.6 million per year.  \\nThe s econd dimension of the 7FYP employment target was related to the quality aspects. While the \\nagriculture sector’s employment share in total employment has been falling, it still is the largest source of \\nemployment. Research shows that labour productivity an d real wages are higher in manufacturing and \\nservices sectors, especially organized services. Research also shows that job quality in terms of \\nremuneration and benefits tend to be better on average in formal employment relative to employment in \\ninformal se ctors. Accordingly, a major objective of the Seventh Plan was to create more jobs in \\nmanufacturing and organized services relative to agriculture and the informal economy.  \\nThe third dimension relates to the special challenge presented by the growing incid ence of youth \\nunemployment, especially educated unemployed youth. The government is acutely aware of the social \\nconsequences of a large incidence of unemployed youth, especially educated unemployed youth. The 7FYP \\naimed to substantially reduce the youth un employment rate.  \\nEmployment strategy:  The employment strategy of the Seventh Plan was based on four pillars:  \\nFirst, was the effort to expand the rate of the growth of the economy, with special emphasis on \\nmanufacturing and organized services.   \\nSecond, th e Seventh Plan took note of the fact that Bangladesh being a labour abundant economy, it will \\nhave a comparative advantage in producing and exporting labour intensive products. The experience from \\nRMG manufacturing provides a very strong foundation to this  analytical basis of the Seventh Plan.  6 \\n Accordingly, the 7FYP emphasized the expansion of RMG exports while also seeking to diversify the \\nexport base through the promotion of non -RMG exports.  \\nThird, the Seventh Plan sought to build on the successes achieved  in the export of labour services especially \\nto the Middle East through a number of policies including information sharing at the district level, easing \\nup remittance inflows through banking sector, providing exchange rate incentives, providing training \\nsupport to potential migrants, and preventing exploitative behaviour of private employment exchanges.  \\nFourth and finally, the government took a number of steps to boost youth employment by adopting the \\nNational Youth Policy 2017, by strengthening the implem entation of technical and vocational education, \\nadopting and implementing a number of skills upgradation projects such as STEP and SEIP, and \\nstrengthening the implementation of ICT.  \\nSeventh Plan employment outcome : The latest available labour force data r efers to the LFS 2016 -17. \\nOwing to this,  the approach followed to estimate domestic employment is to use the national employment \\nelasticity between 2010 and 2017 and apply that to the average GDP growth for the 7FYP. Data on overseas \\nemployment are obtaine d directly from the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET). The \\nestimated results are shown in Table 1.4.  \\nTable 1.4: Estimated Job Creation in the Seventh Plan (million workers)  \\n FY2020 (Plan \\nTarget)  7FYP Annual \\nAverage  FY 2019 \\n(Estimated)  Actual Annual \\nAverage  \\nDomestic Employment  10.9 2.2 4.6 1.2 \\nOverseas Employment  2.0 0.4 2.8 0.7 \\nTotal Employment  12.9 2.6 7.4 1.9 \\nAdditional Labour Force  9.9 2.0 4.2 1.1 \\nSource: LFS 2016 -17; GED Estimates  \\nSeveral important results emerge. First, total job  creation of 7.4 million during the first 4 years of the 7FYP \\nsuggests that actual job creation for the full plan would have fallen much short of the targeted 12.9 million \\neven if there was no COVID -19. Second, the shortfall is particularly large in domest ic job creation; only \\n4.6 million estimated new jobs were created in the domestic economy in the first 4 years of the 7FYP as \\ncompared with the projected target of 10.9 million for the full plan. In other words, the 7FYP target was to \\ncreate some 2.2 milli on domestic jobs per year, but actual job creation is estimated at 1.2 million per year. \\nThird, while domestic job creation fell below target, job creation abroad was much above target (0.7 million \\nper year actual overseas jobs as compared with a target of  0.4 million). This was a huge boost to the \\nBangladesh economy both in terms of the number of jobs created and inflow of remittances. Importantly, \\nit substantially offset the adverse effects of slower job creation in the domestic economy for unemployment \\nand growth in real wages. Finally, a major surprising result is the substantial unanticipated slowdown in the \\ngrowth of the domestic labour force. According to the latest available labour force survey of 2016 -17 (LFS \\n2016 -17), as compared with a projected l abour force growth of 2.9% per year in the 7FYP, the actual labour \\nforce grew at an average pace of 1.6% per year between 2010 and 2017. As a result, the actual annual new \\nentrants to the job market was only 1.1 million compared to the 2 million projected in the 7FYP. This \\nsurprising result is partly explained by the stagnation in the labour force participation rate of the female \\npopulation at around 36%. It also reflects the fact that the expected increase in the share of the working age  7 \\n population to tota l population did not happen. This is explained by several factors including a greater share \\nof youth in age group 15 -24 remaining in education instead of entering the workforce, a rising share of the \\nyouth population that is not in employment, education or  training (NEET), and a rising share of old age \\n(64+) population. So, when total new domestic jobs are compared with the actual addition to labour force, \\nthe result is less disappointing. Nevertheless, in view of substantial underemployment and the fact th at 10% \\nof employment is unpaid family labour, the domestic job creation performance of the 7FYP was below the \\ntarget.  \\nDue to the structural transformation, the labour exodus from agricultural sector continued and employment \\nactually shrunk in numbers, but employment in manufacturing and construction did not grow as expected \\n(Table 1.5). Despite an acceleration in the manufacturing sector growth to 10.4% per year between 2010 -\\n2017, manufacturing employment grew very modestly at an annual rate of 4%. As a res ult, employment \\nelasticity of manufacturing sector fell sharply to a low of only 0.39 between 2010 and 2017. The \\nconstruction sector employment similarly exhibited a low employment elasticity of only 0.4 (Table 1.6).  \\nTable 1.5: Employment Progress during the 7FYP  \\nSectors  FY2015  \\n(million workers)  FY2019  \\n(million Workers)  FY2015  \\n(percent share)  FY2019  \\n(percent share)  \\nAgriculture  25.8 24.2 44.0 38.2 \\nIndustry  11.5 13.6 19.5 21.6 \\n(Manufacturing)  (8.6)  (9.8)  14.7 15.5 \\nServices  21.4 25.4 36.5 40.1 \\nTotal  58.7 63.3 100.0  100.0  \\nSource: GED estimates based on LFS data and using sectoral employment elasticities between 2010 & 2017  \\nTable 1.6: Total and Sectoral Employment Elasticities of Growth  \\nSector  2000 -2010 (%)  2010 -2017 (%)  \\nGrowth of agriculture  3.5 3.4 \\nGrowth of agricultural employment  2.65 (-0.57)  \\nAgriculture employment elasticity  0.76 Negative  \\nGrowth of manufacturing  7.5 10.3 \\nGrowth of manufacturing employment  6.2 4.0 \\nManufacturing employment elasticity  0.83 0.39 \\nGrowth of construction, mining, electricity and water  7.5 11.1 \\nGrowth of construction, mining, electricity and water employment  9.1 4.5 \\nConstruction, mining, electricity and water employment elasticity \\neeelasticityelasticity  1.21 0.41 \\nGrowth of services  6.3 6.0 \\nGrowth of services emp loyment  2.9 3.3 \\nServices employment elasticity  0.46 0.55 \\nGrowth of GDP  5.8 6.8 \\nGrowth of employment  3.3 1.7 \\nGDP employment elasticity  0.57 0.25 \\nSource: BBS national accounts and labour force surveys  \\n  8 \\n Several factors have contributed to this slowdown i n job creation, the most important of which is the \\nenterprise consolidation and automation in the Ready -made Garments (RMG) Sector that created some 4 \\nmillion jobs between 1990 and 2012, mostly for young women. The consolidation of the RMG sector owing \\nto automation, compliance with safety and other buyer -induced regulations, and scale economies has \\nresulted in a noticeable reduction in the number of RMG enterprises since 2012, which are mostly small -\\nscale in nature and are intensive in low -skill female -oriented employment (Figure 1.2). This has caused a \\nvirtual stagnation in RMG total employment at 4.0 million since FY2012 despite rapid growth in RMG \\nproduction and exports (Figure 1.3). This development has had a large negative effect on manufacturing \\njob c reation, especially for urban female youth. Many of the functions performed by these female youth \\nworkers are now fully automated.  \\nFigure 1.2: Number of RMG Factories  \\n \\n  Source: BGMEA  \\nFigure 1.3: RMG Employment (million workers)  \\n \\n            Source: BGM EA \\nSecond, the success in the RMG sector that created an export -oriented labor -intensive manufacturing sector \\nindustry has not been repeated elsewhere in the export sector for a range of reasons including the anti -\\nexport bias of the trade policy. Thus, des pite the dismantling of many trade restrictions, there is still \\nconsiderable trade protection that favors production for domestic markets. While domestic production and \\nvalue -added have grown, the employment effects of this import -substituting manufacturin g have been modest.   \\n01000200030004000500060007000\\n1984-85\\n1985-86\\n1986-87\\n1987-88\\n1988-89\\n1989-90\\n1990-91\\n1991-92\\n1992-93\\n1993-94\\n1994-95\\n1995-96\\n1996-97\\n1997-98\\n1998-99\\n1999-00\\n2000-01\\n2001-02\\n2002-03\\n2003-04\\n2004-05\\n2005-06\\n2006-07\\n2007-08\\n2008-09\\n2009-10\\n2010-11\\n2011-12\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16\\n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5\\n1984-85\\n1985-86\\n1986-87\\n1987-88\\n1988-89\\n1989-90\\n1990-91\\n1991-92\\n1992-93\\n1993-94\\n1994-95\\n1995-96\\n1996-97\\n1997-98\\n1998-99\\n1999-00\\n2000-01\\n2001-02\\n2002-03\\n2003-04\\n2004-05\\n2005-06\\n2006-07\\n2007-08\\n2008-09\\n2009-10\\n2010-11\\n2011-12\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16 9 \\n Third, the micro and small enterprises (MSEs)  are the backbone for non -farm job creation in Bangladesh. \\nAccording to the 2013 Census, some 99 per cent of all no n-farm enterprises fall in the MSE  categories and \\nthey provided employment to 20.3 million people in 2013. This makes them the largest source of \\nemployment outside agriculture (Figure 1.4). This sector is mostly informal in nature and lacks dynamism \\nowing to a variety of constraints including financing.  Non -farm job creation eco nomy wide will benefit \\nmost by strengthening this sector.  \\nFigure 1.4: Distribution of Employment 2013 (percentage)  \\n \\n                    Source:  BBS, LF S 2013 and Economic Census 2013  \\nOn the qualitative side of employment, the emp loyment structure did improve along the lines envisaged in \\nthe 7FYP. The share of low -productivity, low -income agriculture employment in total employment fell \\nsubstantially to 38%, down from 44% in 2015 (Table 1.4). The share of higher -productivity, higher -income \\nemployment grew in manufacturing and other industrial activities. The employment shares of services \\nsector grew rapidly. These are all good news, but the pace of transformation of employment sources was \\nlower than expected in the 7FYP owing to the sharp slowdown in the ability of the manufacturing sector to \\ncreate jobs despite rapid growth in production and value -added.        \\nLabour productivity : It is well understood that productivity increases are the only sustainable means to \\nincrease labour inc ome. Accordingly, a major objective of the 7FYP was to increase average labour \\nproductivity, economy wide and especially in agriculture. The changes in average labour productivity are \\nindicated in Figure 1.5, which shows that the average national labour pr oductivity grew by a healthy 5.6% \\nper year. Importantly, average labour productivity increased in all sectors including agriculture, where it is \\nestimated to have increased by a record 7.3% per year. Productivity grew fastest in manufacturing, rising \\nat a hefty pace of 9% per year. While this is great news for competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, \\nthe associated slowdown in the rate of growth of manufacturing employment raises an important policy \\nquestion of whether there is a trade -off between emplo yment and productivity growth and how these two \\nneed to be reconciled. This will need to be addressed in the 8FYP. The relative stagnation in service \\nproductivity is the consequence of large migration from agriculture and the rural economy in informal urba n \\nservices, particularly in the category of personal services and trading.  Disaggregated labour force data \\nshow that productivity and earnings are the highest in professional and formal services in banking, ICT, \\nmodern transport, health and education.   \\n0.010.020.030.040.050.0\\nAgriculture Non-Farm MSEs Other Non-Farm45.1\\n34.9\\n20.0 10 \\n Figure 1.5: Growth in Labour Productivity during the 7th Plan  \\n(000 taka 2005 -06 prices)  \\n            \\n                      Source: BBS national accounts and LFS data various years  \\nOverseas labour migration:  As noted, promotion of overseas labour migration,  especially to the oil -rich \\nMiddle Eastern Countries, was an important element of the 7FYP employment strategy.  Unlike domestic \\njob creation, the progress on this count was much better. Actual outflow of migrant labour substantially \\nexceeded the target in  the 7FYP (Table 1.3). Thus, as compared with the planned annual average migrant \\nlabour outflow of 0.4 million, actual outflow was 0.7 million.  This extra external employment provided a \\nbig cushion and softened the adverse effects of a slowdown in domesti c job creation. The government \\nsupported outward migration with a number of policy support including making better information available \\nto potential migrants, supporting the inflow of remittances through better banking services and special \\nexchange rate i ncentives, reducing the cost of migration by providing protection against exploitation by \\nmiddle -men and establishment of the Probashi Kalyan Bank to provide low -cost loan options, and providing \\nbetter training opportunities.  \\nProgress with youth employment : Despite several initiatives including the adoption of the National Youth \\nPolicy 2017, awareness building and training, the youth employment progress during 7FYP fell below \\nexpectations  (Table 1.7). The percentage of youth unemployment increased from 8% i n 2013 to 10.6% in \\n2017. The unemployment problem of educated youth also accentuated considerably along with a growing \\nincidence of the NEET youth population. The increase in NEET is a part of the reason for the slowdown in \\nlabour force growth during the 7 FYP. Addressing the youth employment comprehensively will be a major \\nchallenge for the 8FYP.  \\nTable 1.7: Progress with the Youth Employment Challenge during the 7FYP  \\nIndicator  LFS 2013  LFS 2017  \\nYouth Population as percent of total population  26.6 27.0 \\nYouth Labour Force as percent of total labour force  38.5 32.0 \\nYouth unemployment rate (%)  8.1 10.6 \\nHigher secondary educated youth unemployment rate (%)  13.6 22.3 \\nTertiary educated youth unemployment rate (%   16.4 13.4 \\nYouth not in Employment, Education o r Training (NEET) (%)  25.4 29.8 \\nSource: LFS 2013 and LFS 2016 -17 \\n141\\n49186214\\n175\\n65263\\n215\\n050100150200250300\\ntotal agriculture Manufacturing ServicesFY2015 FY2019 11 \\n 1.3 PROGRESS WITH REDUCING POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY  \\n1.3.1  Poverty Reduction  \\nThe 7FYP sought to reduce e poverty from 24.8% in 2015 to 16.6% and extreme poverty from 12.9% to \\n8.0% over the s ame periods. The estimated poverty reduction outcomes are shown in Table 1.8. The last \\nregular HIES was done in 2016 -17. The BBS has used the HIES data to estimate poverty reduction up to \\nFY2018.  For FY2019, Table 1.8 uses the poverty elasticity with resp ect to per capita GDP over the 2010 -\\n2016 periods. The results suggest that the actual poverty reduction may be fairly close to the 7FYP targets \\n(Table 1.9). So, in the absence of COVID -19 pandemic, the poverty reduction targets of the 7FYP would \\nhave been substantially achieved. This is an important result and speaks to the robustness of the poverty \\nstrategy in a pre - COVID -19 world. However, moving forward, the poverty reduction strategy may need to \\nbe modified to achieve the poverty reduction goals of the  SDG 01 and the Perspective Plan 2041 in a post -\\nCOVID -19 environment. This is discussed further in chapters 2 and 4 of part 1 and chapter 13 of Part 2.  \\nTable 1.8: Poverty Reduction during the Seventh Plan Period (%)  \\nYear  Poor (Head Count Poverty with  \\nUpper Poverty Line (%))  Extreme Poor (Head Count with Lower \\nPoverty Line (%))  \\n2016        24.3     12.9 \\n2017  22.9 12.1 \\n2018  21.8 11.3 \\n2019  20.5 10.5 \\n Source: BBS and GED estimates based on 2010 -2016 GDP -Poverty Relationship  \\nThe 7FYP poverty reduction stra tegy consisted of efforts to accelerate growth, increase domestic and \\nforeign employment, improve the pro -poor nature of growth through emphasis on agriculture, micro -credits \\nand public spending on rural infrastructure, and public spending on social protec tion. Some of the important \\npolicy  indicators for poverty reduction are summarized in Table 1.9.  \\nTable 1.9: Major Determinants of Poverty in the 7FYP  \\nPerformance Indicators  Baseline \\n(2015)  7FYP Target  \\n2020  Estimated \\n2019  \\nPoverty headcount (%)  24.8 18.6 20.5 \\nExtreme poverty (%)  12.9 8.9 10.5 \\nAverage growth of GDP (%)  6.6 7.4 7.5 \\nRate of growth of agricultural GDP (%)  3.3 3.3 3.5  \\nAgricultural diversification (share of non -crop %)  44.91  52.70  48.13  \\nExpansion of domestic annual employment (million)   \\n 2.2 1.1 \\nExpansion of annual overseas employment (million)   0.4 0.7 \\nAverage annual spending on social protection excluding civil \\nservice (% of GDP)  1.5 1.5 1.2 \\nSource: Seventh Five Year Plan; BBS.  \\n   12 \\n Growth of GDP: GDP growth continues to be the most impor tant determinant of poverty reduction in \\nBangladesh. So, the acceleration of GDP growth helped lower poverty substantially. Additionally, the \\ncontinued emphasis on agriculture sector with policy efforts to improve productivity and diversification \\nyielded c onsiderable success that helped improve farm incomes.  However, one important point to note is \\nthat when the Seventh Plan was adopted the latest HIES data was available for only 2010. The poverty \\nprojections were made on the basis of estimated poverty elas ticity of growth between 2005 and 2010. The \\nlatest HIES done in 2016 showed that actual poverty elasticities fell between 2010 and 2016 (Table 1.10). \\nThe fall in the poverty elasticity of growth is an indication that as poverty falls, reaching out the poor  \\nthrough growth efforts alone would not be enough. Other policies aimed at increasing the pro -poor nature \\nof growth and income transfers through social protection spending will need to be strengthened.   \\nTable 1.10: Poverty Elasticity of GDP Growth (%)  \\nPoverty Type  HIES Year  Poverty Elasticity  \\nPoverty  2005 -2010  0.8 \\nExtreme Poverty  2005 -2010  1.1 \\nPoverty  2010 -2016  0.7 \\nExtreme Poverty  2010 -2016  0.8 \\nSource: GED estimates based on HIES and national accounts data  \\nGrowth in employment, labour productivit y and real wages:  The pro -poor nature of growth depends to a \\nlarge extent on three important factors: growth in employment; improvement in labour productivity and \\nincrease in real wages. Table 1.4 showed a substantial shortfall in domestic job creation tar get in the 7FYP  \\nmainly owing to the slowdown in the growth of manufacturing employment. The employment stagnation \\nof the RMG sector particularly hurt the absorption of low -skilled female workers that contributed to the \\nlowering of the poverty elasticity of  growth. However, the substantial increase in labour productivity is a \\npositive factor.  \\nTable 1.11 shows the growth in real wages by the six major Divisions using HIES data. The results suggest \\nthat consistent  with rising labour productivity (Figure1.5) a nd a tightening of the agricultural labour market \\n(Table 1.6), real wages in agriculture increased substantially for all Divisions. Real wages also increased in \\nnon-farm employment. This increase in real wages is an important contributor to the decline in rural and \\nurban poverty.  \\nTable 1.11: Real Wage Growth between 2010 -2016  \\nDivisions  Rural/Agric\\nulture  Urban/Agric\\nulture  Rural/ Non -\\nAgriculture  Urban/Non -\\nAgriculture  Rural  Urban  \\nBarisal  7.0 7.4 7.0 7.0 6.9 7.0 \\nChittagong  4.0 4.2 6.1 6.7 5.0 6.8 \\nDhaka  6.8 6.8 6.0 8.9 6.0 8.9 \\nKhulna  6.8 4.0 8.7 7.4 7.7 7.3 \\nRajshahi  5.7 6.2 8.1 5.4 6.7 5.9 \\nSylhet  5.4 8.0 11.4 5.4 8.6 6.4 \\nBangladesh  5.9 6.8 7.5 4.1 6.5 7.7 \\nSource: Background Paper on Extreme Poverty prepared for 8FYP   13 \\n Remittances:  As noted in Table  1.4, th e outflow of migrant workers substantially exceeded 7FYP target. \\nEvidence also shows there was a qualitative improvement in the skill profile of migrant workers. In FY2019, \\nthe government also offered a special incentive of 2% higher exchange rate to shore  up external remittances. \\nThe net result of these developments was a substantial surge in the inflow of remittances since FY2018 \\n(Table 1.12).  \\nTable 1.12: Remittance Performance during the 7FYP  \\nFiscal Year  Number of Workers (000)  Remittance Inflow ($ bill ion) \\nFY2016  758 14.93  \\nFY2017  598 12.77  \\nFY2018  880 14.98  \\nFY2019  675 16.42  \\nFY2020   18.21  \\nSource: Bangladesh Bank  \\nSeveral research investigations have indicated the highly positive impact of remittances on poverty \\nreduction. Remittances have lowered pov erty through several channels. First, the migration of rural workers \\nto international work places is one important factor for the tightening of rural labour market, thereby \\nenabling the growth of real wages. Second, income transfers from remittances have d irectly supported \\npoverty reduction by increasing the income and consumption of the rural poor. Thirdly, and very \\nimportantly, the massive inflow of remittance income into the rural economy has boosted the expansion of \\nhousing, construction, trade and othe r services.  These in turn have provided a diversified employment base \\nfor rural workers. The multiplier effects of remittance inflows are a major contributor to rural \\ntransformation and diversified employment and income base for the rural poor.  \\nExpansion  of microcredit:  Bangladesh is justly famous globally for pioneering the growth of the \\nmicrocredit. These programmes have continued to improve access and services during the Seventh Plan. \\nThe Bangladesh Bank has taken a strong pro -active role to improve th e access of credit and other financial \\nservices. New financial instruments based on ICT (mobile banking) are slowly changing the landscape of \\nfinancial service access to the poor in both rural and urban areas. In the area of micro -credit, rules were \\ndevelo ped by the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) in 2010 to properly supervise MFIs and protect \\nboth the borrowers and the lenders. The number of borrowers increased from 20.4 million in FY2015 to \\n25.76 million in FY2019, while total loans increased from Taka 634 billion to Taka 1335 billion over the \\nsame periods.  \\n1.3.2  Income Inequality  \\nBangladesh has made solid progress in increasing GDP growth and reducing poverty.  Nevertheless, an \\nimportant policy challenge that has emerged concerns income inequality .  Evidence suggests that income \\ninequality has been increasing over the years. Accordingly, the Seventh Plan emphasized the reduction of \\nincome inequality as an important development objective and incorporated specific income inequality \\nreduction targets in the Development Results Framework (DRF). Specifically, the DRF sought to reduce \\nthe Gini coefficient of consumption to 0.30 in FY2020 from 0.32 in FY2010 and to contain the Gini \\ncoefficient for income inequality at 0.46. The 7FYP strategy to tackle inco me inequality included reform \\nof public spending with greater emphasis on health, education, agriculture, rural development; increasing  14 \\n pro-poor growth through increase in employment, labour productivity and wages, the development of \\nhuman capital with bet ter access to poor, the expansion of micro -credits and loans to improve the access of \\nthe poor to growth,  reform of taxes with emphasis on progressive personal income taxation and improved \\naccess of the poor to social protection programmes.  \\nThe latest av ailable HIES data for 2016 shows that the Gini coefficient of consumption has remain \\nunchanged at around 0.32 as in 2010, while the Gini coefficient of income has increased from 0.46 to 0.48. \\nBut data for 2019 is not available. So, in the absence of curren t data, it is difficult to say conclusively about \\noverall progress with reducing income inequality during the 7FYP. However, some qualitative assessment \\ncan be made. On the positive side, the strong growth in agriculture and the diversification of farm \\nproduction to higher value non -food crop is the most promising factor for improving income distribution. \\nA second positive factor is the expansion of credit to small borrowers through the microcredit schemes. A \\nthird positive factor is the increase in real wa ges. A fourth positive factor is the growth of non -farm rural \\nemployment opportunities. However, the implementation of other policy interventions has been less \\neffective. The reform of income taxation into a modern system that taxes all income at progressi ve rates \\ndid not happen. Expenditure policies are broadly on the track but the planned expansion in public \\nexpenditure as a percent of GDP on health, education, rural development and social protection has not \\nhappened owing to tax revenue shortfalls. The d istribution of benefits of social protection suffers from \\nconsiderable mis -targetting leaving a lot of poor out, while including considerable percentage of non -poor. \\nSo, on balance, income inequality remains a major challenge for Bangladesh. The Eighth Pla n will need to \\ntake a fresh endeavour and provide renewed commitment to reversing the pattern of long -term increase in \\nincome inequality in Bangladesh.  \\n1.4 WOMEN EMPOWERMENT, SOCIAL INCLUSION AND SOCIAL PROTECTION  \\n1.4.1  Gender Equality  \\nBangladesh has earned i nternational recognition for its good performance in increasing women \\nempowerment. This progress continued during the 7FYP. Having eliminated the gender disparity in primary \\nand secondary education, solid progress has been made in reducing the large gap be tween male and female \\nstudents at the tertiary level. Bangladesh has also advanced well in providing the regulatory framework for \\nprotection of women’s rights and privileges. The implementation of the National Women Development \\nPolicy (NWDP) 2011 has conti nued during the 7FYP. Data from LFS 2016 -17 shows that progress has \\nbeen made in increasing the share of female in managerial and professional leadership roles. Political \\nempowerment has been boosted through increased membership in the national parliament.    \\nThe 2020 Global Gender Gap Report published by World Economic Forum, records the solid progress \\nmade by Bangladesh in reducing the gender gap. The Global Gender Gap Report (GGGR) ranks countries \\nbased on their progress towards closing the gender gap acr oss four thematic dimensions: (i) Economic \\nparticipation and opportunity, (ii) Educational attainment, (iii) Health and survival, and (iv) Political \\nempowerment. With an overall score of 0.726 Bangladesh was ranked at 50th among 153 countries, ahead \\nof adv anced countries like the USA, Luxembourg, Italy, Korea and Japan and was ranked first among seven \\nSouth Asian countries.  The areas of strength include eliminating gender gap in eliminating primary and \\nsecondary education (rank of 1); in sex ratio at birth  (rank of 1); and political empowerment (rank of 1).   15 \\n Notwithstanding this solid progress, there are several areas that need greater attention during the 8FYP.  \\nThe GGR shows that the Bangladesh ranking is low in the area of economic participation and oppo rtunity. \\nThis concern: low female labour force participation rate, wage discrimination against women, inadequate \\nrepresentation of women in senior civil service positions and inadequate female managerial jobs in the \\nprivate sector. In social empowerment, l aws are adequate but implementation is weak. Stronger \\nimplementation of CEDAW and other gender related laws to prevent child marriage, prevent social violence \\nand eliminate all discriminations against female in social and economic spheres remains a major c hallenge.   \\n1.4.2  Social Inclusion  \\nBangladesh takes pride in establishing a social system where there is no legal barrier to progress based on \\nreligion, gender, caste and profession. Special attention is also given to ensure the protection of children, \\nelderly and the physically challenged. The 7FYP put strong emphasis on ensuring continued progress with \\nthe social inclusion agenda. Available evidence suggests that the Seventh Plan’s social inclusion strategy \\nimplementation is broadly on track. Good progre ss has been made in the area of child protection. The \\nimplementation of the Children Act of 2013 is ongoing, need a costed action plan and allocation of resources \\naccordingly. The concept of Child Focused Budget has been introduced and is being implemented . Child \\nFocused Budget gradually need increasing allocation for effective coverage. The incidence of child \\nmalnutrition has reduced significantly. However, progress in the area of children nutrition requires \\nadditional effort. The incidence of child povert y is high and the implementation of the consolidated Child \\nBenefits Program recommended by the NSSS needs to be fast -tracked. Implementation capacity for \\nenforcement of the Children Act 2013 also needs strengthening and need deployment of dedicated social \\nservice workforce for children including children with disabilities.  Data on children living on street and \\nliving in orphanages or institutional care facilities are lacking in the country. Deinstitutionalization of \\nchildren living in institutions or orpha nages and family or community based reintegration through \\ndeveloping a foster care mechanism with cash grant will be effective to protect more children in terms of \\nincreasing capacity for social integration and cognitive development. Community Based Organi zations of \\nPersons with Disabilities and network of persons with disabilities need more support to create opportunity \\nfor them to speak about the issues affecting their life. These issues will be tackled more forcefully in the 8FYP.  \\nRegarding Ethnic popula tion, the 7FYP has continued the focus on reducing the growth barriers in the \\nChittagong Hill Tracts Area (CHTA). Several development schemes to strengthen agriculture, water \\nmanagement, infrastructure and to improve access to health and education have bee n implemented. The \\ngovernment maintains a regular consultation with the CHTA local population with a view to understanding \\ntheir concerns and fnding solutions. The development needs of CHTA are large in relation to available \\nresources and continued strong efforts will be needed to reduce the high incidence of poverty found in \\nCHTA districts.    \\nBangladesh made strong progress in the 6FYP in terms of eliminating legal barriers and introducing \\nenabling environment to improve the welfare of persons with disabi lity (PWD). Of particular note is the \\nratification of the Disabled Persons Protection and Rights Act in 2013.  Among other things, the Act bans \\neducational institutions, enterprises and other organizations from discriminating against PWD. The main \\ntask of the 7FYP was to implement these regulations and the enabling environment for supporting the PWD. \\nBased on the findings of the 2012 Disability Detecion Survey, the government developed special \\nprogrammes in health and education to meet the specific needs of  the PWD. The National Social Security  16 \\n Strategy (NSSS) recommended the establishment of a comprehensive social protection programme for \\npeople with disability. While some progress has been made in the programme design, the new social \\nprotection programme f or PWD is not yet ready. In the meanwhile, implementation of the current safety \\nnet programme for PWD has continued. The number of beneficiaries more than quadrupled between 2015 \\nand 2019, increasing from 0.4 million to 1.7 million. The value of the disabi lity benefit is Taka 700 per \\nmonth. There are some programmes for skill development. A disability information system has also been \\nestablished under the Department of Social Services.  \\nFinally, the 7FYP social inclusion strategy for marginalized groups such  as the Dalits and Sex Workers was \\nto eliminate all discrimination, protect them from social abusive practices and offer special programmes \\nthrough the NSSS. The legal provisions are in place but implementation is a challenge given limited \\ncapacities at th e local level. Safety net programmes have made some progress but full inclusion of these \\nmarginalized groups in the social protection programme remains a challenge. Overall, the successful \\nimplementation of an overarching social inclusion strategy as envis aged in the Constitution requires the \\ninstitution of strong local government institutions.   \\n1.4.3  Social Protection  \\nBangladesh has a rich history of commitment to social protection. In June 2015 the Government adopted a \\nnew National Social Security Strate gy (NSSS) with a view to strengthening the poverty impact of the public \\nspending on social protection and to modernize the social security system to address the social security \\nchallenges of a middle - income economy. The main task for the 7FYP was to imple ment the NSSS. \\nAvailable evidence suggests the implementation of the NSSS in the first 5 years (FY 2016 -FY2020) since \\nadoption in June 2015 has been slow. There was a long delay with start -up of the NSSS implementation \\nand monitoring. Subsequently, with th e assistance of development partners, a formal NSSS Implementation \\nAction Plan was adopted in 2018. This Action Plan is comprehensive and if these actions are implemented \\nwell it should help considerably in making progress with NSSS despite the time lost.  \\nA recent review of the implementation of the NSSS and the NSSS Action Plan shows that while progress \\nhas been made in a number of areas, the overall progress is modest and needs to be consolidated in the \\n8FYP.  Evaluation results of individual programmes continue to show high exclusion and inclusion errors \\nand continued leakages partly because of the pitfalls of poverty targeted approaches. Additionally, the \\nslowdown in tax revenues has contributed to a resource constraint despite strong priority attached to social \\nprotection. Excluding civil service pensions, total social protection funding for the poor and vulnerable is \\nonly 1.2% of GDP. This is not adequate for a country with 40 million poor and another 20 million who are \\nnear poor (1.25 times the povert y line). The COVID -19 has further accentuated the urgency of strengthening \\nthe social protection programmes and funding. The 8FYP will make this a top priority both as an important \\ninstrument to address the effects of COVID -19 on poverty and vulnurability and to increase the growth \\nelasticity of poverty reduction.  \\n1.5 PROGRESS WITH MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT  \\nPrudent macroeconomic management has been the hallmark of Bangladesh’s long -term development. The \\n7FYP maintained this tradition and put considerable emphasi s on the need to preserve macroeconomic \\nstability while pursuing aggressively the growth agenda. The Seventh Plan was cognizant that there was no  17 \\n conflict between macroeconomic stability and growth acceleration. So, the underlying theme of \\nmacroeconomic po licy management was growth acceleration with macroeconomic stability. The key \\nmacroeconomic targets of the 7FYP and actual performance are indicated in Table 1.13.  Good progress \\nwas made in maintaining macroeconomic stability reflected in low inflation ra tes, low fiscal deficits, low \\ndebt-to-GDP ratio and a stable balance of payments.  But progress in the area of fiscal revenues mobilization \\nand achieving the export targets of the 7FYP was weak.  \\nTable 1.13: Key Targets of the 7FYP Macroeconomic Framework  \\nPolicy Area  Performance Indicator  Baseline \\n(FY2015)  Plan \\n(FY2020)  Actual \\n(FY2020)  \\nFiscal Policy  Tax to GDP ratio (%)  8.5 \\n 14.1 7.9 \\nPublic expenditure to GDP ratio (%)  13.5 21.1 14.9 \\nFiscal Deficit (% of GDP)  3.7 4.7 \\n 5.5 \\nTotal Debt (% of GDP)  33.6 36.3 35.98  \\nBalance of  \\nPayments  Average growth rate of exports (nominal US$) (%)  \\n - \\n \\n \\n 12.0 \\n 1.6 \\nExports (% of GDP)  15.7 16.2 12.32  \\nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  1.5 (-) 2.5 (-) 1.24  \\nRemittance (% of GDP)  7.8 7.6 5.6 \\nForeign Reserves (month of imports)  6.3 7.3 7.2 \\nExternal Debt (% of GDP)  12.3 11.2 13.4 \\nMonetary \\nPolicy  Rate of CPI inflation (%)  6.5 \\n 5.5 \\n 5.65 \\nGrowth of M2 (%) (end of year)  12.4 15.9 12.64  \\nGrowth of Private Sector Credit  13.2 15.0 13.14  \\nSource: Seventh Plan and Finance Di vision (FD) Estimates.    Note: Growth rates are period averages  \\n1.5.1  Fiscal Management  \\nFiscal policy performance during the 7FYP has been mixed. The performance is on track regarding fiscal \\nprudence. The budget deficit has been at 5.5% of GDP and total d ebt to GDP ratio is lower than the Plan \\ntarget. This is a strong fiscal performance from the point of view of macroeconomic stability, which has \\nsupported private investment by avoiding a crowding out impact of fiscal policy and has helped the \\nimplementati on of monetary policy in fighting inflation. However, there are major concerns in other \\ndimensions of fiscal policy management.   \\nFirst, there is a major shortfall in tax performance. Compared with the Seventh Plan target of increasing tax \\nto GDP ratio by 5.4 percentage points to 14.1% of GDP by FY2020, the actual tax to GDP ratio reached \\nonly to 7.9% of GDP in FY 2020. This is a serious setback following on the heels of a lack -lustre tax \\nperformance during the 6FYP.   \\nSecond, fiscal discipline has often re quired either cutbacks or inability to meet the Seventh Plan \\ncommitments in certain high priority areas of spending (e.g. in education, health, social protection and \\nenvironment). The revenue constraint in public spending has been very deep as reflected by  the fact that as \\ncompared with a spending target of 21% of GDP for FY2020 in the 7FYP, actual public expenditure was \\nonly 14.9% in FY2020. This massive 5 -6% of GDP shortfall in public spending over the 7FYP has \\nessentially converted into allocation shortf alls in health, education, water resources, environment and  18 \\n climate change, social protection and O&M spending. The reduction in the poverty elasticity of GDP \\ngrowth is in part a reflection of this inability of fiscal policy to fully support core poverty r eduction \\nprogrammes owing to revenue constraints.    \\nThird, implementation constraints have slowed down the progress with the timely completion of major \\ninfrastructure projects. The delays in the completion of major infrastructure projects have resulted in  cost \\nover-runs and delayed benefits, thereby lowering the financial and economic rate of return of these major \\ndevelopment projects.  \\nFourth, the important policy initiative of public -private -partnership in infrastructure did not gain adequate \\nmomentum.   \\nThe Government is cognizant that these major weaknesses in fiscal policy management on both the revenue \\nand expenditure sides have continued for a long period and these will need to be tackled forcefully in the \\n8FYP.   \\nMore investment for children will be priority of the Government during 8FYP. Following strategic actions \\nwill be undertaken: (a) evidences are generated to advocate for greater and better public investments for \\nchildren by way of analysing child focused budgeting including preparation of budg et brief, pursuing fiscal \\nspace analysis including institutional investment plans for children, p ursuing public expenditure review for \\nchildren, pursuing c ost benefit analysis of selected interventions for children, (b) c capacity of duty bearers \\nenhanced i n child focused budgeting process, (c) involvement of citizen (including children) to empower \\nthem to participate in budgeting process to improve transparency and accountability .  \\n1.5.2  External Sector Management  \\nThe performance of the Seventh Plan in the external sector is generally strong in terms of maintaining \\nexternal stability. The current account has been either in surplus or experienced low levels of deficits, the \\nexternal debt service and external debt to GDP are both low and are at sustainable lev els with no pressure \\non debt repayments. Remittance inflows faced challenges in the early years of the 7FYP but then recovered \\nand are now on a strong footing. Reserves level are comfortable and the nominal exchange rate has been \\nstable. Importantly, forei gn exchange reserves exhibit a record bench mark and reached at US$ 36.04 billion \\nin June, 2020 which is sufficient to pay import bill of 7.8 months.     \\nAs against these positive aspects, there are two areas of concern. First, the rate of growth of export s fell \\nmuch short of the Seventh Plan target. The Plan aimed at securing an annual average growth in export \\nearnings of 12% in nominal US Dollars. The actual growth was only 6.8%. This is a rather weak export \\nperformance. The sharp slowdown of exports is a n important reason for the slowdown in the expansion of \\nthe manufacturing sector job. A second concern is the inability to broaden and diversify the export base \\naway from excessive reliance on readymade garments (RMG). On the contrary, the share of RMG exp orts \\nhas increased further, growing from 78% of total exports in FY2015 to 84% in FY2019. Non -RMG exports \\ndid not pick up in any significant way. Additionally, non -factor service exports like ICT, shipping and \\ntourism have also not shown dynamism. The dive rsification of sources of export earnings will be a major \\nchallenge for the Eighth Plan.   19 \\n 1.5.3  Inflation Management  \\nA major macroeconomic policy priority of the Seventh Plan was to keep inflation under control and bring \\nthe inflation rate below 6%. More s pecifically, the target was to reduce the average inflation rate from 6.5% \\npercent in FY2015 to 5.5% by the end of the plan period. The trend in inflation in the Seventh Plan is shown \\nin Figure 1.6. Remarkably, the 7FYP has been very successful in implemen ting the inflation target set in \\nthe Plan. Monetary and fiscal prudence allowed domestic liquidity to be managed well that enabled the \\ncontainment of inflation and bringing it down to 5.5% FY2019. The private sector credit growth, however, \\nfell substantial ly short of the Plan target. But this was not due to any crowding out effects of fiscal policy \\nor monetary policy tightening. There was a demand constraint that lowered the growth of private credit \\nowing to slowdown of growth of exports and the lower expan sion of the private investment rate than was \\ntargeted in the Seventh Plan.   \\nFigure 1.6: Trend of Inflation during the Seventh Plan (%)  \\n \\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\n1.6 PROGRESS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  \\n1.6.1  Power and Primary Energy  \\nIn the area of electricity, the Government followed up on its strong progress with increase in power supply \\nand access to electricity during the 6FYP with another round of a strong and well -rounded reform \\nprogramme to increase the supply of electricity inv olving substantial investment, sector reforms and \\nregional trade during the 7FYP. The Government, which had been implementing the power sector \\nprogrammes based on the Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010 during the 6th Plan, revised it to PSMP \\n2016, to hel p adapt to changing scenarios during the 7FYP. A review of progress suggests that the DRF \\ntargets set forth under the 7FYP have broadly been achieved. At present, Bangladesh has generation \\ncapacity well above the demand. This growth in generation capacity along with expansion of transmission \\nand distribution networks have helped achieve substantial progress in both the indicators for the power \\nsector: increasing growth of per capita consumption of electricity and improving the access of the \\npopulation to el ectricity.    6.41\\n5.92\\n5.445.78\\n5.47\\n4.85.05.25.45.65.86.06.26.46.6\\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 20 \\n In FY 2019 total installed capacity, inclusive of public, IPP, captive and renewable energy reached 22, 787 \\nMW higher than the target. Electricity coverage has been increased to 92.23%, which was 72% in the \\nbaseline FY2015. This has resulted in increasing per capita generation of 510 kwh (including captive) from \\n371 kWh in FY2015. During this period about 3.27 crore consumers got connected to the national grid with \\n5.02 lakh km. of distribution system. The system loss of electricity decreased substantially to 10.90 present \\nin FY2019 (up to December 2018) from 15.73 percent in FY2010. During the seventh plan period, progress \\nhas been made in diversifying primary energy source through LNG imports, and progress in construction \\nof large sized coal fired power plant. There have also been several price adjustments in all segments of the \\nenergy sector.   \\nDespite this progress there are two areas of concern. First, the use of renewable energy in power supply has \\nnot grown. Thus, the share of renewable e nergy to the total electricity generation (% including hydro) \\ndeclined from 3.6% in FY2015 to 3.25% in FY2019. This continued overwhelming reliance on fossil fuel \\nneeds to be reduced to keep pace with the progress made globally in the use of clean fuel. Se cond, despite \\nprice increases, progress with improving the energy sector finances has been limited . The 8FYP will put \\nstronger focus on these aspects of power and energy sector development.   \\n1.6.2  Transport Sector  \\nGDP growth targets of the 7FYP and goals of improved living standards called for a vibrant and effective \\ntransport network. Securing improvement in the transport system was, therefore, a major strategic objective of \\nthe 7FYP. The transport sector vision for the 7FYP was to develop an efficient, s ustainable, safe and \\nregionally balanced transportation system in which various modes complement each other, interface \\nappropriately and, where possible, provide healthy competition to each other. Special emphasis was placed \\non the i ntroduction of modern t echnology for increasing capacity and improving quality and productivity of \\nthe system, development of the two seaports with smooth transport links to Dhaka, establishment of effective \\nrailway linkages between the east and west zones of the country, integr ation of road, rail and inland water \\ntransport, and participation in global and regional transport connectivity initiatives that help develop the land \\nroute links between South Asia and East Asia through Bangladesh.  \\nOn the investment side, a conscious dec ision was taken to prioritize transformational transport infrastructure \\nprojects that helps modernize the Bangladesh transport network so as to improve the mobility of goods and \\nservices across the nation, facilitate international trade, reduce cost and im prove competitiveness. These \\ntransformational projects are highly capital intensive, are multi -year in nature, and require strong supervision \\nto avoid cost over -runs and delays. Recognizing the special challenge posed by growing urbanization and urban \\ntraffic congestion, the 7FYP sought to introduce mass transit starting with the capital city Dhaka, with a targeted \\ncompletion of MRT Line -6 (the first elevated Metro Rail of Bangladesh) in December 2021. Mindful of the \\nresource constraints and high investment  costs, the 7FYP strategy was to combine ADP allocations with a \\nstrong public -private -partnership (PPP) effort. The plan also intended to improve the inter -modal transport \\nbalance with greater emphasis on rail and inland waterways that are low -cost in natu re and are environmentally \\nfriendly. The importance of transport, especially air transport, for tourism was recognized with a focus on \\nimproving inter -district airline connectivity. Efforts were also to be made to improve resource mobilization \\nthrough the introduction of user charges and fees for a range of public transport services including road user \\ncharges, port fees, inland water and rail fares.   21 \\n The objectives and strategies of the 7FYP for the transport sector were sound. The emphasis on intermodal \\ntransport coordination, development of the national highways, inter -city connectivity, regional \\nconnectivity, lowering the cost of trade logistics and improving transport network asset maintenance are all \\nwell placed. The idea of instituting road user charge s and sensitivity to environmental sustainability is also \\nappropriate. Similarly, the strategy to improve incentives for private sector participation in both transport \\nsector service and infrastructure development is well placed.  \\nConsistent with the 7FYP s trategy, the transport sector received high priority in budget allocation. The \\nannual ADP allocated resources for all major projects in line with the 7FYP strategy and priority. \\nSignificant new transport infrastructure has been added over the plan period f or roads and bridges. Services \\nhave expanded for all modes of transport. Private participation in air transport has grown significantly and \\nmost large cities are now connected with air services.  These are major achievements that laid a strong \\nfoundation f or consolidation under the 8FYP.   \\nDespite progress, important gap remains. Notwithstanding the strong focus on transformational project and \\ntrying to complete them on time, important projects, such as the Padma Bridge, have been delayed. Many \\nroad project s were initiated but completion rates have been slow. Investments in inland water transport have \\nlagged behind. Notwithstanding the completion of a number of projects, the urban transport issues in terms \\nof congestion and traffic management remain overwhel ming in the capital city of Dhaka. Importantly, the \\nPPP initiative for infrastructure did not take off as expected.  \\nThe lessons of implementation of the Sixth and Seventh Plans suggest that the Government may need to \\nrethink strategy for to the implementa tion of the large, complex and capital -intensive projects through \\nturnkey contracts to reputed international firms using multilateral development partner funding of PPP \\ncontracts. These turnkey projects should be negotiated through a transparent ICB proces s and should \\ninvolve performance clause on timeliness and cost over -runs.  \\n1.7 PROGRESS WITH HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT  \\n1.7.1  Health, Population and Nutrition (HPN)  \\nThe Seventh Plan set ambitious targets for human development, as a way to ensure that the PP202 1 targets \\nare met. On the population health and nutrition side, it emphasized a further reduction in the rate of growth \\nof population, sought to increase life expectancy and improve child nutrition. On the education and training \\nfront, it sought to sharply  increase the literacy rates and basic education of the young and growing labour \\nforce that had low literacy and education skills. The human development targets sought to set up Bangladesh \\nto move to an upper -middle -income country.  \\nEvidence shows considera ble progress was made in the HPN area. The adoption of modern birth control \\npractices has continued to increase, and the total fertility rate has continued to decline. As a result, the \\npopulation growth rate has fallen further to around 1.2% and it is like ly that the 1% population growth rate \\ntarget for 7FYP will be achieved. The increase in life expectancy to 72 years in 2018, ahead of the target \\nof 70 years set for FY2021, suggests that basic health care and nutrition standards required for survival \\nhave exceeded the expectations of the policymakers. Infant mortality rate further declined to 21/1000, in \\nFY2019. Regarding maternal mortality rate, the progress up to 2019 is a reduction from 216/ 100,000 in  22 \\n FY2010 to 165/100,000. This reduction is low compare d to the target of 105/100,000 by FY2020, which \\nwill not be achieved.  The inadequate progress with tackling maternal mortality is a major weakness of an \\notherwise good HPN delivery system. This requires urgent policy action. Progress with improving child \\nnutrition is reflected in the reduction of wasting from 16% in 2011 to 9.8% in 2019. This is good progress \\nand is indicative of improved nutrition policy and governance adopted by the government during PP2021.  \\nHowever, in spite of the achievements, major inequities in health and nutrition services still exist and need \\nto be addressed. There are challenges in addressing mortality rates due to non -communicable diseases \\n(NCDs); reducing out -of-pocket expenditure; improving coverage and quality of essential nu trition \\nservices; improving facility readiness including establishment and strengthening Electronic Logistic \\nManagement Information system (E -LMIS); improving service quality and coverage; regulating and \\nmanaging the private sector; and quality of health c are. Public expenditure on HPN has remained virtually \\nstagnant at 0.7% of GDP for a fairly long time which need immediate attention to increase.  While it is \\ncredit to the government that it has achieved such positive HPN outcomes with a low public budget,  this \\nmay not be sustainable moving forward as the incidence of mass communicable diseases (cholera, malaria, \\nTB, polio) falls and low -cost preventive and curative solutions for these diseases are replaced by a more \\ncomplex and expensive pattern of epidemi ology found in higher -income countries. While private \\nexpenditure will be the main source of HPN expenses as the country moves up the income stream, public \\nspending on research and health insurance subsidies for the poor and the elderly will emerge as majo r \\nexpenditure items to enable HPN service access for the poor in both rural and urban areas.  Additionally, \\nintegration of Growth Monitoring and Promotion into EPI platform to increase quality and coverage on \\nnutrition services (which is also a MTR recomme ndation) and the whole system of health insurance is a big \\nmissing item in the Bangladesh HPN strategy that needs urgent attention.  \\nMost importantly, COVID -19 caught the health system completely unaware and unprepared.  While \\nCOVID -19 has challenged global ly some of the best health care systems in the world, the Bangladesh \\nexperience showed the lack of readiness in terms of basic facilities like PPEs, masks, oxygen supply, trained \\nhealth care professionals and health care beds and basic supplies.  This is p artly the outcome of low public \\nhealth spending, but also reflect institutional weaknesses relating to planning, regulations, and \\naccountability of health providers. The experience shows that the Bangladesh healthcare system was set up \\nto tackle simple bac terial type mass communicable diseases with low -cost solutions. Tackling the complex \\npandemic of COVID -19 requires large resources, strong planning and rapid response capabilities. It also \\ncalls for a substantial beefing up of health care facilities, suppl ies and quality staffing. Strengthening the \\nhealth care system of Bangladesh in the post -COVID -19 world is the top most development priority of the \\n8FYP.  \\n1.7.2  Education and Training  \\nOn the education and training front, the main highlight of the 7FYP strat egy is to achieve Education for All \\n(EFA) by FY2020.  Related to this, the two specific targets were: (1) achieve 100% adult (15 plus) literacy; \\n(2) achieve 100% net primary enrolment rate. Other objectives included increasing enrolments in secondary \\nand t ertiary education; improving education quality at all levels; improving the equity of education; \\nimproving labour force training and skills through a concerted skills development strategy; and increasing \\nthe spread of science and technology education.   23 \\n Bangladesh has continued to make progress in improving adult literacy rates, growing from 58.6% in \\nFY2010 to 73.9% in FY2018. Both male and female literacy rates have improved and the gap in female \\nliteracy rate over the male has continued to narrow. At the p resent trend rate, however, it is unlikely that \\n100% adult literacy rate will be achieved by FY2020.  Bangladesh has made good progress in primary level \\nenrolment and eliminated the gender gap. So, the target of universal primary education is substantially  \\nachieved. An important component of the government’s EFA is the coverage of non -formal education \\n(NFE). Progress with increasing the coverage of NFE continued under the 7FYP, but it is unlikely that NFE \\nwill achieve 100% coverage by FY2020. There are impo rtant institutional constraints that need to be \\naddressed to improve effectiveness.  \\nThe expansion of secondary and tertiary education continued steadily under the 7FYP. Net secondary \\nenrolment expanded from 46% in FY2010 to 67% in FY2017. Tertiary educatio n expanded from 11% to \\n18% over the same period. This good progress has been greatly facilitated by the government’s liberal \\npolicy to allow the private supply of education, especially tertiary education. This is a major policy success \\nfor the education po licy, particularly given the still low coverage of tertiary education and the financial \\nconstraint on the government budget. To further accelerate the expansion of tertiary education, the \\ngovernment in 2017 adopted the Strategic Plan for Higher Education i n Bangladesh: 2017 - 2031.  \\nFor labour training, the main strategy has been to strengthen the system of technical and vocational \\neducation and training (TVET). Formal TVET consists of SSC, HSC, and Diploma courses, HSC (VOC), \\nSSC (VOC) and HSC (BM). The pro grammes include time -bound, institution -based, and graded training \\nwith formal certification. The courses are offered by Engineering Colleges, Polytechnic Institutes, \\nTechnical School and Colleges (TSCs), Technical Teachers’ Training College (TTTC), Vocati onal \\nTeachers’ Training Institute (VTTI), Business Management Colleges and other technical and vocational \\ninstitutes. The enrolment rate in TVET increased from 1% in 2009 to 16.1% in 2018. The number of private \\nsector institutions is increasing, especially  in the ICT sector and in response to opportunity for work abroad \\nas skilled and semi -skilled workers in various trades.  \\nThe Government expressed its commitment to improving the TVET system through the implementation of \\nthe National Education policy -2010 and the National Skills Development Policy -2011. These policies \\nenvisaged the expansion, diversification, extension and development of technical and vocational education \\nprogrammes. Under the National Skills Development Policy, National Technical and Vocat ional \\nQualifications Framework (NTVQF) has been designed to improve the quality and consistency of nationally \\nrecognized qualifications. Another significant initiative is the Skills for Employment Investment Program \\n(SEIP) under the Ministry of Finance (fu nded by ADB and the government) which has partnered with a \\nnumber of industry associations such as BASIS, BTMA, BGMEA, AEOSIB and others to impart vocational \\ntraining with globally recognized skills certifications where appropriate. The Technical and Madra ssa \\nEducation Division (TMED) has developed an integrated TVET development action plan to promote and \\nstrengthen TVET activities for the madrassa students.  \\nThese policies have enabled a steady expansion in the number of graduates from the TVET system. A ma jor \\ngap, however, is the mismatch between skills available and the job market. Manufacturing firms and high -\\nend service enterprises continue to face a skill constraint and have resorted to hiring these skills from \\nabroad.   24 \\n Notwithstanding the greater empha sis on education and substantial progress, Bangladesh continues to face \\na number of challenges, pertaining to both quantity and quality. From a quantitative point of view, the issue \\nof access and drop out, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, are  major challenges. Even at the \\nprimary level, the dropout rate was 18.8% in FY2018. As for higher education, the issues of inadequate \\nfunding and the lack of infrastructure and capacity (both physical as well as other infrastructural) are very \\nimportant, w hich have limited the higher education enrolment rate to only 18% despite massive private \\ninvestment. At all stages of education, quality is a critical area of concern, which is particularly acute at the \\nprimary education level that then spills over to the  next stages of education.  \\nThe issue of quality in terms of cognitive skill and innovative and analytical capacity has become a matter \\nof concern as the students are often found to lack basic technical skills even after completion of tertiary \\nlevel of edu cation. Owing to this, university/college graduates often find it difficult to compete in the job \\nmarket. Additionally, lower student participation and low level of capacity at technical and vocational \\neducation along with a lesser focus on science and tec hnology have also contributed to a skill gap in the \\nemployment market. The skills demanded at the workplace are not always provided by the education and \\ntraining system. Resolving this skills gap will require careful and timely intervention.  \\nOne of the un derlying reasons behind the quantitative as well as qualitative challenges is the low budgetary \\nallocation for the education sector, fluctuating around 2% of GDP in recent years.  Despite government’s \\nintentions to increase allocation in the annual budget,  revenue constraints have prevented this to materialize \\nin practice. The low budget allocation is often considered as the most important constraint underlying the \\nweak quality of education and training in public institutions, thereby limiting the successfu l implementation \\nof the education and training strategies and policies.  \\nThere are also concerns about the equity of education spending and the remaining gender gaps.  From an \\nequity point of view, the gross enrolment rate for the poor at the secondary lev el is only 24%, which is \\nsignificantly lower than that of non -poor (76%). On the gender front, although there has been substantial \\nprogress in closing the gender gap at the primary and secondary levels, the picture is quite different when \\nit comes to terti ary education. One of the reasons for the low participation of females in the labour market \\nof Bangladesh (36.3% according to the FY2017 Labor Force Survey) and high concentration on low paying, \\nlow productive jobs is the low level of participation of fema les at tertiary level of education. Female students \\nat public and private universities on average account for only around 26% of university students.  \\n1.8 PROGRESS WITH ENVIRONMENT, CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISASTER \\nMANAGEMENT  \\n1.8.1  Environment and Climate Change  \\nThe Government has integrated environmental degradation and climate change in the medium -term \\nplanning process and identified specific objectives and strategies for environmental protection and climate \\nchange. The global attention to climate change and the ri sks presented to Bangladesh have caught the \\nimagination of the policymakers at the highest level and there is a much more serious effort now underway \\nto come to grips with this long -term challenge. Bangladesh participates actively in all global discussions  \\non climate change and is a signatory to all related global action programmes.   25 \\n Many laws and regulations have been enacted over the years to protect the environment and programmes \\nand policies are in place to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of clim ate change.  This progress \\ncontinued under the 7FYP, with special emphasis on air and water pollution control. In addition to the legal \\nframework, the focus on implementation was strengthened with significant progress in managing the air \\npollution from bri ck kilns and reducing water pollution from the leather industry. Important steps were also \\ntaken to improve biodiversity.  \\nAn important breakthrough on the strategy and policy front happened recently with the adoption of the \\nBangladesh Delta Plan 2100 in S eptember 2018. This is a comprehensive strategy for managing the risks \\nposed by the deltaic formation of the country along with the incidence of natural disasters and climate \\nchange. Speedy implementation of the Delta Plan will be a major input to the redu ction of climate -related \\nvulnerabilities and will vastly improve the prospects for sustained development and poverty reduction.  \\nWhen it comes to mitigation initiatives, Bangladesh has expressed her intention in the NDC ( Nationally \\nDetermined Contributions)  to take action on mitigation in order to reduce GHGs emissions by following a \\nlow carbon development pathway. The country has committed voluntarily to reduce 12 Mt CO 2 equivalent \\nin Power, Transport and Industry sectors by 2030 or 5% below business -as-usual (BAU) emission for those \\nsectors. It has also committed an additional 24 Mt CO 2 equivalent in those three sectors by 2030 or 10% \\nbelow BAU emissions if International support is received.  \\nBangladesh remains a forerunner in its adaptation endeavours. Ban gladesh has prepared a NAP Roadmap \\ntowards formulating a comprehensive National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with a view to reducing \\nvulnerability to the impacts of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience. Building on \\nNAPA (National Adaptation  Programme of Action) and BCCSAP (Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy \\nand Action Plan), the NAP will also facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation, into relevant \\nnew and existing policies, programmes and activities in a coherent manner, in pa rticular, development \\nplanning processes and strategies, within all relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate. \\nBangladesh is also under the process of updating the BCCSAP.  \\nNevertheless, the overall implementation of existing environmental l aws and regulations remains a difficult \\nchallenge. Capacity constraints at the lead Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in terms \\nof human resources as well as financial resources lead to limited implementation progress. Water quality is \\ndeteriorating; so is the situation of air quality. Cross country comparison shows that in terms of air quality, \\nBangladesh is the fourth most polluted country in the world. Similarly, performances in forest coverage and \\nprotection of the natural habitats put B angladesh at the low end of comparator countries. Indicators of \\noverall environmental performance place Bangladesh at the bottom 5% of the 180 countries compared. \\nThese suggest that the challenges moving forward are immense.  \\n1.8.2  Natural Disasters  \\nBanglad esh has a good track record in disaster management and the progress continued during the 7FYP. \\nThe progress with disaster readiness and disaster response continued to improve as reflected in well -\\nfunctioning early warning systems and sharp reductions in lo ss of life and injuries from natural disasters. \\nThis progress was defined by the government’s implementation of the National Disaster Management Plan \\n2010 -15, the enactment of the National Disaster Act in 2012, preparation of Disaster Management Rules in  26 \\n 2015 and the establishment of the new Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief in 2012. These \\nimportant strategic and institutional reforms brought in a major strategic change in disaster management \\naway from the emphasis on relief distribution to disaste r readiness. This strategic shift has enabled much \\nbetter preparedness, early warning system and swift on -time response to disasters.   \\nNevertheless, the continued substantial loss of crops, housing, assets and livelihoods, especially from \\nflooding and riv erbank erosion, suggests that in addition to continued progress with strengthening disaster \\npreparedness increasingly the government’s attention has to shift to better management of the \\nenvironmental and climate change risks by taking long term investments  in water management. The \\nimplementation of the Delta Plan during the 8FYP will play a major role in implementing the government’s \\nstrategic shift towards better management and reduction of natural disaster incidence, especially from \\nflooding, sea -level ri se, salinity and water logging.  \\n1.9 PROGRESS WITH GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS  \\nNoting the importance of good governance and institutions for the long -term development of Bangladesh \\nand for the timely delivery of results, the Seventh Plan continued the effort i nitiated in the 6FYP to \\nstrengthen institutions and encourage the practice of good governance throughout the entire public system. \\nThe Plan emphasized strengthening of judiciary, law enforcing agencies, democratic institutions, economic \\npolicy making insti tutions, decentralization and reform of public administration. Important progress has \\nbeen made in a number of areas. On the political front elections were successfully conducted at the national \\nand local levels in 2018 on a timely basis. The Parliamentary  Standing Committees have been strengthened \\nto provide checks and balance on the government through stronger parliamentary oversight. The judiciary \\nwas beefed up through allocation of higher resources. Law and order have been improved to protect human \\nlives and property.  \\nOn the economic front the planning process was strengthened through the preparation of many national \\nstrategic documents including the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS), the Bangladesh Delta Plan \\nBDP2100, the National SDG Action Pla n, the LDC Graduation Study, and the Perspective Plan 2041. These \\nstrategic documents take a careful look at the risks, challenges and opportunities faced by Bangladesh with \\na view to making sustained progress with national development and improving people ’s lives and \\nlivelihood.  Progress has also been made to improve the budgetary process by linking it to the medium -tern \\nnational development plans. The Medium -term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) is now an integral part of \\nbudget formulation.   \\nThe Government h as adopted a policy of zero tolerance to corruption.  To implement this policy, the \\nGovernment approved a National Integrity Strategy (NIS) in 2012 which identifies the contexts and \\nchallenges faced by different state and non -state institutions and it sets  goals for a large array of intuitions \\nto ensure integrity in their respective operations. In addition, given that corruption is largely held \\nresponsible for underperformance of the state, NIS document pinpoints a coordination strategy on \\nprevention of cor ruption and promotion of integrity based on the constitutional spirit, electoral \\ncommitments of the government, UN Convention against Corruption and the experiences of the different \\ncountries. To reduce wasteful use of public resources, utmost attention is  being given to public procurement \\nand public financial management. Internal financial controls and external audit capacities are being \\nenhanced in all line ministries and in the Comptroller General’s Office. The government has established  27 \\n the system of An nual Performance Agreements (APA) to enhance the state of accountability in line \\nMinistries and make them more accountable to the Cabinet.  \\nAn important instrument of governance improvement has been the adoption of ICT -based solutions to \\npublic business an d transactions. Increasingly procurements, licensing, permits and other government \\nfunctions and services are relying on e -transactions. Instruments of e -governance are also being transferred \\nto local governments for greater transparency and efficiency of services. The implementation of Rights to \\nInformation (RTI) along with a robust print and video media is also helping provide better checks and \\nbalances on the functioning of the government and the political system.  \\nPFM reforms have been initiated. The PFM  Action Plan, 2018 -23 has been prepared and implementation \\nis ongoing. Under PFM reforms, E -challan system and a new budget and accounting system (Ibas++) have \\nbeen introduced, new accounting BACS has been completed, and automation of National Savings \\nCertificate sales has been introduced.    \\nNotwithstanding this progress in the 7FYP, the government understands that institutional strengthening and \\ngovernance improvements are a continuous process that evolves and creates new demands for changes as \\nBangladesh moves forward.  Consistent with the long -term goal of PP2041 to attain upper middle -income \\nstatus in FY2031 and high - income status in FY2041, the government’s institutional and governance \\nimprovement goals will target a time path to attain the institution al arrangements found in present upper \\nmiddle income and high -income countries.  Consequently, the institutional and governance improvement \\ntargets of the 8FYP will be set up as a step towards these long -term goals defined in PP2041.       \\n1.10 PERFORMANCE DURI NG FY2020: THE COVID -19 ECONOMIC IMPACT AND \\nGOVERNMENT RESPONSE  \\nThe global COVID -19 pandemic has terrorized the world, unleashing huge number of infections and sad \\nloss of lives. The government took swift actions to control the COVID -related damage to life  and \\nlivelihoods. As an immediate first step to contain the spread of the virus, the government imposed a \\nlockdown on March 23 that was extended to May 30, 2020. The economy has opened up since then, but the \\ngovernment has adopted a cautious approach balan cing the risks of virus spread with the need to restore \\neconomic activities. On the economic front, the adverse economic effects of the pandemic are still evolving. \\nIn the very short term, many economic activities, especially in the urban areas, came to a grinding halt, tax \\nrevenues, the earnings from exports and investments have fallen considerably over the March -June 2020 \\nmonths. The government has taken a series of measures to reduce the spread of the infection and announced \\nseveral stimulus packages, es timated at Taka 1196.4 billion (4.3% of GDP), to help the needy and stem the \\ndownward spiral of economic activities.   \\n1.10.1  Government Policy Response  \\nTo mitigate the adverse socioeconomic impact of ‘global pandemic’ from COVID -19, the Government of \\nBang ladesh has adopted a Work Plan with four major strategic programmes  to be implemented in \\nimmediate, short -term and medium -term span. The four major strategies the government has adopted are \\nas follows:   28 \\n \\uf0b7 Increased public expenditure  with a target to create j obs in both formal and informal sectors. Funding \\nof foreign tour and luxury expenditures from the government budget will be discouraged.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introducing fiscal stimulus package  to retain workers in the manufacturing sector, to maintain \\ncompetitiveness of the enterprises especially in the export -oriented manufacturing sector and to \\nrevitalize the economic activities and business environment. The major policy interventions in this \\nregard are to provide several credit facilities at low interest rate from the bank ing system for the \\nbusinesses including MSMEs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expansion of social safety net programmes  to meet the basic needs of people living below poverty \\nline, day labourers and for workers in the informal sector. The major interventions are: a) Free food \\ndistributi on; b) sale of rice under Open Market Sale (OMS) program with a highly subsidized price \\n(Taka 10 per kg); c) cash transfer to the targeted vulnerable population; d) expansion of allowance \\nprogrammes  (Old Age Allowance and Allowance for Widow/husband Desert ed Women) to all eligible \\nperson (100 percent) of the 100 most -poverty stricken Upazilas; and e) expedite construction of house \\nfor the homeless people.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase money supply to maintain liquidity of the economy so that the financial shock from the \\npandem ic can be absorbed and day to day businesses can be operated smoothly. Bangladesh Bank (BB) \\nhas already lowered CRR (cash reserve ratio) and Repo rate to increase money supply and it will \\ncontinue if needed. However, special attention will be given so that  inflation does not increase as a \\nresult of increased money supply.  \\nThe detailed programmes  are summarized in Table 1.14, while the fiscal cost of these programmes  is \\nprovided in Table 1.15.  \\nTable 1.14: COVID -19 Stimulus Package (taka billion)  \\nSerial No  Name of the Package  Amount  \\n1.

The government has received budget support amounting to $1.0 \\nbillion from ADB, AIIB and WB in FY2019 -20. Balance of Payment Support amounting $732 million is \\nreceived from IMF. Additional $2.0 billion of budget support is expected in FY2020 -21 from Japan, ADB, \\nEU, Germany and EDCF of South Korea.    30 \\n 1.10.2  Macroeconomic Effects of COVID -19 \\nThe macroeconomic effects of COVID -19 are still unfolding as the pandemic continues to take its toll on \\nhuman lives, health and wellbeing. Based on a vailable evidence, the main macroeconomic effects for \\nFY2020 outcomes are summarized in Table 1.16. The effects were severe with substantial losses in GDP \\ngrowth, exports, investment and tax revenues. In the short -term, unemployment rate and poverty incide nce \\nare likely to increase. However, this increase would fall as income transfer measures happen and \\nemployment is restored. The measures taken by the government to stem the tide of the downturn in the \\ndomestic economy will take time to unfold until such t ime that the health effects of COVID -19 become \\nmanageable, workers return to the work place, and people resume their normal activities so that the demand \\nfor service like transport, hotels and restaurants, vacation, tourism, beauty care, education, persona l services \\nall return to normal levels. Importantly, the recovery of earnings from exports will depend upon how quickly \\nthe global economy gets back to normal. The recovery of both domestic activity and global economy is \\npredicated upon the discovery of cu re or vaccine for COVID -19. The best expectations today are that global \\nrecovery could happen in early 2021.   \\nTable 1.16: Macroeconomic Effects of COVID -19 \\nIndicators  FY20 Actual Outcome  Pre-COVID FY2020 \\nExpected Outcome  \\nGDP Growth (%)  5.24 8.19 \\nNominal  GDP (taka billion)  27964  28859  \\nPrivate investment rate (% of GDP)  23.6 24.6 \\nExports ($ billion)  33.67  45.5 \\nTax Revenues (Taka billion)  2207  3401  \\nFiscal Deficit (% of GDP)  5.5 5.0 \\nInflation Rate (%)  5.65 5.5 \\n Source: BBS, BB, EPB, MoF and 7th Five Ye ar Plan  \\n1.11 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EIGHTH PLAN  \\nThe overall positive record of Seventh Plan implementation and associated progress in development \\nmeasured in terms of poverty reduction, employment, human development and growth in incomes suggests \\nthat the Seventh  Plan strategy was on the right track. Important gains have been made in securing many of \\nthe targets of Vision 2021. In particular, Bangladesh has attained lower middle - income status earlier than \\nin 2021 while also achieved the MDG targets in most areas,  especially poverty reduction. This solid \\nperformance suggests that the Eighth Plan should stay the course of the Seventh Plan and focus on areas \\nwhere there are important performance gaps remain. The approach would be to pursue much of the same \\nstrategy i n a way that consolidates the gains while addressing the several implementation gaps identified \\nabove.  \\nThe COVID -19 reinforces the importance of speeding up many of the reforms where a performance gap \\nhas emerged. This includes revenue performance, private  investment climate, export diversification and \\ndomestic job creation. The tax performance of Bangladesh has been slipping over a long period of time and \\nthis must be reversed quickly with important tax reforms under the 8FYP. Similarly, export diversifica tion \\nand expansion of a diversified manufacturing base are of utmost importance. This will not be possible \\nwithout substantial increases in domestic and foreign private investment. The 8FYP will focus utmost  31 \\n attention to improving the investment climate fo r domestic and foreign private investment with a view to \\noffsetting the lack -lustre private sector investment performance in the 7FYP. Finally, the short -term \\nunemployment resulting from COVID -19 including retrenchment of overseas workers will present an \\nimmense challenge in the very first year of the 8FYP. Job creation accordingly will be a top priority of the \\n8FYP.  \\nYet, the COVID -19 effects also bring in new challenges. In addition to the short -term recovery to the \\nCOVID -19 losses, strategic changes will  be needed in several areas relating to healthcare and social \\nprotection. Both systems were heavily tested under the COVID -19 pandemic and the performance was \\nweak with large gaps. The 8FYP will emphasize the need for a complete overhaul of the healthcare system \\nwhich showed huge performance gaps in physical facilities, access to healthcare and availability of quality \\nhealthcare staff. The COVID -19 has also reinforced the need for a universal healthcare system with a \\ncombination of public and private health  insurance scheme. Regarding the social security system, the slow \\nprogress in implementing the NSSS and the inability to increase funding for social protection -related \\nincome transfers to the poor and vulnerable will need to be addressed speedily both as a  response to offset \\nthe negative effects of COVID -19 but also to increase the growth elasticity of poverty as well as economic \\nrecovery.  \\nIn addition to the above immediate priority reforms, there are four areas where the Eighth Plan would need \\nto probe de eper and take a more focused and comprehensive approach than was possible in the Seventh \\nPlan. The first concerns the need to build stronger institutions. The Seventh plan’s efforts to build important \\ninstitutions like the local government, the urban insti tutions, land administration, strengthening of the \\nNational Board of Revenue and the Public -Private Partnership did not take deep roots. These lowered the \\ncapabilities and services provided by these institutions. The strengthening of the judiciary, the Ele ction \\nCommission and other democratic institutions are also long -term challenges that require continued efforts. \\nSecondly, implementation capacity in public agencies and ministries remain limited that adversely affected \\nthe implementation of major public i nvestment programmes and public policies in transport and social \\nsectors. Thirdly, stronger policy focus is needed in the area of income inequality. In particular, reform of \\npublic finances that increases the equity of tax collection and public spending ar e of substantial importance. \\nEspecially, the equity aspects of public spending on education and health require considerable effort. \\nFinally, despite progress, the programmes in environmental management and climate change remain of low \\nimpact because they a re not properly incorporated in the mainstream economic policy management. Strong \\nimplementation of the Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP2100) for sound management of water resources, \\nclimate change, natural disasters and other environmental hazards will be a maj or focus for the Eighth Plan. \\nThe integration of climate change and environmental management issues in growth and fiscal policy \\nmanagement will be another high priority issue for the Eighth Plan.   \\n \\nIn conclusion, adequate progress under the 8FYP is not on ly necessary to stay on track to achieve the targets \\nof PP2041, but also essential to achieve the SDG targets.  \\n  32 \\n    33 \\n CHAPTER 2 \\nSTRATEGIES FOR PROMOTING  \\nPRO -POOR AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH  \\n2.1 DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT  \\nThe adoption of PP2041 defines the government’s long -term development strategy. PP2041 defines three \\noverarching targets: (1) Secure UMIC status by FY2031; (2) Eliminate extreme poverty by FY2031; and \\n(3) Achieve HIC status by FY2041. The yearly average GDP growth targets and the pace of reduction of \\nextreme poverty are defined by these government -set long term goals. The challenge for strategy and policy \\nmaking is to identify the specific strategies and policies that if adopted and implemented well will take \\nBangladesh to those development outcomes. The PP204 1 has established the broad long -term strategic \\ndirections and policy outlines that are associated with these development targets. The task of the 8FYP is \\nto flesh out in greater detail specific strategies, policies, investment programmes and institutional  reforms \\nthat are implementable and monitorable, and which will lead Bangladesh to stay on track for the \\nachievement of the PP2041 core long -term targets noted above.  \\nThe PP2041 rightly identifies growth acceleration as the primary vehicle to achieve UMIC and HIC status.  \\nBut it also recognizes that this rapid growth must be pro -poor and inclusive to secure the elimination of \\nextreme poverty by FY2031. Bangladesh has considerable positive experience with growth acceleration \\nand poverty reduction. The review  and analysis of that experience can provide very helpful guide on the \\ncore elements of a pro -poor and inclusive growth strategy.  There ae also important lessons emerging from \\nthe experiences of countries that have already moved from LMIC to UMIC and have  also substantially \\nreduced extreme poverty. The 8FYP can draw on those experiences as relevant to the political economy \\ncontext of Bangladesh.  \\nThe unexpected COVID -19 pandemic has complicated economic planning and policy making with its fast -\\nspreading fur ious and damaging impact on human health, confidence and economic losses. Planning under \\nthese extreme global and national uncertainties is a huge challenge. All countries are struggling and \\nBangladesh will learn from the good practice experiences as they evolve to manage the COVID -19 damage \\nand move towards restoring the growth momentum. While considerable uncertainties prevail, it is \\nuniversally expected that the COVID -19, like other historical pandemics, will be tamed eventually with the \\ndiscovery of a v accine or a cure or both.   As noted in Chapter 1, on the economic front the main implication \\nof COVID -19 for the 8FYP is the slowdown in GDP growth during calendar year 2020 over the March to \\nDecember period.  The current expectations are that global reco very will happen from calendar year 2021 \\n(Table 2.1). What is striking is the huge projected recession in the US, Europe and India in 2020. The \\nprojected recovery is in CY21 is modest.   \\n \\n  34 \\n Table 2.1: IMF Projected Short -Term COVID -Linked Global Growth Outl ook (%)  \\nRegions/Countries  CY2019  CY2020  CY2021  FY2020  FY2021  \\nWorld  2.9 -4.9 5.4 -1.0 0.25 \\nUS 2.3 -8.0 4.5 -2.9 -1.75 \\nEU 1.3 -10.2 6.0 -1.7 -1.4 \\nChina  6.1 1.0 8.2 3.6 4.6 \\nIndia  4.2 -4.5 6.0 -0.15 0.75 \\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook June 24, 2020  \\nLike other open economies, the Bangladesh economy is adversely affected by global developments through \\nthree major growth drivers: RMG exports; remittance inflows; and inflows of FDI.  RMG and remittances \\nare already major growth drivers. Although FDI prese ntly plays a modest role, the macroeconomic \\nframework of the PP2041 assigns FDI a growing and important development role in the hunt for higher \\neconomic growth, especially in view of the sluggish performance of domestic private investment in the \\n7FYP. On a  fiscal year basis that is followed in Bangladesh, the projected global downslide continues in \\nFiscal Year 2021. This will seriously hurt the expected recovery of exports, remittances and FDI for \\nBangladesh in FY2021.  \\n2.2 DEVELOPMENT APPROACH OF THE 8FYP  \\nThe i mplementation of PP2041 is envisaged in four 5 -year phases. The first phase starts with the 8FYP.  \\nSo, the main task of the 8FYP is to start the implementation of PP2041 in a way that it brings Bangladesh \\ncloser to the goals of attaining UMIC status, attai ning major SDG targets, and eliminating extreme poverty \\nby FY2031. In the backdrop of these factors, the 8th Plan takes the lead from PP2041 and centres on six \\ncore themes:  \\n\\uf0b7 Rapid recovery for COVID -19 to restore human health, confidence, employment, income  and economic \\nactivities.  \\n\\uf0b7 GDP growth acceleration, employment generation, productivity acceleration and rapid poverty \\nreduction. Thus, the average GDP growth is targeted to increase from 7.4% in the 7FYP to 8.0%, with \\nannual growth rate reaching 8.5% by F Y2025. Average productivity growth rate is targeted at 5.6%. \\nPoverty incidence is projected to fall from 20.5% in FY2019 to 15.6% in FY2025; while extreme \\npoverty is targeted to reduce from 10.5% in FY2019 to 7.4% in FY2025.  \\n\\uf0b7 A broad -based strategy of inclu siveness with a view to empowering every citizen to participate in full \\nand benefit from the development process, and helping the poor and vulnerable with social protection - \\nbased income transfers.  \\n\\uf0b7 A sustainable development pathway that is resilient to dis aster and climate change; entails sustainable \\nuse of natural resources; and successfully manages the inevitable urbanization transition.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development and improvement of critical institutions necessary to lead the economy to UMIC status \\nby FY2031.  \\n\\uf0b7 Attaining  SDG targets and mitigating the impact of LDC graduation.  \\n \\nThese 6 inter -related themes are integrated in the entire 8FYP macroeconomic and sectoral strategies, \\npolicies and programmes.       35 \\n 2.3 PRO -POOR AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND CONCERNS OVER EQUITY  \\nInternatio nal experience shows that sustained rapid GDP growth can play a key role in reducing poverty. \\nFor example, rapid economic growth has helped greatly to reduce poverty in East Asia, where the proportion \\nof people living in extreme poverty fell from 33% in 19 90 to 9.9% in 2004, and in South -East Asia, where \\nthe proportion fell from 41% to 29.5% over the same period. China, which experienced double digit growth \\nrates for three decades since 1980, lifted 600 million people out of poverty leaving barely 10 millio n in \\npoverty today out of its 1.4 billion population. Conversely, in sub -Saharan Africa, where economic growth \\nhas been slow overall, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has fallen only slightly, from 47% \\nin 1990 to 41% in 2004.  Bangladesh has a similarly positive experience.   \\nThere is also an emerging consensus among the development community that poverty reduction efforts \\nshould address poverty in all its dimensions —not only lack of income or consumption, but also the lack of \\naccess to he alth and education, the vulnerability to shocks, and the lack of control over one’s own life. The \\nmulti -dimensional nature of poverty is now an accepted principle, enshrined in the SDGs and endorsed by \\nthe UN member countries including Bangladesh.   \\nBangla desh has moved well with its comprehensive program of reducing poverty, focused on accelerating \\nGDP growth, improving human development, supporting the vulnerable and bringing equality of \\nopportunities amongst all groups. Although there has been improvemen t in building social safety nets for \\nthe poor and vulnerable under the NSSS, still a large proportion of population is outside the social protection \\nsystem and remains exposed to various economic and social volatility as illustrated with the COVID -19 \\nexper ience. Lot more needs to be done to effectively reach the target population.  \\n 2.3.1  Implications of Pro -Poor Growth  \\nIn order for GDP growth to have a significant poverty alleviation effect, it has to be pro -poor. Therefore, \\nmaking growth pro -poor has beco me an important development challenge for Bangladesh. Growth must \\ninvolve at least two features to be regarded as pro -poor: (a) the income growth rate of the poor must exceed \\nthe income growth rate of the non -poor. (b) A second requirement is that the meas ure should be sensitive \\nto the distribution of incomes among the poor in the sense of giving greater weight to the poorest of the \\npoor.  \\nResearch reveals that higher income inequality reduces the poverty impact of growth. Reducing income \\ninequality has the  effect of reducing poverty by giving the poor more resources initially such that it will \\nincrease the poverty impact of subsequent growth. Inequality is therefore associated with a low elasticity \\nof growth to poverty reduction. This arises when inequality  of opportunity is embedded in society, so that \\nthe poor are denied the assets by which they might build their livelihoods, and are disadvantaged –indeed, \\nin some cases face outright discrimination – in markets. Not only do the poor suffer, but so too does the \\neconomy as a whole, since the working poor are unable to contribute substantially. A particular concern is \\ngender inequality: women receive less education than men in much of Africa and Asia, have to provide the \\nmajority of childcare, and often confron t barriers in labour markets. Similarly, in many developing \\ncountries, significant differences in the provision of education and health services to rural areas compared \\nto the cities mean that rural people are at a disadvantage.   36 \\n 2.3.2  Implications of Inclu sive Growth  \\nIn the last two decades the concept of inclusive growth replaced pro -poor growth as the dominant focus of \\na growth strategy in international development discourse. The concept places a particular emphasis on \\nanalysing a country’s structural tr ansformation based on the premise that no country has been able to \\nachieve significant income growth and poverty reduction without it. It then further argues that the pace of \\ngrowth should be rapid to ensure substantial reduction in poverty and the pattern  should be broad based \\nencompassing all sectors and all parts of the labour force. The focus is on the nature of growth that is also \\njob creating or employment generating, which then becomes the conduit for the poor to come out of poverty.  \\n2.3.3  Equity Co ncerns  \\nThe concern with equity has emerged strongly in recent global debates on economic progress. This has \\nhappened partly in recognition of the fact that in spite of great strides made by the world in recent times in \\npromoting growth of incomes and ensur ing higher standards of living across the globe, inequality between \\nand within nations has not diminished. In fact, it has increased in many parts of the world, especially in the \\ndeveloped world and in parts of the developing world that have been enjoying the most rapid pace of \\ngrowth. This global concern with equity finds echo in the local discourse on political economy in \\nBangladesh as well. As growth has picked up over the last two decades, and brought poverty down in its \\nwake, observers have noted with dismay that inequality has remained high and if anything is getting even \\nhigher. For example, in Bangladesh, whereas income Gini coefficient (a standard measure of income \\ninequality) was 0.388 in 1991 -92, it has been rising steadily since, to 0.451 (2000),  0.458 (2010), and 0.483 \\n(2016). An alternative measure of income inequality, the Palma ratio tells the same story. The Palma ratio, \\ndefined as the ratio of income shares of the top 10% and bottom 40% of the population, rises from 1.73 \\n(1985), to 2.62 (200 5), and to 2.93 in 2016. Clearly, this indicates that as growth accelerated in Bangladesh, \\nincome inequality has been on the rise.  \\nBefore embarking on the analytics of pro -poor and inclusive growth it would be instructive to review the \\nstate of play regar ding change in the income of the poor relative to the rest of the population in a broad \\nrange of countries. One approach that is fairly common is to look at the average income of the bottom 40% \\nof the population. The World Bank, in its 2018 report, Poverty  and Shared Prosperity , has compiled data \\non how incomes of the bottom 40% of the population changed relative to income of the average population. \\nTable 2.2 provides a snapshot of selected (mostly) developing countries.    37 \\n Table 2.2: Income Growth of Bottom  40% versus Average Population  \\n \\nGrowth of income (2010 -15) of   \\nBottom 40%  Average population  \\nBottom 40% growing faster than average  \\nChina  9.1%  7.4%  \\nVietnam  5.2%  3.8%  \\nMalaysia  8.3%  6.0%  \\nThailand  5% 3% \\nBrazil  3.8%  2.2%  \\nEgypt  2.6%  0.8%  \\nBottom 40% gro wing slower than average  \\nBangladesh  1.4%  1.5%  \\nSri Lanka  4.8%  5.3%  \\nPakistan  2.7%  4.3%  \\nIndonesia  4.8%  4.8%  \\nUnited States  1.3%  1.7%  \\nBottom 40% with declining income share  \\nUganda  -2.15 -0.96 \\nZambia  -0.59 2.93 \\nGreece  -8.35 -6.98 \\nSpain  -2.16 -1.53 \\nSouth Africa  -1.34 -1.23 \\n \\nSource: World Bank (Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2018)  \\nThe evidence points to the successful stories of several East Asian countries (China, Vietnam, Malaysia, \\nThailand) where income of the bottom 40% has been growing faster than t hat of the average population. \\nBangladesh falls in the group of countries where income of the bottom 40% is growing almost equal to that \\nof the average population (1.4% against 1.5%). That is still better than a host of developing countries (e.g. \\nSouth Afr ica, Zambia) where income of the bottom 40% has been falling faster than that of the average \\npopulation. Inequality and poverty must be getting worse in both countries. The data points to the evidence \\nthat growth has tended to be more pro -poor and inclusiv e in the first group of countries than in the second \\nor third group.  \\nThe conclusion we can draw from the preceding analysis is that the pursuit of pro -poor and inclusive growth \\nin Bangladesh must also address the challenge of rising inequality that is bei ng experienced with rapid \\ngrowth of the economy. The growth enhancing strategies of the 8FYP must therefore embrace various \\nmeasures to arrest the rise of income inequality, by ensuring that average income of the bottom 40% of the \\npopulation grows faster t han that of the average population.  \\n2.4 RAPID GROWTH AND PROGRESS IN POVERTY REDUCTION  \\nAlong with growth acceleration, Bangladesh has made great strides in reducing the level of poverty over \\nthe last three decades, and especially since the turn of the present  century. During the 1990s, the rate of \\npoverty had declined relatively slowly -from 56.7 percent in 1991/92 to 48.9 percent in 2000. The following \\ndecade witnessed a sharp acceleration in both the rate of growth and the pace of poverty reduction, when \\nnational poverty declined more than twice as fast as in the 1990s -falling to 31.5 percent by 2010. It has  38 \\n continued to fall since then - reaching 24.2 percent by 2016, projected to be under 20% by 2020. But the \\npace of poverty reduction has slowed somewhat in t he immediate past decade (Table 2.3). Whereas the \\ndecade of 2000s witnessed a reduction of 1.7 percentage points per year, in the subsequent six years the \\nrate of decline was down to 1.2 percentage points per year. At the start of the 8FYP, prior to the CO VID-\\n19 crisis, some 33 million people were est imated to be living in poverty.  \\nTable 2.3: Poverty Trends: 1991 -92 to 2016  \\n(Head -count ratio; percentage)  \\n 1991 -92 1995 -96 2000  2005  2010  2016  \\nOverall Poverty        \\n     National  56.7 50.1 48.9 40.0 31.5 24.2 \\n     Urban  42.8 27.8 35.2 28.4 21.3 18.6 \\n     Rural  58.8 54.5 52.3 43.8 35.2 26.4 \\nExtreme Poverty        \\n     National  41.1 35.2 34.3 25.1 17.6 12.8 \\n     Urban  24.0 13.7 19.9 14.6 7.7 7.4 \\n     Rural  43.8 39.5 37.9 28.6 21.1 14.8 \\n              Sour ces: BBS, Household Income and Expendit ure Survey (HIES), 2010, 2016.  \\nThe pattern is quite similar for extreme poverty. After falling at a relatively slow rate in the 1990s, it fell \\nsharply in the decade of the 2000s, when it was almost halved – from 34.3  percent in 2000 to 17.6 percent \\nin 2010. Since then, the pace of reduction has slowed, and by 2016 extreme poverty stood at 12.9 percent, \\nprojected to be below 10% in FY2020.  \\nResearch has established a link between inequality and poverty. Even when growt h accelerates, poverty \\nreduction can slow down if distribution becomes more unequal. As discussed below, income inequality in \\nBangladesh has indeed been on a rising trend. The 8FYP must take this critical factor on board in promoting \\npro-poor and inclusive  growth.  \\n2.5 THE GROWTH -INEQUALITY NEXUS  \\nFollowing the seminal work of Simon Kuznets, the causal relationship running from growth to inequality \\nhas been characterised as an inverted U -relationship, where inequality first rises with growth and \\nsubsequently fal ls as a country becomes richer. Much work has been done since to explain this alleged \\n‘law’ of development and to test its empirical validity. The general conclusion is that there is no systematic \\nrelationship between growth and inequality - indeed, there are about as many instances of inequality rising \\nas there are instances of inequality falling with growth. Numerous studies of the East Asian ‘miracle’ \\neconomies have shown how policies played a critical role in helping them combine growth with equity in \\nthe 1960s and 1970s. Particular importance were policies aimed at promoting broad -based education and \\nmassive redistribution policies aimed at building broad -based human capital. The experience of Western \\nEurope also shows how high per capita income and low - income inequality can coexist with re -distributive \\nfiscal policies. Nevertheless, it has been noted, in particular, that inequality has actually worsened in all the \\nAsian countries that have moved on to a higher growth path in recent years - for example,  in China, \\nVietnam, India and Bangladesh.   39 \\n In order to investigate the forces behind rising inequality, it would be useful to look at it from a slightly \\ndifferent perspective from the one offered by the widely used Gini coefficient. It has been well -known for \\na long time that one of the limitations of the Gini coefficient is that by construction it attaches more weight \\nto the middle of the distribution than to the tails. This would not be a problem for comparison between \\ndistributions if the middle of the d istribution behaved in the same way as the tails – e.g., if any widening of \\nthe gap between the upper and lower tails was also accompanied by similar widening of the gap in the \\nmiddle of the distribution. This is indeed the implicit assumption behind the w idespread use of the Gini \\ncoefficient.  \\nBut the path -breaking recent work by Gabriel Palma has seriously questioned the empirical basis of this \\nassumption. In an influential study on income distribution for a large number of countries around the globe, \\nhe has demonstrated that the middle of the distribution does not generally behave in the same way as the \\ntails  In fact, one of the stylized facts that emerges from his studies is that the middle class – representing \\n50 per cent of the population belonging to  the five deciles from the fifth to the ninth – manages to capture \\na fairly constant share of roughly 50 per cent of national income in most countries most of the time. It is \\nthe changing division of the remaining 50 per cent of national income between the  bottom 40 per cent of \\nthe population and the top 10 per cent that drives the change in overall income distribution. Thus, when \\nincome distribution worsens it is usually because the share of the top 10 per cent goes up at the expense of \\nthe bottom 40 per c ent, while the middle 50 per cent of the population more or less hold on to their share. \\nThe changing pattern of income distribution thus essentially represents a struggle between the two tails of \\nthe distribution for sharing the half of national income th at is not captured by the middle class.  \\nThis finding has a clear implication for how best to measure the degree of income inequality. What one \\nshould look for is not a measure of overall distribution, such as the Gini coefficient, because the middle of \\nthe distribution doesn’t change much anyway, but simply a measure of the gap between the two tails of the \\ndistribution because that’s where changes mainly occur. The simplest such measure is the ratio between the \\nincome shares of the bottom 40 per cent and th e top10 per cent of the population, known as the Palma Ratio.  \\nTable 2.4: An Alternative Measure of Income Inequality: The Palma Ratio  \\n \\n1991 -92 1995 -96 2005  2016  \\n     \\nIncome Share of Bottom 40%  29.23  15.54  14.36  13.01  \\nIncome Share of Middle 50%  53.36  49.78 48.00  48.83  \\nIncome Share of Top 10%  17.41  34.68  37.64  38.16  \\nTotal  100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00  \\nPalma ratio  1.68 2.23 2.62 2.93 \\nSource: Calculated from the data on income distribution given in the reports of Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, \\nvarious years.  \\nThe trend of the Palma ratio between 1991 -92 and 2016 is shown in Table 2.4. Consistent with the Palma \\nhypothesis, the share of the middle 50 percent of the population has remained unchanged at around 50 \\npercent of national income. But the g ap between the top and the bottom has widened. Palma ratio has gone \\nup continuously – from 1.68 in 1991 -92 to 2.23 in 1995 -96 to 2.62 in 2005 and further to 2.93 in 2016. \\nThere is clearly a long -term trend of an increasingly unequal society. While the midd le class has held its \\nown, the bottom 40 percent of the population is continuously losing out to the top 10 percent in the perennial  40 \\n struggle over income distribution. That raises the question: was rapid growth over the past decade inclusive? \\nIf not, how d o we change the distribution of income as economic growth and income accelerate over the \\nperiod of the 8FYP. This has been addressed categorically in the 8FYP  \\n2.6 GROWTH AND DISTRIBUTION: THE BANGLADESH EXPERIENCE  \\nGDP growth embarked on a rising trajectory dur ing the 1990s and the trend has continued to date, taking \\nBangladesh economy to a substantially higher growth path. Growth of GDP accelerated from about 4.8 per \\ncent in the 1990s and further to 5.8 per cent in the 2000s, and 7 per cent in the 2010 decade ( Table 2.5). \\nThe growth spurt, in combination with continued slowdown in population growth, has resulted in a fairly \\nrapid increase in per capita income. In the 1990s, per capita income grew at the rate of 3 per cent per annum, \\nwhich amounted to a near doub ling of the growth rate of the preceding two decades, and in the 2000s it \\ngrew even faster, at 4.4 per cent per annum. While this performance was not nearly as strong as in some of \\nthe East and Southeast Asian countries during the same period, it was still  a remarkable achievement by \\nhistorical standards and also quite impressive in comparison with the developing world as a whole.  \\nTable 2.5: Decadal Growth Rates: 1990s to 2019 (per cent per annum)  \\n \\n 1980 -89 1990 -99 2000 -09 2010 -19 \\nGDP growth   3.72 4.80 5.82 7.00 \\nPopulation growth   2.01 1.70 1.32 1.10 \\nPer capita GDP growth   1.68 3.05 4.44 5.90 \\nSource: BBS  \\nRapid growth helped lower poverty but income inequality increased. The degree of income inequality, as \\nmeasured by the Gini coefficient, has increased f rom an average of 0.38 in the 1980s to 0.44 in the 1990s \\nand further to 0.46 in the 2000s (Table 2.6). The Palma Ratio inequality indicator in Table 2.4 conveys a \\nsimilar message of rising income inequality as growth accelerated. Thus, while the average li ving standard \\nin Bangladesh is growing, the gap between the rich and the poor is also widening.  \\nTable 2.6: Decadal Average of Income Gini Coefficient: 1980s to 2000s (per cent)  \\n \\n1980s  1990s  2000s  \\nNational  0.377  0.442  0.463  \\nRural  0.361  0.389  0.430  \\nUrban  0.380  0.471  0.475  \\nSource: Household Income and Expenditure Surveys of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (various rounds).  \\nAlthough the pace of growth has been rapid enough to bring about a substantial reduction in poverty despite \\nrising inequality, the worsening of income distribution is a matter of concern for at least two reasons: (a) it \\nindicates that the benefits of growth are not being shared equitably, i.e. growth is not inclusive; and (b) \\nhigher inequality lowers the growth elasticity of poverty r eduction.  \\n   41 \\n 2.7 DRAWING FROM CROSS -COUNTRY INITIATIVES ON PRO -POOR AND \\nINCLUSIVE GROWTH  \\nThe formulation of policies and strategies for pro -poor inclusive growth during the 8FYP may draw on the \\ngood practice experiences of countries that have reconciled high G DP growth rate with lower income \\ninequality. Global research evidence has identified six policy areas that appear to be effective in reducing \\ninequality.   \\n\\uf0b7 Early childhood development and nutrition interventions  \\n\\uf0b7 Universal health coverage  \\n\\uf0b7 Universal access  to quality education  \\n\\uf0b7 Cash transfers to poor families  \\n\\uf0b7 Rural infrastructure -- especially roads and electrification  \\n\\uf0b7 Progressive taxation  \\n \\nThe best examples of reconciling high per capita income with lower income inequality comes from the \\nexperience of We stern Europe where a strong redistributive fiscal policy that raises revenues from a \\nprogressive system of personal income taxes and uses that money for making income transfers to the poor \\nand the vulnerable through an expansive social protection system.  These countries also provide universal \\nhealthcare and free college level education for all.  In addition to the implementation of a broad -based \\nredistributive fiscal policy, specific policies can be taken to benefit the poor.  A few examples of specific \\nmeasures taken by selected developing nations to promote shared prosperity are illustrated in Box 2.1.   42 \\n  \\n2.8 8FYP STRATEGIES AND POLICIES TO MAKE GROWTH PRO -POOR AND \\nINCLUSIVE  \\n2.8.1  Projected Growth Path for the 8FYP  \\nThe pre -COVID -19 growth path for the 8FYP as sociated with PP2041 is shown in Table 2.7. It called for \\nGDP to grow from 8.13% in FY2019 to 8.19% in FY2020 and rising to 8.51% in FY2025. With the advent \\nof COVID -19, this projected growth path has been disrupted. However, most of the damage has happene d \\nin FY2020. GDP is estimated to have fallen to 5.24% in FY 2020 owing to the adverse effects of the \\ndomestic lockdown in the 2020 April -May periods as well as the effects of the global downturn in terms of \\nloss of RMG export earnings.  Data for the first 6 months of FY2021suggest that recovery is already Box 2.1:  Specific Examples of Policies to Benefit the Poor  \\n\\uf0b7 Since 2015, Ethiopia’s entire population benefits from basic social services. It uses block grants to regions \\nand districts for delivering basic so cial services in health, education, agriculture, and rural roads, water, \\nand sanitation. The support has achieved notable results in ensuring better access to services and \\ncontributed to the country’s impressive gains in basic services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Egypt’s reform program  focuses on creating opportunities for Egyptians and raising living st andards by \\npromoting the private sector and improving government performance. The new program, ‘Egypt Takes \\nOff,’ has a focus on promoting small businesses while improving the capacities of local governments to \\ndeliver services to their citizens and guide local development.  \\n\\uf0b7 Chile addressed  the challenge of unequal access to quality education  by adopting  policies to promote \\nequal opportunities in education. As a result, nearly 49,000 students received full scholarships for their \\ntertiary education. And the l owest grade in each school receiving public funding rolled out a centralized, \\nregulated admission system that saw 75 percent of applicants receiving their first preference for school \\nadmission.  \\n\\uf0b7 In Malaysia, the rapid income growth among the bottom 40 perce nt from 2011 to 2015 is fundamentally \\ndriven by rising real wages  and overall income of the bottom 40 grew at an annual rate of 12 percent. The \\ntiming of the increase in labor earnings coincides with minimum wage legislation passed in 2012, which \\nintroduce d minimum wages for the ﬁrst time, relevant to all workers except domestic employees. In part, \\nthe minimum wage was put in place to  address the dysfunctional wage -setting practices for low -paid \\nworkers. The increase of minimum wages has also been linked to  strong reductions in inequality in other \\ncountries such as Brazil .  \\n\\uf0b7 Almost all of the high performing Asian economies - Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, \\nTaiwan (China), and Thailand implemented policies based on the theme of ‘shared’ growt h strategies. \\nThe elites were held responsible for maintaining higher savings and eventually higher investment, while \\nthe non -elites were induced to focus on primary education, basic healthcare and land reform opportunities \\nto bring about a more engaging g rowth mechanism.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Indonesia has led the world in its policy of inclusive fossil fuel subsidy removal, introducing direct social \\nwelfare policies to support its poorest citizens while pursuing a green energy policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Rwanda has improved the ecotourism revenu e-sharing model, directing it to local communities as an \\ninclusive incentive to manage biodiversity.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 South Africa’s 12 “Working for Forests, Ecosystems, Coasts, etc.” programs combine environmental \\nimprovement with job schemes for disadvantaged women and men.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Philippines’ National Greening Program has shown that a targeted investment of US$650 million in \\nsustainable forestry can deliver effective forest rehabilitation alongside more secure livelihoods for \\nmarginalized indigenous communities.   43 \\n underway with strong turn around in exports, a solid agriculture sector performance and a surge in \\nremittance earnings. The government’s stimulus package is supporting this recovery and the government \\nnow expects to restore the growth momentum back to the PP2041 track. The government will continue to \\nmonitor the COVID -9 situation and provide continuous support to protect the recovery of economic \\nactivities as already seen in the first six months. Additional  policies will be taken as necessary to ensure \\nthat the economy remains buoyant and economic recovery and growth momentum remains on track as \\nprojected in the PP2041 and reflected in Table 2.7.    \\nTable 2.7: GDP Growth Projections under the 8FYP  \\n \\nFY20 \\nActu al FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nPre-COVID -19 GDP growth (as \\nper pp2041)  8.19 8.23 8.29 8.32 8.37 8.51 \\nGDP growth with COVID -19 5.24 7.40 7.70 8.00 8.32 8.51 \\nPopulation growth  1.39 1.34 1.24 1.22 1.19 1.18 \\nPer capita GDP growth  3.85 6.06 6.46 6.78 7.13 7.33 \\nSource: BBS and GED Projections  \\n2.8.2  Strategy for COVID -19 GDP Growth Recovery  \\nThe government has demonstrated its resolve to address the challenges emerging from COVID -19 swiftly \\nand comprehensively with a view to minimizing the loss of lives, restori ng the health of those affected, \\nremoving fear and building confidence, and putting the economy on a path of economic recovery while \\ntaking care this is consistent with the restoration of human health and confidence. In addition to \\nimplementing the actions  already taken in FY20, the government will take a number of far -reaching steps \\nto improve health care capabilities and facilities in the 8FYP.  Funding for healthcare will be increased, \\npublic -private cooperation will be strengthened, the capabilities of district -level healthcare facilities will be \\nenhanced, and Universal Health Care will be introduced. The economic activity opening up will be phased \\nand implemented in ways that risks to COVID spread are minimized. Bangladesh will learn from the lessons \\nof other country experience in fine tuning its health response to COVID -19. It will also liaise with the \\nWorld Health Organization and countries that are well advanced in medical search for vaccine and or cure. \\nAll efforts will be made to procure these benef its when available. The capabilities of domestic Pharma and \\nmedical research will be enhanced through research grants for research and innovation in the area off \\nCOVID -19 cure.  \\nRegarding economic recovery, strong effort will be made to fully implement the stimulus and relief package \\nannounced in April -June 2020. The social protection delivery will be strengthened through a more rapid \\nimplementation of the NSSS and increase in funding for poverty -focused social protection programmes. \\nTopmost attention will b e given to protect the jobs and enhance new jobs in the micro and small enterprise \\nsector that presently employ an estimated 28 million people. This will be done immediately through the \\nprovision of low -cost loans through the banking sector. The Bangladesh  Bank will work with commercial \\nbanks and the non -bank financial institutions how this can be done in a flexible and low -cost manner. All \\ninstitutional or regulatory barriers will be removed to reach out these enterprises pro -actively.   44 \\n 2.8.3  The Challenge  of Job Creation for Inclusive Growth  \\nThe pro -poor and inclusive nature of growth depends to a large extent on three important factors: growth \\nin employment; improvement in labour productivity and increase in real wages. The primary channel \\nthrough which g rowth contributes to poverty reduction by generating income for the poor is through \\nemployment creation. Productive employment is regarded as one of the main instruments for achieving \\ninclusive growth.  \\nGrowth to be considered inclusive needs increased job  opportunities, access to critical social services, \\nincome transfers to the poor and vulnerable through a system of adequate social safety nets. The principal \\nsource of poverty is lack of income generating capacity. Growth generates increased demand for la bour, \\nand the poor only has labour to sell. As employment opportunity increases, so also the labour share of \\nincome increases, which in turn further boosts growth - thus creating a virtuous cycle. But employment is \\nalso not only about quantity of jobs creat ed but also about the quality of jobs. There is sufficient empirical \\nevidence which suggests that as jobs increase in the formal sector, that leads to much faster rise in jobs in \\nthe informal sector, which are mostly low -paid and insecure jobs. In Banglade sh about 85 percent of jobs \\nare in the informal sector. Most employed in the informal sector would like to get employment in the formal \\nsector but the lack of education and skill remains the principal barrier for these people to transit into the \\nformal sec tor.  \\nThe government’s growth strategy so far achieved considerable success in accelerating GDP growth and \\nchanging the production structure away from agriculture to industry and services. This growth strategy \\ncreated many jobs in manufacturing, constructi on, professional services, transport, trade and other informal \\nservices. But there are three major challenges on the employment front.  First, employment growth has been \\nmuch slower than GDP growth implying that the employment elasticity of GDP is falling (Table 2.8). \\nSecond, employment in manufacturing and construction actually contracted between 2013 and 2016 -17 \\neven as value -added growth in these activities accelerated.  Third, the concentration of jobs in the informal \\nsector further increased raising co ncerns about the shortage of decent jobs. A major policy challenge facing \\nthe 8FYP is how to ensure that GDP growth acceleration creates more good jobs in the economy. This calls \\nfor a creation of jobs at a faster pace than in recent years in manufacturing , construction, transport, trade \\nand professional services that will also increase the share of jobs in the formal sector and thereby improve \\nthe quality of employment. All considered, for growth to be inclusive, job creation effect of growth is a \\nmust.  \\nTable 2.8: Employment Elasticity of GDP  \\nEmployment Elasticity wrt  2000 -2010  2010 -2016/17  2013 -2016/17  2000 --2016/17  \\nTotal GDP  0.57  0.25  0.17  0.44  \\nAgriculture  0.76  Negative  Negative  0.38  \\nManufacturing  0.83  0.39  Negative  0.61  \\nServices  0.46  0.64  0.36  0.51  \\nSource: BBS National Accounts and LFS data        45 \\n 2.8.4  Projected Job Creation Target for the 8FYP  \\nAmidst the downturn of the COVID -19 crisis, the 8th Five Year Plan focuses on strategizing inclusive \\ngrowth. The acceleration of GDP growth, generation of em ployment, and reduction of poverty are in the \\ncenter of focus in the Eighth Plan. The GDP growth acceleration from 7.4% in the Seventh Plan to 8.0% in \\nthe 8FYP period provides new employment opportunities. However, if GDP growth rates fall or overseas \\nempl oyment prospects remain tight, the domestic employment situation may face difficulty. The loss of \\nemployment owing to COVID -19 in FY2020 will need to reverse rapidly in FY2021 and FY2022. More \\ngenerally, the acceleration of GDP growth as envisaged in Table  2.7 will be critical to restore and strengthen \\nthe employment prospects during the 8FYP. Along with higher GDP growth, efforts will be necessary to \\nincrease the job creation potential of growth by making it more pro -poor.  \\nTo guard against the downside ri sks, the 8FYP will seek to take policy measures that increase the \\nemployment impact of growth. The main focus of the Plan will be to create more jobs through investment \\nand growth to absorb the new entrants in the labor market and those who lost jobs due t o COVID -19 fall \\nout. The Government will also be mindful of reaping the full benefits of the demographic dividend. The \\ncritical areas of 8FYP will be to stimulate labor -intensive and export -oriented manufacturing -led growth, \\npromote agricultural diversific ation, infuse dynamism in CMS MEs, strengthen the modern services sector, \\npromote non -factor services, encourage ICT -based entrepreneurship, and strengthen overseas employment.  \\nThe job creation projection during the 8FYP period is shown in Table 2.9. The o bjective would be to \\nincrease the employment elasticity of GDP to 0.30 in the 8FYP period which was 0.57 during the period \\n2000 -2010. The target of employment elasticity of 0.30 is consistent with the Perspective Plan of \\nBangladesh 2021 -2041. The governmen t will also take measures to boost overseas employment once the \\nglobal recovery from COVID -19 is underway in FY2022.  On the supply side, the projections assume that \\nlabor force will grow at 2.2% per year, which is faster than observed during 2010 -17 (1.6% ).  This is done \\nto allow for higher female labor force participation rate that is expected from the implementation of the \\ngovernment’s women empowerment policy.  \\nTable 2.9: Employment Generation during 8FYP  \\n FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nReal GDP gro wth (%)  7.40 7.70 8.00 8.32 8.51 \\nAdditional domestic employment (million)  1.43 1.52 1.61 1.72 1.80 \\nAdditional overseas employment (million)  0.58 0.61 0.65 0.69 0.72 \\nAdditional total employment (million)  2.01 2.13 2.26 2.41 2.52 \\nAdditional labour force (million)  1.49 1.53 1.56 1.60 1.63 \\nExcess employment (million)  0.52 0.60 0.70 0.81 0.89 \\nSource: Eighth Plan Projections  \\nUnder these assumptions, the total number of domestic jobs created will be much more encouraging than \\nwas possible during the 7FYP.  A long with the projected overseas employment, this will allow a surplus \\njob creation of 3.52 million that will be helpful in reducing the youth unemployment and curb the stock of \\nunderemployment in Bangladesh.  \\n  46 \\n 2.8.5  Strategies for Accelerating Pro -poor an d Inclusive Growth  \\nThe pro -poor inclusive growth strategy of 8FYP includes seven pivotal themes:  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote labour -intensive, export -oriented manufacturing -led growth.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote agricultural diversification.  \\n\\uf0b7 Infuse dynamism in the cottage , micro, small and med ium enterprises (CMSMEs)  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen modern services sector  \\n\\uf0b7 Push exports of non -factor services  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote ICT -based entrepreneurship  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen overseas employment  \\nThe main focus of the 8FYP inclusive growth strategy would be to create much more jobs through growth \\nthan was possible in the 7FYP both to absorb those unemployed owing to COVID -19 and to reap the full \\nbenefits of the demographic dividend. Structural transformation during 6th and 7th Five Year Plans have \\nalready laid the foundations for industry -led growth.  Manufacturing sector has taken the lead supported by \\nthe expansion of RMG exports.  This has increased the GDP growth rate, increased exports and created 4 \\nmillion jobs in the RMG sector.  However, non -RMG exports have not prospered that has con strained \\nexport diversification and slowed down manufacturing job creation in recent years, While the RMG sector \\nwill continue to play its major role, the 8FYP growth strategy will put top priority to the production and \\nexports of non -RMG manufacturing to diversify the production and export base in areas including \\nprocessed food, leather and footwear, light engineering, and pharmaceuticals. Many of these activities, like \\nfood processing and leather and footwear, are relatively labor intensive like RMG and h ave huge external \\nmarket.  So, like RMG they will create jobs and contribute to exports while accelerating value added growth. \\nEmphasis will also be placed to promote efficient import substitution activities with high domestic demand, \\nsuch as a range of co nsumer goods. Trade policy bias against exports will be removed through trade \\nreforms, the exchange rate will be made more flexible and competitive, and FDI and domestic investment \\nin manufacturing will be promoted through reforms of the investment climate  to implement this strategy.  \\nIn agriculture, the strategy will be to further increase agriculture diversification while maintaining food \\nsecurity through improvements in productivity, supply of inputs, price policy supports, water supply, farm \\ncredit and marketing support. Agriculture exports will be promoted to increase farm income and \\nemployment in non -crop activities especially fisheries, fruits and vegetables and dairy products.  \\nThe cottage, micro and small enterprises (CMSEs) hold the most promise fo r creating jobs in both rural and \\nurban areas.  Available data show that these enterprises account for 99.8% of all non -farm enterprises and \\n83% of all non -farm employment (estimated at 34 million in 2019). However, research shows that these \\nenterprises ar e mostly informal in nature and lack dynamism. They face a variety of constraints that are \\nvery specific to CMSEs and very different from medium and large enterprises (MLEs). These include \\nregulatory barriers owing to absence of registration and tax ID, in adequate access to institutional finance, \\nhigh interest rates, low investments, inadequate technology, weak skills and weak market access.  Global \\nexperience from Japan, Taiwan and Korea show the powerful and dynamic role of CMSEs for exports, \\ngrowth and e mployment. The 8FYP will place strong emphasis in dynamising these CMSEs by making a \\nconcerted effort to remove these constraints. In particular, the regulatory barriers will be simplified and the \\ninstitutional and financial support to CMSEs will be vastly  enhanced through the conversion of the SME  47 \\n Foundation into Small Business Agency (SBA) as in the USA that will serve as a one -stop shop to promote \\nCMSEs, working closely with the Bangladesh Bank on the financing side. Innovative financial solutions \\ninvolv ing ICT will be used to improve access to commercial bank credit through low -cost approaches to \\nloan applications, approvals and supervision. Credit Guarantee Schemes will be developed to reduce credit \\nrisks and to provide startup capital.  \\nThe services se ctor has already made substantial progress in converting from low -productivity informal \\nservices to high -productivity formal services in areas such as banking, finance, urban transport, ICT, health \\ncare, education and tourism. This transformation will be f urther enhanced by creating incentives for \\ndomestic and foreign private investment through regulatory reforms and supportive public investment in \\nrelated infrastructure.  \\nA major growth and employment driver that will be supported is the expansion of servi ces exports. There \\nis a huge trade gap in international shipping services and efforts will be made to capture a larger share of \\nthis market. Export prospects are also large in tourism and ICT services. These exports are highly labor \\nintensive and create em ployment, especially for educated youth.   Indeed, the ICT sector has begun to show \\ndynamising in various services activities and holds huge prospects for further job creation for the educated \\nyouth. The 8FYP will boost ICT activities through reductions in  ICT taxes, through expansion of ICT \\neducation and training and through eliminating all regulatory barriers.   \\nThe overseas employment and remittances have played a major development role during the 6th and the 7th \\nPlans, creating jobs, providing income an d investment. Remittance inflows have not only lowered poverty \\nthrough direct income transfers, they have contributed to transforming the rural economy by supporting \\nactivities and employment in a range of rural services including construction, housing, tr ansport, trading, \\nhealth, and education. The 8FYP will build on this solid track record and make further efforts to increase \\noverseas employment and remittances. The COVID -19 has adversely affected overseas employment. The \\nCOVID -19 has adversely affected o verseas employment, but remittances have continued to grow supported \\nby the 2% incentives offered by the government.  This adverse overseas employment situation will likely \\nbe reversed once the global economy recovers. The 8FYP will make a comprehensive pus h to expand \\noverseas employment and remittance earnings through G2G negotiations, by lowering the cost of migration \\nthrough low -cost loans from the Bangladesh Probashi Bank, by increasing training and other services to \\npotential migrants, and by stronger s upport in the work place against exploitation and abuse in host \\ncountries through the local Bangladesh embassies    \\nGender balance in employment:  Another challenge for labour markets is achieving equality in employment \\nopportunities for women. In most deve loping countries, there’s an unequal access to employment \\nopportunities and productive assets for women, and has no voice in any form of decision -making. Providing \\nsupport to organisations that promote women entrepreneurs in informal and formal economy, gi ving access \\nto finance schemes such as micro -credit, receiving better education and getting more support from men and \\nother family members are essential factors for a woman to freely indulge themselves in the labour market. \\nInclusive growth is elusive with  hindrances as such being prevalent in the economy.   48 \\n 2.8.6  Policies for Pro -Poor and Inclusive Growth  \\nEmpirical evidence from poverty reduction and growth experiences around the globe – particularly from \\ndeveloping countries – have led to a degree of consen sus around several critical policies that are \\ninstrumental in sustaining growth but also ensuring that its benefits are widely shared by the population. \\nAmong these policies are:  \\nMacroeconomic Stability . Macroeconomic stability is the foundation and a pre -requisite for growth. \\nUnstable macroeconomic environment, displayed in internal (fiscal and debt) and external (BOP) \\nimbalances in the economy, refers to a condition that adds a lot of uncertainty to economic decisions \\naffecting resource allocation choice s, investment, output and employment levels at the aggregate and firm \\nlevels. Exposure to currency fluctuations, large debt burdens, and unmanaged inflation can cause economic \\ncrises that stifles GDP growth. Since income of the poor are more volatile and v ulnerable to shocks, the \\nadverse effects are worse for them than the non -poor. There is incontrovertible research evidence \\nconfirming that high inflation, particularly above 10 percent, disproportionately hurts the poor and that \\nlarge budget and current ac count deficits eventually lead to crises in which the poor suffer \\ndisproportionately. Taming inflation through sound monetary policy should remain a priority \\nmacroeconomic policy to support pro -poor growth objectives.  \\nFiscal Policy for equitable growth.  The general consensus is that governments should try to keep the budget \\ndeficit low and sustainable in order to keep inflation low and protect the incomes of the poor. Rather than \\nadopting an approach that involves abrupt cuts in government expenditures, p olicy makers often have \\npreferred to take on a more gradual approach that involves broadening the tax base and greater toleration \\nof short -term deficits during stabilization. In developing countries like Bangladesh, there is no option but \\nto resort to fisc al deficits for financing development projects. To the extent that fiscal deficits finance \\ninvestment that raise productivity and growth they will not lead to unsustainable debt in the future. Growth \\nis expected to generate the resources to pay off public debt in the future. Public expenditures in developing \\ncountries boost aggregate demand, loosen the supply constraints on long -term growth and help to dedicate \\nresources towards poverty reduction goals.  \\nOnce the country has moved from its initial phase of growth and achieved higher income levels, fiscal \\npolicy should not remain as tight, rather the government should be willing to spend on human capital \\ninvestments and other infrastructure investments to make growth sustainable and more pro -poor and \\ninclusiv e. As for public enterprises, most research finds that loss -making state enterprises distort markets, \\nproduce inefficient outcomes, cannot cater to the needs of the poor consumers and divert resources from \\npriority pro -poor investments to less significant business ventures. On the other hand, there are instances \\nwhere privatization efforts have been captive to political patronage whereby public enterprises have gone \\nto political elites or prominent businessmen in society, have yielded low fiscal benefits to  the government, \\nand have increased the costs of services for the poor. There is now clear consensus that the business or \\nindustry is not the business of government. In the case where private enterprises operate and provide public \\nutilities policies must e nsure that services are unbiased and are available to poor households too, and the \\nprocess must be managed in a transparent and competitive manner. Tax laws or exemption laws favoring \\nthe well -off and undermining the interest of the poor should be avoided.    49 \\n Savings and capital accumulation driven growth  model has been the flavour of the development economists \\nin the 1950s and 1960s. The model identifies the mechanism of economic growth is a very simple function \\nof increasing savings and investment. Banglade sh’s growth is still driven by investment (i.e. capital \\naccumulation) which must be financed through domestic savings, fiscal deficits, external resources. \\nSustaining high growth with adequate domestic and external financing will remain the critical challe nge of \\nthe Government during the 8th FYP. To sustain 8%+ growth per annum, Bangladesh needs to maintain at \\nleast 30%+ gross domestic investment as a percent of GDP. In addition, it would be necessary to maintain \\nsolid investment in human capital – public e xpenditure in health and education – in the order of 5 -6% of \\nGDP.  \\nKnowledge based economy  presupposes that knowledge and ideas are the key factors of prosperity and \\neconomic growth. Capitalization of superior knowledge is considered to be the driving forc e in stimulating \\ngrowth in the rapidly spreading digital world and marketplace that can provide a sustainable competitive \\nadvantage. Developing countries like Bangladesh have the advantage of leapfrogging in the digital age by \\nimporting and adapting the la test technological innovation without making enormous investment in \\nresearch and development. Nevertheless, the 8th FYP should allocate adequate resources to continue \\nexpansion of existing infrastructure for ICT growth, science and technology and research and development.  \\nTrade -led growth  can combine both trade and economic policies aiming to speed up the industrialization \\nprocess of a country. The evolution of globalization and multilateralism created a world economic order \\nthat generated vast global mark ets for goods and services. It created deep elastic markets for goods of \\ndeveloping countries which could then exploit global demand for their growth. What became the new \\nparadigm of export -led growth experienced by East Asian countries in the 1960s throug h 1980s has now \\nmorphed into what can be aptly described as trade -led growth because of the most dynamic phenomenon \\nin 21st century trade – global value chain integration that equally involves import and export. \\nUnderstandably, this postwar global economic  order is now under stress due to rising tendencies of \\neconomic nationalism and unilateralism. These anti -globalization forces are still limited to parts of the \\ndeveloped world. Hopefully, there are enough critics of this new trend to stem the tide of degl obalisation \\nbringing in its stead more rational approaches that see the need for reforming the multilateral regime in the \\n21st century context rather than abandon it to the detriment of the global community. In the Bangladesh \\ncontext, trade -led growth will  remain a window of opportunity during the 8th FYP and beyond. While \\nemphasizing the country’s continued participation in the global value chain, e.g. in the RMG sector, efforts \\nshould also be geared to enhance intra -regional trade.  \\nExchange Rate Policy. Another policy consensus that has received wide acceptance in the postwar era is \\nthe advantage of flexible over fixed exchange rates. By and large, all economies have essentially abandoned \\nthe policy of fixed exchange rate and moved to flexible or floating exchange rates with different degree of \\nflexibility. Evidence is clear that overvalued exchange rates must be discarded by governments at all costs \\nbecause it destroys the incentive to export, generate a balance of payment crisis over time, and is typicall y \\nanti-poor because the rich have a much higher propensity to import. Currency overvaluation can dampen \\ndomestic production and employment, and can induce consumption and asset bubbles that may be difficult \\nto placate. While the orthodox approach is to man age competitive exchange rates, the more popular policy \\nstance undertaken by governments is to keep exchange rates significantly undervalued in order to make \\ntheir exports more competitive in the global market. This was the policy stance that supported exp ort-led \\ngrowth in many East Asian economies and continues to be the policy stance in China. Exports boost  50 \\n productivity, which exposes domestic producers to competition in the foreign markets. Export growth \\ngenerates trade surpluses and enables accumulation  of foreign currency reserves which can reduce balance \\nof payments vulnerability.  \\nSafety Net and Social Protection Programmes.  Strategies in relation to reducing income inequality include \\nsafety nets, social funds, microcredit, and targeted cash and in -kind programmes , especially in health and \\neducation. The drawback, however, of such safety net programmes are usually related to the extent of \\ninfluence they have on the poorer population. Not many have access to these programmes, or these \\nprogrammes are not run in an efficient manner because of a lack of incentive as well as targeting errors.  \\nGiven how difficult it is to make growth inclusive of all people and the urgent need for a strong and \\nfunctioning state to implement the pro -poor agenda, emphasis on st rengthening state capacity and on \\nexpanding its role in selected aspects of the economy should be considered. Further effort in improving \\ngovernance by strengthening democratic accountability and transparency needs to be put in place by \\ndeveloping nations who are in dire need to eradicate poverty.  \\nSocial protection refers to policies and actions which enhance the capacity of poor and vulnerable people \\nto escape from poverty and enable them to better manage risks and shocks. Social protection measures \\ninclu de social insurance, social transfers and minimum labour standards. These labour -facilitating \\nprogrammes stimulate participation of both men and women in various economic activities and contribute \\nto social cohesion and stability. It helps build human capi tal, manage risks, promote investment and \\nimprove participation in labour markets. Social protection programmes are usually affordable by the masses \\nand the returns from such spending can be made worthwhile if the funds are utilized in providing facilities  \\nand opportunities for the less privileged. Employment and social protection are mutually reinforcing. For \\nexample, if employment increases in the economy and a larger population has more disposable income to \\nspare, they may spend it on financing social pr otection. On the other hand, these programmes enhance a \\nworkers’ employability by increasing their productivity and skills, which in turn will increase the total \\nemployment in a region. Relevant strategies and actions are discussed in chapter 14.  \\nCritical role of governance . Considerable research evidence is available on the role of governance in \\nfostering growth. The consensus is that growth is generally pro -poor but it is not always inclusive. The \\ndeterminants of pro -poor and inclusive growth highlights e ducation, infrastructure improvement, and \\nfinancial development as the key factors in poverty reduction and inclusive growth. Moreover, to bring \\nforth economic prosperity, economic, political, legal and social institutions play a critical role. All of thes e \\ninstitutions need to be backed by sound governance mechanisms so that the spill -over effects of any \\nfavourable change is transmitted to the less fortunate as well.  \\nThe principal findings and policy recommendations on governance that have strong implicat ions for a \\ndeveloping country like Bangladesh, may be summarized thus:  \\n(i) in general growth is pro -poor: the income of the poorest 20 percent increases with per capita income \\ngrowth; (ii) globally, growth has not been inclusive; (iii) all features of good  governance, especially the \\ncontrol of corruption, are pro -poor, but only two features —government effectiveness and rule of law —\\npromote inclusive growth; (iv) structural factors such as education spending, infrastructure improvement, \\nand financial developm ent are key factors for promoting both poverty reduction and inclusive growth; and  51 \\n (v) the impact of growth on the income of the poor is nonlinear and declines with the level of corruption, \\nbut the impact of growth on the income share of the bottom 20 perc ent is linear.  \\nEconomic growth should be fostered and complemented with reliable and transparent public administration \\nand accountability, better education and labour market laws, so that the distribution of income is non -\\ndiscriminatory and support a faire r social inclusion. In other words, good governance allows better property \\nrights and business regulations, and ensures effective enforcement of laws by the system. Research also \\nsuggests enhancing human capital through health care and education expenditur e, infrastructure \\nimprovement and financial development were the key factors in bringing down poverty and spurring \\ninclusive growth. Even programmes that deal with infant mortality or HIV/AIDS can render a positive \\nimpact on poverty elimination.  \\n2.9 INSTITUTI ONAL DIMENSIONS OF PRO -POOR AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH  \\nWhile the preceding analysis has reviewed some of the key drivers of growth and the approaches to making \\ngrowth inclusive, setting priorities for Bangladesh economy requires a strengthening of several underl ying \\ngrowth -related institutions.  These institutional reforms include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring that the ministries/divisions/institutions responsible for implementing growth strategies \\n(ministries of finance, commerce, planning, NBR and the BB) are organized well, work  in \\ncoordination and are focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability (i.e. low inflation, low long -\\nterm interest rate, internal -external balance, exchange rate stability, low debt/GDP ratio etc.), \\ninstitutional quality and effective governance, rule of law and favourable investment climate. These \\nwill create a level playing field for all economic actors and will foster an enabling environment \\nwhere all people including the poor, be able to contribute and benefit from the growth process.  \\n\\uf0b7 Eliminating corru ption and rent seeking behavior through regulatory simplifications, e -\\nprocurement, online tax collections and online payments for all government transactions, setting \\nservice standards and transparent fee structure for public services and by establishing a n online \\npublic grievance redressal system with specified response timelines   \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring gender equality by providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, \\nemployment and representation in political and economic decision -making proces s. Gender \\nequality remains a necessary condition for achieving inclusive growth and to help achieve both \\nequity and efficiency  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhancing productivity (TFP) through training and proper technology as the basis for the creation \\nof increased opportunities for employment with special emphasis on the agriculture sector. The \\nemphasis should be on employment in the formal sector to keep pace with the growth of labour \\nforce and rural -urban migration. Productivity growth has the potential to lift wages of those \\nemplo yed and the returns to the self - employed;  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing increased incentives, opportunities and capabilities for employment generation and self -\\nemployment. Self -employment can be a viable alternative to employment. Employment growth \\ngenerates new jobs and inc ome for the individual from wages and self -employment;  \\n\\uf0b7 Enforcing equality of opportunity in terms of access to markets, resources, finance and unbiased \\nregulatory environment for businesses and individuals. Also, increased access to land, labour and \\ncapita l markets will help encourage new entrepreneurial drives;   52 \\n \\uf0b7 Promoting efficient and renewable energy which will enable increased access to energy creating \\nnew business opportunities and employment. Renewable energy impacts on poverty reduction \\nthrough increa sed access to energy which will enable the formation of new businesses and job \\nopportunities for the poor supplemented by financial inclusion.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reducing asset inequality (i.e. land and education) including redistribution of income through \\ntaxation (tax/GDP ratio is one of the lowest in the world) and transfer payments (if considered \\neconomically and socially desirable) and the promotion of environmental sustainability (poor \\nheavily depend on natural resources for their livelihood). The poor’s lack of asset i s both cause and \\na consequence of poverty. Also, growth and environmental sustainability complement each other;  \\n\\uf0b7 Pursuing more equitable spread of education and training, especially in rural areas (the correlation \\nbetween poverty and education is an acknowl edged fact) will help expand human capital base and \\nwill also act as a mitigating factor in countering technical unemployment. Human capital as \\nembodied in the accumulation knowledge, skills, talents, experience wisdom and intellectual \\nattributes can spear head growth through innovation and technological advances. In this context the \\nquality of education is also of utmost importance, in particular the quality of educators;  \\n\\uf0b7 Resisting trade protection pressures from vested business groups benefiting from high -cost and \\ninefficient industrialization and ensuring employment -intensive trade -led (export -led) \\nmanufacturing growth based on the nation’s comparative advantage. Reducing trade barriers and \\nincreased openness has positive impact on GDP by promoting competi tion. Also, trade tends to \\nalter product and factor prices causing wages to rise in labour -intensive export -oriented \\nmanufacturing which largely employ unskilled or semi -skilled labour;  \\n\\uf0b7 Encouraging and promoting participation in global value chains (GVCs)  with supportive policies \\nfor improved infrastructure, strengthening human capital (education and training are relevant in \\nthis regard) and incentivise research and development as knowledge and technology spill over can \\nenhance growth benefits of trade;  \\n\\uf0b7 Bringing about careful flexibility in labour markets with adequate income, working conditions, job \\ntraining and safety safeguards. These can enhance employment in the formal sector while measures \\nto be adopted to mitigate job insecurity and poor working con ditions in the informal sector (through \\nsocial security and legislative measures). Quite often cheap labour can turn out to be very expensive \\nlabour. In the case of job training there is scope for private -public partnership;  \\n\\uf0b7 Removing structural, institutio nal and systemic barriers for wider participation by socially and \\neconomically disadvantaged segment of the population to participate in and benefit from growth.  \\n \\n2.10 GOING FORWARD IN THE AGE OF COVID -19 \\nPart of the onslaught emerging from the COVID -19 pandemi c crisis is external and beyond our control. \\nPredictably, the COVID -19 crisis will result in weaker demand for exports stemming from the slowdown \\nof developed economies in Europe and North America – Bangladesh’s principal export destinations. This \\nwill cont ribute to a weaker outlook for growth and employment exacerbating the existing income inequality. \\nBut it is the rising protectionism in some advanced economies like the US and the collapsing multilateralism \\nin trade that pose a much serious long -term chall enge to Bangladesh.  \\n  53 \\n As a significant beneficiary of the global multilateral regime, Bangladesh will have to play a much more \\neffective role in the movement for reforms and sustainability of multilateralism and globalization in the \\nyears ahead as the worl d economy gradually recovers from the aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic. \\nHaving attained greater integration with the world economy in the past 25 years, it would not be in \\nBangladesh’s interest to revert to inward -looking policies. Neither growth nor its  inclusiveness will be \\nbetter served by the Bangladesh economy turning more restrictive to trade in the future.  \\nAs the Growth Commission asserts, the open world economy offers a deep elastic market for the exports \\nof developing economies, adding further t hat growth strategies that rely exclusively on domestic demand \\neventually reach their limits. Success in expanding manufacturing exports based on our comparative \\nadvantage in labor -intensive production still promises the way to shared prosperity in the fut ure. Bangladesh \\nwould be ill advised to walk away from this boundless opportunity for attaining its long -term vision of \\nbecoming an Upper Middle - Income Country by 2031 and a High Income Country by 2041. The COVID -\\n19 crisis may have strengthened our resolv e to achieve greater heights in development.  \\n    \\n   55 \\n CHAPTER 3 \\nMEDIUM TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK  \\nThe macroeconomic framework underpinning the Eighth Five Year Plan (8FYP) has been formulated \\ntaking into account the development vision embedded in the PP204 1 and the lessons learned from the \\nreview of progress —in terms of policy implementation and outcomes - under the Seventh Plan. It also \\nincorporates the effects of the global COVID -19 pandemic that has already severely and adversely impacted \\nthe global econ omy and Bangladesh. As noted in Chapter 1, while significant progress has been made in \\naccelerating GDP growth, reducing inflation and improving social indicators including reduction of \\npoverty, long -term macroeconomic challenges remained even in a pre -COV ID-19 environment. The \\nadverse effects of COVID -19 have hurt the macro economy, lowered GDP growth and created a spike in \\nshort -term poverty. Addressing and reversing this external shock and restoring the growth momentum are \\namong the most important develo pment challenge facing Bangladesh.    \\nSince the COVID -19 pandemic is still ongoing and the end date is not yet known, the full impact of COVID -\\n19 on core macroeconomic variables in the base year of FY2020 and the carryover to FY2021 is beset with \\nconsidera ble uncertainties, making macroeconomic projections in this uncertain environment a tough policy \\nchallenge. The 8FYP uses the available evidence of the impact in Bangladesh so far, uses the best available \\nprojections of global economic outlook prepared by leading international institutions, and makes best \\npossible assumptions about the likely impact moving forward drawing on the analysis of leading national \\nresearch institutions.   Drawing on these data and assumptions, the 8FYP projections are based on mul ti-\\nsector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and a consistent macroeconomic framework \\ncovering broad sectoral composition of growth, savings and investment, medium -term fiscal strategy and \\nbalance of payments projections consistent with debt sustai nability and external sector viability. Every \\neffort is made to be consistent with the macroeconomic framework underlying the FY2021 Budget. \\nHowever, since the 8FYP is based on a CGE model that has detailed production account and it explicitly \\nlinks the pr oduction accounts to the financial accounts, the projected numbers may be different. \\nAdditionally, the 8FYP macroeconomic framework is based on actual outcomes data for FY20 that were \\nnot available   when the FY2021 Budget was prepared.  \\n3.1 PROJECTED GROWTH P ATH UNDER THE EIGHTH PLAN  \\nThe projected growth path for the 8FYP is shown in Table 3.1. The sectoral composition of GDP is shown \\nin Table 3.2.  The strategy for achieving the 8th Plan GDP growth and employment targets along with the \\nunderlying policies and  reforms and structural transformation of the economy were discussed in Chapter 2. \\nThe main point to note is that the projections assume that the government will ensure a strong recovery of \\nGDP growth so as to fully restore the current COVID -19 stricken GD P growth path to the PP2041 growth \\npath by FY24 through implementation of various stimulus packages and policies discussed in chapters 1 \\nand 2. This growth acceleration is led by an export -oriented manufacturing sector and inflow of remittances.  \\nAlthough agriculture and services will continue to play the strong supporting roles as in the 7FYP, the \\ngrowing of share of manufacturing and industrial sector in total GDP shows its dominant role in spurring \\ngrowth. This sectoral composition is necessary to create  adequate number of good domestic jobs.    56 \\n Table 3.1: Macroeconomic Scenario of the 8FYP  \\nMacro Indicator  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nGrowth: Real GDP (%)  8.15 5.24 7.40 7.70 8.00 8.32 8.51 \\nReal GDP (Taka billion)  11058  11637  12,498  13,460  14,537  15,747  17,087  \\nGross National Income ($ billion)  316 346 376 415 460 510 566 \\nGNI Per Capita ($)  1909  2064  2170  2345  2555  2790  3059  \\nCPI Inflation (%)  5.48 5.65 5.10 4.90 4.80 4.70 4.60 \\nGross Investment (as % of GDP)  31.57  31.75  32.56  32.73  34.00  34.94  36.59 \\nPrivate Investment (as % of GDP)  23.54  23.63  24.41  24.53  25.32  26.08  27.35  \\n--of which FDI (% of GDP)  0.87 0.54 0.83 1.35 1.90 2.50 3.00 \\nPublic Investment (as % of GDP)  8.03 8.12 8.15 8.20 8.68 8.86 9.24 \\nNational Savings (as % of GDP)  29.50  30.11  31.43 31.17  32.29  33.03  34.42  \\nConsumption (as % of GDP)  74.98  74.69  74.31  74.12  72.86  71.97  70.41  \\nSource: BBS and GED Projections  \\n \\nTable 3.2: Sectoral Growth Projection for the 8FYP  \\nSectors  FY19  \\n(Actual)  FY20 \\n(Actual)  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\n \\nGrowth R ate (Percent)  \\nAgriculture  3.92 3.11 3.47 3.83 4.10 4.00 3.90 \\nIndustry  12.67  6.48 10.29  10.59  10.79  11.20  11.90  \\no/w Manufacturing  14.20  5.84 10.73  10.99  11.24  12.00  12.60  \\nServices  6.78 5.32 6.74 6.95 7.25 7.30 7.35 \\nGDP  8.15 5.24 7.40 7.70 8.00 8.32 8.51 \\n Share as % of GDP (Constant prices)  \\nAgriculture  13.65  13.35  12.84  12.36  11.89  11.16  10.56  \\nIndustry  35.00  35.36  36.25  37.17  38.07  40.37   41.86  \\no/w Manufacturing  24.08  24.18  24.89  25.61  26.33  28.75  30.23  \\nServices  51.35  51.30  50.91  50.47  50.04  48.47   47.58  \\nSource: BBS and GED Projections  \\n \\nThe contributions of growing labour force and productivity improvements will be important elements of \\nthe growth accounting. National Productivity Organisation under Ministry of Industries has prepared \\n“Bangladesh N ational Productivity Master plan FY2021 - FY2030”. It has set an average productivity \\ngrowth rate of 5.6% for the next ten years.   A major challenge on the growth front is to increase the rate of \\ninvestment from 31.8% of GDP in FY20 to around 37.0 % of GDP by the end of the Plan in FY25. This is \\na massive policy challenge. As noted in Chapter 1, Bangladesh production structure is undergoing growing \\ncapital intensity owing to the adoption of modern production technology. As Bangladesh continues to \\nupgrade its  production technology economy wide to increase labour productivity and competitiveness, \\ncapital intensity of production will go up requiring higher levels of investment to accelerate growth. This \\npattern is consistent with the experience of all UMICs like  China, Malaysia and Thailand who saw \\nsubstantial increases in the incremental capital output ratios, and therefore the investment rates, as they \\ntransited from lower - middle income to higher middle - income countries   57 \\n Both public and private investment rate  will need to increase. Additionally, the efficiency of investment \\nwill be important. For the private sector monetary, fiscal, exchange rate, trade and investment climate \\nreforms are important determinants of the quality and efficiency of private investmen t. In particular, \\npolicies must support the elimination of ant -export bias of trade policy and improve incentives for export -\\noriented manufacturing. The efficiency of private investment will also depend upon the efficiency of public \\ninvestment. As in the p ast, much of the public sector investment will need to be directed to major \\ninfrastructure projects in power, energy and transport.  Additionally, water investments, as advocated in the \\nBDP2100, and investments in education, training and health care would be critical to strengthen the \\nresilience of agriculture and the rural economy, fight COVID -19 and build up human capital.   \\n3.2 INVESTMENT, SAVINGS AND FISCAL POLICY   \\nNational savings will continue to be the main source of investment financing, although foreig n direct \\ninvestment is projected to play a bigger role in the 8FYP. Some 27% of the projected 9.1 percentage points \\nincrease in private investment will come from FDI, since the growth in national savings alone will not be \\nsufficient to meet the required in vestment level. Increased FDI is also necessary to acquire new technology, \\nimprove skills and enhance export markets.  \\n3.2.1  Mobilizing Domestic and Foreign Private Investment  \\nMuch of the growth of additional investment in relation to GDP is projected to c ome from the private sector. \\nThe deregulation process that took place in 1980s and 1990s continued during the 6FYP and the 7FYP but \\nat a slower pace. The main focus of these reforms has been to streamline the regulatory environment for \\nFDI and reduce the t ransaction costs by reforming the Bangladesh Investment Board into a one -stop shop \\nfor managing all clearance requirements and facilitating FDI. The establishment of the Free -Trade Zones \\n(FTZ) and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have sought to address the im portant constraint emerging from \\nserious land shortage and the associated complex land acquisition process. These institutional reforms have \\ncontributed to the increases in FDI flows during FY18 and FY19. Despite this progress, the private \\ninvestment rate fell short of the 7FYP targets. The shortfall was particularly serious for FDI (Figure 3.1)).  \\nFigure 3.1: Planned Versus Actual FDI Inflows (% of GDP)  \\n \\n                           Source: 6th FYP, 7thFYP and Bangladesh Bank  00.511.522.533.5\\nFY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019Plan Actual 58 \\n Importantly, total FDI flows in  Bangladesh are relatively insignificant in relation to total supply to \\ndeveloping countries. In 2018 total global total FDI inflows were estimated at 1.3 trillion US dollars, of \\nwhich developing countries received $706 billion (54%). The largest recipient s among developing countries \\nare shown in Figure 3.2. As compared with $3 billion FDI inflow in Bangladesh in 2018, FDI inflows \\namounted to $139 billion in China, $42 billion in India, $22 billion in Indonesia and $16 billion in Vietnam. \\nThese numbers easi ly dwarf the $3 -4 billion inflow in Bangladesh. The negligible share of FDI inflows in \\nBangladesh compared to the total inflows into developing countries suggests that the foreign investment \\npotential is huge. With concerted efforts to improve the investme nt climate, Bangladesh can claim a larger \\nshare of the foreign investment pie. This needs to be a major investment financing target for the 8FYP.  \\nFigure 3.2: FDI Inflows in Selected Countries  \\n \\n               Source: UNCTAD 2019  \\nThe strategy for mobilizing  domestic and foreign private investment for the 8FYP will focus on a number \\nof policies including: prudent macroeconomic management to ensure that inflation is contained, the \\nexchange rate is stable but competitive, private sector credit supply is adequat e with reasonable cost of \\nborrowing, essential infrastructure such as power, transport services are available through efficient public \\nsector investments, continued emphasis will be placed on the supply of serviced land through the EPZs and \\nSEZs, trade log istic costs are lowered through ICT based and simplified clearance procedures and \\nexpansion of port capacities, and most importantly there will be an overhaul in the investment regulatory \\nregime. The aim would be to substantially lower the cost of doing bu siness as reflected in the World Banks \\nDoing Business Indicators. Progress was already made in FY19. This progress will be continued through \\nbuilding up of the capacity of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) so that it can \\ntruly function  as one stop shop for all investment approvals. BIDA will also be geared up to do effective \\ninvestment promotion activities based on sound research. Strong effort will be made to simplify the \\nregulatory regime to minimize the need for clearances and where clearances are necessary these will be \\nstreamlined and mostly delivered online using ICT solutions. Service standards will be established for \\nclearances, especially property registration and getting electricity connection, which have been a severe \\nconstrai nt to improved investment climate. Areas where prudent regulations ae needed, such as bankruptcy \\nlaw and contract enforcement, will be strengthened and made more effective through the appropriate legal \\nmeasures that are based on good practice business expe riences. The foreign currency regime will be made \\n2142132406876111134692\\n3162232426178116139706\\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800BangladeshVietnamIndonesiaMexicoIndiaBrazilSingaporeHongkongChinadeveloping countries2018 2017 59 \\n business friendly and supportive of domestic and foreign private investment. The tax payments procedures \\nwill be simplified and made less burdensome through a major overhaul of the tax system that is a part  of \\nthe government’s tax modernization plan under the PP2041 fiscal policy framework.   \\n3.2.2  Strengthening Public Investment Effort: Critical Role of Fiscal Policy Reforms  \\nSince the Sixth Plan the government has been successful in reversing the declining trend in public sector \\ninvestment. This was possible owing the implementation of some important tax reforms that allowed the \\ntax to GDP ratio to grow from 8% of GDP in FY11 to 9.5% in FY2015. Although considerably below the \\n6FYP target, it was nevertheless  an important milestone. This progress in tax revenue mobilization faltered \\nin the 7FYP. Instead of growing, the tax to GDP ratio actually declined to 7.9% of GDP in FY20. The weak \\ntax performance has become a major development constraint. In recognition o f this, the Perspective Plan \\n2041 has developed a long -term fiscal target and associated fiscal policy framework. The 8FYP medium -\\nterm fiscal policy framework is based on the implementation of PP2041 fiscal policy framework. Tax and \\nfiscal policy issues ar e discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 in the context of the financing of the public \\ninvestment program of the 8FYP.    \\nDespite the revenue constraints, the 7FYP continued to provide increasingly greater allocation to the Annual \\nDevelopment Program (AD P) to boost the public investment program (Figure 3.3). Although revenue \\nshortage required some cutbacks, ADP programmes continued to increase as share of GDP. In terms of \\nbudget share, ADP allocation increased from 30% of total expenditures in F15 to 39% in FY19. Consistent \\nwith the growing demand for infrastructure to support accelerated growth, much of the ADP was focused \\non the completion of large transformational projects in power, energy and transport infrastructure. Strong \\nemphasis was also placed on  rural infrastructure (rural development and water resources). Thus, \\ninfrastructure development including implementation of mega projects took up more than 50% of the total \\nADP during the 7FYP. Most allocation was concentrated on transport with a significa nt number of \\ntransformational projects including the Padma Bridge. This strong focus on infrastructure was aimed at \\npushing rapid growth and was an important contributor to the acceleration of growth during the first 4 years \\nof the 7FYP.  \\nFigure 3.3: ADP A llocation in Relation to Total Expenditure (% of GDP)  \\n \\n                      Source:  Ministry of Finance  13.5 13.813.414.315.2\\n4 4.3 4.65.46\\n0246810121416\\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19Total expenditure ADP 60 \\n Figure 3.4: Public Investment Priorities in F7FYP  \\n \\n                        Source: Ministry of Finance            \\nThe public investment priority to infrastructure is well placed, but the need to mitigate the adverse impact \\nof COVID -19 will require some important re -prioritization of public investment.  The focus will need to \\nshift strongly towards building human capital through much larger investments  in health care, education \\nand training, social security and towards increasing the resilience of the rural economy by strengthening \\nthe implementation of the BDP2100. As in the case of transport during the 7FYP, the BDP2100 \\nimplementation will require a s trong focus on several multi -year and transformational water management \\nprojects relating to flood control, river erosion management, irrigation, and environmental protection.   \\nThe emphasis on transport and power will continue. But on view of constrained ADP resources and the \\nneed to reprioritize ADP to address the COVID -19 related risk mitigation, much stronger effort will be \\nneeded to channel PPP -type funding into power and transport. The power sector already has a good track \\nof attracting private invest ments, the PPP effort will place emphasis on transport network development. \\nThis will require a complete overhaul of the PPP institutional arrangements with recruitment of \\ninternationally experienced PPP experts who have proven capacity to mobilize foreign  private investments \\nin PPP -type infrastructure supply. Direct ADP funding in transport and power and energy will shrink \\nsomewhat as percent of total ADP but will continue to grow in real terms. The main emphasis will be the \\ntimely completion of all ongoin g transformational transport infrastructure projects. Public investment \\npriorities and resource allocations are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.     \\n3.2.3.  Preserving the National Savings Effort  \\nBangladesh traditionally enjoys a respectable level of natio nal savings rate in relation to GDP. The national \\nsavings rate was 29.5% of GDP in FY19. This high national savings rate is primarily attributable to high \\ndomestic savings rate augmented by generous inflow of workers’ remittances averaging more than 5.7% o f \\nGDP during the Seventh Plan period. Much of the financing of the projected increase in the national \\ninvestment rate will come from national savings rate, which is projected to grow from 29.5% in FY19 to \\n34.4 by FY25.   21.124.7 25.322.8\\n18.9\\n13.016.1 15.112.8 12.714.112.147.249.5\\n44.550.0\\n0.010.020.030.040.050.060.0\\n2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19\\nTransport Power & energy Rural Infrastructure Others 61 \\n Even so, it will be a challenging t ask for national savings to increase by 4.9 percentage points between \\nFY19 and FY25. Remittance inflows as a share of GDP has been falling since FY13.  Even after post -\\nCOVID -19 recovery, remittances are likely to continue to fall as a share of GDP. So, th e main source of \\nincrease in projected national savings rate is the domestic savings rate. As far as private savings rate is \\nconcerned, higher GDP growth and improved investment climate leading to higher rate of return on \\ndomestic investment would help inc rease domestic savings.  Government will encourage financial savings \\nby offering real positive interest rates to the savers. A part of the increased national savings would also \\ncome from the public sector through increased revenue mobilization efforts. Bas ed on the implementation \\nof the PP2041 Fiscal Framework, government savings rate is projected to increase from about 0.7% of GDP \\nin FY19 to 2% of GDP by FY25. The critical role of domestic resource mobilization for the successful \\nimplementation of the 8FYP  investment program is obvious.  \\nFigure 3.5: National Savings Trend and Outlook for 8FYP  \\n \\n                Source: BBS and Seventh Plan Projections  \\n3.3 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT  \\nBangladesh’s macroeconomic stability is underpinned by its strong external balance of payments position. \\nIt recorded external current account surpluses during most of the Sixth Plan period that was also reflected \\nin a rapid build -up of foreign exchange reserves of Bangladesh Bank. Even before COVID -19, the BOP \\nperformance weakened somewhat during the 7FYP starting in FY17 as export growth faltered and the rate \\nof expansion of remittances slowed down.   \\nThe RMG export revolution brought in tremendous value to Bangladesh in terms of export earnings, income \\nand employ ment. It brought in stability to the Bangladesh BOP, allowing expansion of imports to finance \\ndevelopment without creating undue external indebtedness or destabilizing the exchange rate. The success \\nof RMG however was not repeated in other export activitie s. So, over time, the share of RMG in export \\nearnings grew and exposed the economy to the vagaries of dependency on a single export basket. Following \\nsubstantial increase in the total global RMG market, RMG export growths have become much more 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.0\\nFY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25GNS (% of GDP) GDS (% of GDP) 62 \\n competitive.  Further market share gains have become difficult and RMG export growth in recent years have \\nfallen. As a result, total exports grew by only 6.3% during the first 4 years of the 7FYP as compared with \\na target of 10% growth (Table 3.3).  COVID -19 brought in  further difficulties as exports declining to $33.7 \\nbillion in FY20, down from $39.6 billion in FY19.  \\nThe COVID -19 related export decline is expected to be recovered as global recover happens.  But the \\ndisappointment reflected in export performance in Tab le 3.4 is that even with many difficulties RMG \\nmaintained a respectable growth rate of 7.5% in the first four years of the 7FYP but non -RMG export did \\nnot grow as expected when the full four years considered. They fluctuated intermittently between positive  \\nand negative growth showing no predictability or pattern of performance. This needs to be tackled with a \\nstrong export growth strategy based on a diversified export base. The 8FYP export strategy will draw on \\nthe findings of the recently completed study o n Graduation for LDC that provides a comprehensive \\ndiagnosis of what constraints export diversification and policy and institutional reforms needed to diversify \\nthe export base and increase exports.  The implementation of the policy package of the LDC Grad uation \\nStudy will also support the faster pace of recovery of the export market lost from COVID -19.    \\nTable 3.3: Export Performance in the Seventh Plan (million US$)  \\n  Jute & \\nJute \\nGoods  Leather  Footwear  Frozen \\nFood  Others  Non-\\nRMG \\nTotal  RMG  Total \\nExports  \\nFY 15  868.5  397.5  673.3  568 3077.6  5717.5  25491.4  31208.9  \\nFY 16  919.6  277.9  714 535.8  1582.9  6163.0  28094.2  34257.2  \\nFY 17  962.4  232.6  777.8  526.5  1770.5  6685.3  28149.8  34835.1  \\nFY 18  1037.8  173 809.7  483 1277.3  6053.5  30614.7  36668.2  \\nFY 19  906.85  411.9  879.41  500.4  862.3  5672.9  34133.3  39806.2  \\nGrowth Rate (%)  \\nFY 15  5.3 -21.4 22.4 -11 0.9 0.4 4.1 3.4 \\nFY 16  5.9 -30.1 6.0 -5.7 -48.6 7.8 10.2 9.8 \\nFY 17  4.7 -16.3 8.9 -1.7 11.9 8.5 0.2 1.7 \\nFY 18  7.8 -25.6 4.1 -8.3 -27.9 -9.5 8.8 5.3 \\nFY 19  -12.6 138.1  8.6 3.6 -32.5 -6.3 11.5 8.6 \\nSource: Export Promotion Bureau  \\nAs in the past, RMG sector will continue to lead the export growth strategy under the 8FYP. The envisaged \\nUS$ 23.5 billion increase in exports over the Plan period is underpinned by continued strong  performance \\nof RMG exports. This will require massive amounts of investment in this sector along with investment in \\ngrowth supporting infrastructure like power/electricity, land for setting up industries, transport, port etc. \\nThe other potential export ac tivities include leather, footwear, light engineering (bicycle and electronic \\nproducts), Information Technology (IT), home textiles, agricultural and food processing, pharmaceuticals \\nand shipbuilding have good potentials and are expected to expand rapidly under the 8th Plan. The \\ngovernment will address the anti -export bias of trade policy by reducing trade protection and will provide \\nduty free access to industrial inputs and capital machineries along the lines offered to the RMG sector. FDI \\nin these sectors  will be critical for increased investment, greater and easier market access, and transfer of \\ntechnology and management practices. FDI will also allow Bangladesh to enter into the intermediate goods \\nexport market and link Bangladesh with Asian value chain.  In order to facilitate FDI in the traditional and \\nnew sectors, the government is accelerating the process of setting up Special Economic Zones under both  63 \\n public and private sector initiatives. It also plans to hand over SEZs to investors exclusively from Japan, \\nChina, India and other countries in order to accelerate investment from those countries.  \\nImport payments are projected to rise in line with the growth in real GDP and the envisaged export growth. \\nOverall import elasticity is expected to be about 0. 9 with respect to GDP, broadly in line with past pattern, \\nand taking into account the higher imports under back -to-back arrangements in line with continued buoyant \\nRMG and other exports. The massive increase in investment envisaged under the Plan —supported  by FDI \\nand public sector infrastructure investment —would also tend to increase import payments. The sharp drop \\nin petroleum prices in FY20, and the softening of non -fuel commodity prices globally would also help \\ncontain import payments. The projected impo rt growth will address critical capacity constraints in the \\npower, transport, and water sectors, along with capital machineries and industrial raw materials for \\nindustrial sector expansion.  \\nThe summary projected BoP account is shown in Table 3.4. Although  exports and imports are projected to \\ngrow at similar rates on average, because of the higher base for imports (relative to exports) in dollar terms, \\nthe external trade balance will continue to widen in dollar terms over the Plan period. However, the trade  \\nbalance will remain fairly stable in the range of 5 -6% of GDP and sustainable given the level of remittance \\ninflows at about 4% of GDP. The services and income account deficits will widen due to growing payments \\nassociated with shipping, air travels, heal th care and educational expenses incurred by Bangladeshis, and \\ndebt service and other transfers associated with foreign debt (public and private) and remitting of income \\nfrom FDI and portfolio investment. Reflecting these developments, the external current  account will \\nexperience a modest deficit rising to 2.4% of GDP by FY2025  of GDP. This level of current account deficit \\nis justifiable for a developing country like Bangladesh given the growing capital and import intensity of \\ninvestment and the general imp ort demand associated with the higher real economic growth.  \\nThe modest deficit in the current account balance notwithstanding, the overall BOP position should remain \\ncomfortable.  In terms of financing, in the initial years, MLT loans will remain the most  important sources. \\nThe composition between the net long -term concessional foreign borrowing (foreign aid) and other long -\\nterm borrowing may change depending on government’s ability to utilize the new aid commitments and the \\nexisting pipeline and its willi ngness to borrow from the international capital market by issuing sovereign \\nbonds. Bangladesh’s current sovereign credit ratings with stable outlook should help the government to \\naccess international capital market if it decides to do so. A major structura l change in BoP financing is the \\nenvisaged role of FDI inflows as an important source of investment financing. FDI inflows will assume a \\nmajor role over time, growing up to 3% of GDP by FY25. This increase in FDI is a strategic policy objective \\nto boost pr ivate investment in support of higher growth and exports.

Bangladesh has traditionally managed its exchange rate flexibly \\nbalancing the need for export incentives with p rice stability and predictability of investments.  Yet, the \\nexchange rate has been appreciating in real terms during most of the 7FYP that has hurt exports (Figures \\n3.6 and 3.7) The Taka appreciated by 36% in real terms against the US dollar over the perio ds 2005 -06 and \\n2018 -19 (Figure 3.6). The Euro appreciated by 48% in real terms between FY08 and FY19 (Figure 3.7) . \\nThis extra appreciation against the Euro reflects the fact that Taka is loosely pegged with the US dollar, \\nwhich has strengthened significant ly against Euro.  The resultant appreciation of the dollar also transmitted \\ninto an additional source of taka appreciation against the Euro.  These appreciations of the Taka in real \\nterms against the two dominant global currencies where Bangladesh conducts  much of its export trade has \\nhurt export prospects and stemmed the diversification of exports.  \\nFigure 3.6: Bangladesh -US Dollar nominal and real exchange rate trends  \\n           \\n        Source: GED estimates  \\n 0.0020.0040.0060.0080.00100.00Tk/USD (nominal) Tk/USD (real) 66 \\n Figure 3.7: Bangladesh Taka -Euro Nominal and R eal Exchange Rate Trends  \\n            \\n             Source:  GED estimates  \\nThe 8FYP is committed to improving the exchange rare management to bring in greater flexibility to correct \\nfor the past appreciation of the real exchange rate and then make concerted  efforts to avoid real exchange \\nappreciation over the coming years. This flexible management of the exchange rate is essential to support \\nthe diversification of exports. Care will be taken that this flexibility is consistent with the inflation targets.  \\n3.5 FINANCIAL SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND MONETARY \\nMANAGEMENT BY BANGLADESH BANK  \\n3.5.1  Banking Sector Performance  \\nIn terms of its banking sector performance, Bangladesh faced major hurdles and setbacks during the 7FYP. \\nBanking reforms which started in early 19 80s, but gathered momentum in the 1990s and 2000s, brought \\nabout positive changes in most of the indicators of banking performance. Much of the serious reforms that \\nimpacted on the quality and health of the banking sector happened after 1999.  Banking sect or faced some \\nhurdles in the 6FYP but overall performance in terms financial depth improved.  Thus, M2/GDP ratio and \\nBank credit to GDP ratio, the two commonly used measure of the depth of a banking sector both showed \\nremarkable improvements during the 6FY P (Figure 3.8).  In the absence of a well -developed capital market, \\nthe growth in private credit has played a major role in supporting the expansion of the private sector in \\nBangladesh.  \\nThe banking performance was less satisfactory during the 7FYP. Both in dicators of banking sector depth \\ncame down, suggesting a relative slowdown of financial intermediation through the banking sector (Figure \\n3.8).  Bangladesh is still behind most regional comparators, except Pakistan. Bangladesh lags behind India \\nin terms of  financial deepening and well behind countries like China and Vietnam (Table 3.5).  \\n 0.0020.0040.0060.0080.00100.00120.00\\n1999-00\\n2000-01\\n2001-02\\n2002-03\\n2003-04\\n2004-05\\n2005-06\\n2006-07\\n2007-08\\n2008-09\\n2009-10\\n2010-11\\n2011-12\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16\\n2016-17\\n2017-18\\n2018-19Taka/EuroTaka/Euro (real) Tk/Euro (nominal) 67 \\n Figure 3.8: Indicators of Growth of Banking Activities  \\n \\n                      Source: Bangladesh Bank  \\nTable 3.5: Indicators of Banking Activities for Selected Countries (2 018) \\nCountry  M2/GDP  Bank Credit/ GDP  \\nBangladesh  64.3 46.8 \\nChina  199.1  161.1  \\nIndia  73.7 50.0 \\nPakistan  58.0 18.8 \\nVietnam  158.1  133.1  \\nSource: World Development Indicators, World Bank and Financial Soundness Indicators, IMF  \\nOne of the most important indi cators of the health of the banking sector is the share of Non -Performing \\nLoan (NPL) in the loan portfolio. Table 3.6 shows that there was a sharp decline in the share of non -\\nperforming loans (NPLs) from a high of 41% in 1999 to the lowest point of 6.1% in  both state -owned \\ncommercial banks (SCBs) and private commercial banks (PCBs) recorded impressive improvements in \\nterms of addressing the NPL problem. In particular, the NPL ratio of private banks declined to less than 3 \\npercent in 2011, compared with more  than 27% in 1999 but increasing to 5.7% in 2014.  Improvements \\nwere also made in meeting capital adequacy requirements with the industry -wide risk -weighted capital \\nadequacy ratio exceeding 11% as of June 2011.  The risk weighted capital adequacy ratio of SCBs also \\nincreased to 11.7% in 2011 from only 5.3% in 1999, in part supported by recapitalization of these banks by \\nthe government to meet the capital adequacy requirement stipulated under the Banking Act. The year 2011 \\nwas of significance given the favou rable outcomes of the banking sector indicators in the post -reform \\nscenario.  \\n \\n \\n46\\n52\\n48\\n42\\n49\\n47\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n2009-10\\n 2014-15\\n 2018-19\\nIn Percentage\\nM2/GDP\\n Bank Credit/GDP 68 \\n Table 3.6: Indicators of Health of the Banking Sector (Percent)  \\nIndicators  1999  \\n(Pre-Reform Baseline)  2011  \\n(Best Year)  2019  \\n(Latest Available)  \\nNon-Performing Loans: Overall  41.1 6.12 11.99  \\nNon-Performing Loans: Private Banks  27.1 2.95 7.43 \\nNon-Performing Loans: Foreign Banks  3.8 2.96 6.01 \\nNon-Performing Loans: State Commercial Banks  45.6 11.27  31.50  \\nNon-Performing Loans: Public DFIs  65.0 25.55  17.81  \\nRisk-Weighted Capital  Ratio: Overall  7.4 11.35  11.70  \\nRisk-Weighted Capital Ratio: Private Banks  11.0 11.49  12.70  \\nRisk-Weighted Capital Ratio: Foreign Banks  15.8 20.97  28.70  \\nRisk-Weighted Capital Ratio: State Commercial Banks  5.3 11.68  8.50 \\nRisk-Weighted Capital Ratio: Publ ic DFIs  5.8 -4.49 -31.20  \\n Source: Bangladesh Bank  \\nThe three main factors that contributed to the improvement in the coverage of the banking sector of \\nBangladesh are greater competition for market share, better regulations and improved supervision. The \\nopening up of the banking sector to private enterprises was perhaps the most determining factor. As a result \\nof this competition the share of private banks in total assets has grown from 37% in 2001 to 78% in   2020; \\ncommensurately, its share of total deposit  has expanded from 33% to 71% over the same period (Figure 3.8)  \\nTable 3.7:  Structural Change in Banking in Bangladesh  \\nYear  Deposits (taka billion)  Deposits (percent share)   Loans (taka billion)  Loans (percent share)  \\nPublic  Private  Public  Private  Public  Private  Public  Private  \\n1997  342 168 67 33 231 137 63 37 \\n2000  400 213 65 35 282 166 63 37 \\n2004  544 515 51 49 387 420 48 52 \\n2008  414 1902  18 82 573 1243  32 68 \\n2010  599 2768  16 84 737 1837  29 71 \\n2015  1757  5967  23 77 1291  4070  24 76 \\n2018  3139  6796  32 68 1802  6356  22 78 \\n2019  3290  7594  30 70 2014  7152  22 78 \\n2020  3546  8509  29 71 2269  7858  22 78 \\nSource: Bangladesh Bank.  \\nBanking regulations have been progressively tightened in the context of implementation of BASEL I and \\nII guidelines. Efforts have also be en made to improve the supervision capacity of the regulator, the \\nBangladesh Bank, through a range of technical assistance. Bangladesh started implementation the BASEL -\\nIII framework in the 7FYP but progress has been halting.  \\nUnfortunately, the financial h ealth of the banking sector has come under severe strain during the 7FYP. As \\nindicated in Table 3.6, the share of NPLs has sharply increased from 6% in 2011 to 12%. Much of the \\ndeterioration has happened with the loan portfolio of the state -owned commercia l banks, where the NPL \\nratio has accelerated from 11% to 32% over the same period.  The loan portfolio of private commercial  69 \\n banks has also weakened markedly with NPLs rising from only 3% to 7% plus. The risk weighted capital \\nof state -owned banks has also fallen, while public DFIs have become basically insolvent.   \\nThe government is committed to improve banking sector performance during the 8FYP. A series of policy \\nreforms are envisaged during the 8FYP including greater autonomy to the Bangladesh Bank for \\nimplementing its regulatory and supervision   responsibilities including for public banks, full \\nimplementation of Basel III regulations, improving the performance of public banks through corporatization \\nand requiring them to earn a profit, reducing the expo sure to high -risk borrowers, and implementing a well -\\nthought out policy for recovery of loans from wilful defaulters.  Monetary projections and credit allocation \\nassumptions of the 8FYP are based on the implementation of these prudential banking reforms.  \\n3.5.2 Monetary Policy Management and Inflation Control  \\nBB recognizes the imperative for prudent monetary policy and accordingly established quantitative targets \\nfor key monetary aggregates in each and every MPS in recent years. Accordingly, a cautious and r estrained \\nmonetary stance was pursued in FY12 to curb inflationary and external sector pressures.   This policy of \\nprudent monetary management has been implemented successfully through a bi -annual monetary policy \\nstatement (MPS).  Care has been taken that t he monetary growth target is consistent with inflation as well \\nas the credit needs of the private sector.  The BB has set realistic goals for the growth of money supply \\n(M2) and the growth of private sector credit. It has also closely monitored implementat ion.  Performance \\nhas been broadly on track.  Tight control over fiscal deficit by the government has helped reconcile these \\nobjectives.   \\nOverall, the inflation rate has been on a steady path of 5 -6% rate, with a slight tendency to go down (Figure \\n3.9).  This is fully on track as projected in the 7FYP.  Inflation control and monetary policy management \\nare two major strengths of macroeconomic management under the 7FYP.  The 8FYP will build on these \\nsuccesses and projects a further decline in inflation. The associated monetary and credit targets are fully \\nconsistent with GDP growth, inflation and the BOP targets (Table 3.8)  \\nFigure 3.9: Inflation Performance of the 7FYP  \\n \\nSource:  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)   \\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\nJun-15\\nAug-15\\nOct-15\\nDec-15\\nFeb-16\\nApr-16\\nJun-16\\nAug-16\\nOct-16\\nDec-16\\nFeb-17\\nApr-17\\nJun-17\\nAug-17\\nOct-17\\nDec-17\\nFeb-18\\nApr-18\\nJun-18\\nAug-18\\nOct-18\\nDec-18\\nFeb-19\\nApr-19\\nJun-19\\nAug-19\\nOct-19\\nDec-19\\nFeb-20\\nGeneral\\n Food\\n Non-Food 70 \\n Table 3.8: Bangladesh:  Monetary Survey, FY19 -25 \\nFiscal Year  \\n  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nActual  Projection  \\nComponents:  (In Billion Taka)  \\nBroad Money  12196  13737  15622  17803  20265  22983  26086  \\nNet Foreign Assets  2724  3015  3517  3969  4644  5586  6791  \\nNet Domestic Assets  9472  10723  12105  13834  15621  17397  19295  \\nDomestic Credit (a+b+c)  11469  13026  14795  16839  19154  21725  24664  \\na.

In its monetary policy operations Bangladesh Bank is committed to focus \\nprimarily on the quantitative targets and not on policy instrument s like interest rates.  Bangladesh Bank \\nrealizes that it is beyond the capacity of any central bank to influence or target both. Like most developing \\ncountries, transmission of monetary policy is considered inefficient in Bangladesh.  The development of \\nthe treasury bills and bond market will be keys to enhancing the transmission mechanism and effectiveness \\nof monetary policy.  \\nThe government has supported the reduction of interest rates to 9% on loans to boost economic activity, \\nespecially in the face of CO VID-19 downturn.  For the medium -term, the government will look careful at \\ninterest rate management based on research and evidence.   71 \\n Two inter -connected issues will guide interest rate management in the 8FYP.  First is the need to mobilize \\nfinancial saving s to support the need to increase the domestic saving rate. And second is the importance of \\nlowering the cost of finance for production and investment.  Evidence shows that the effort to lower interest \\nrate has caused the real deposit rate to be negative f or past several years, which has reduced deposit \\nmobilization and the rate of growth of bank deposits has been falling significantly (Figure 3.10). A slow -\\ngrowing deposit base in the face of rising NPLs could create serious liquidity and profitability prob lems for \\nbanks that could lead to financial disintermediation and hurt growth. It could also hurt the stability of the \\nbanking sect or that must be avoided. To reduce lending rates without driving the real deposit rates into the \\nnegative zone and thereby ca using financial disintermediation, the structural constraints in the banking \\nsector will need to be addressed.   \\nFigure 3.10: Recent Trend in Deposit to GDP Ratio (Percent)  \\n \\n               Source: Bangladesh Bank  \\nThe structural issues impacting the inter est rate structure generally include: efficiency of the banking system \\n(administrative cost, efficiency in managing loan/investment portfolio with proper balance between risk \\nand return, return on capital etc.); openness of the financial market (capital ac count openness); state of \\ndevelopment of the financial system including bond market; etc.  \\nIn a well -managed and relatively efficient banking system the level of spread could be as low as 2% to 3%, \\ncompared to more than 5% for Bangladesh. The higher spread  in Bangladesh is thus a manifestation of \\nstructural weaknesses or inefficiencies of the banking system as a whole. The spread could be explained by \\ndevelopments in three major components:  \\n1. Administrative costs of banks such as operating expenses, excludin g interest cost. Although not very \\nhigh, when compared with countries with more efficient financial system and lower spread, there is \\nscope for some improvement in this area.  \\n2. Provisioning requirements associated with classified/bad loans always significan tly affect the interest \\nrate spread. Bangladesh’s Gross and Net NPL ratios have always been quite high relative comparator \\ncountries.   49.0\\n47.7\\n46.6\\n46.1\\n44.545.045.546.046.547.047.548.048.549.049.5\\nFY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 72 \\n 3. Corporate tax rate applied on pre -tax profits of commercial banks also impact interest rates. \\nBangladesh’s corporate tax  rate on banks at 42.5% is the highest in the region and adds to the wider \\nspread.  \\n \\nFor healthy growth in domestic savings and the deposit base during the 8FYP, banks will continue to offer \\nat least marginally positive real interest rates to the depositors . Bangladesh bank will continue its efforts to \\nreduce inflation further to ensure a sustained lowering of the structure of deposit and lending rates. At the \\nsame time Bangladesh’s very high NPL --at more than 12% compared with only 1% -3% for countries like \\nChina, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand points to the fact that inefficiencies in our financial intermediation \\nmust be firmly addressed to reduce the spread between the deposit and lending rates. Bangladesh Bank and \\nthe government will strengthen significa ntly banking sector governance and supervision in order to reduce \\nthe lending rate without creating market distortions.  \\nA rough rule of thumb could be to target real average deposit rates at 2 -3 percent and real average lending \\nrates in the range of 6 -7 percent, which is similar or even lower thsan the marginal productivity of capital.  \\nInterest rates offered on specific products would be market determined based on supply and demand for \\nsuch loans and associated risks.  \\nOver the longer term, since Banglades h is aspiring to move to UMIC and HIC in the next 20 years or so, it \\nis appropriate that instead of pursuing a control -oriented and administratively determined interest rate \\npolicy, Bangladesh will adopt a proper market -driven interest rate policy. As in o ther UMIC, Bangladesh \\ncan influence interest rate level through a proper use of monetary policy instruments.  Presently, the link  \\nbetween monetary policy instruments (reserve requirements, BB discount rate and open market operations \\ninvolving sale and pur chase of Tresury bills) is weakened by the absence of a well -developedond market.  \\nThe government can spur the development of the bond market by opening up the market for Treasury bills \\n(T-bills) for private trading.  This will then set a benchmark for oth er interest rates. The BB can then \\ninfluence interest rates more effectivelythrough the supply of T -bills as a key monetary policy instrument. \\nThis would modernize interest rate management and offer savers a major secured financial asset. It would \\nalso fac ilitate deposit mobilization as banks compete with each other through attractive financial products \\nas substitutes for T -bills.        \\n3.5.4  Strategies to Improve the Capital Market  \\nIn last two and half decades, capital market witnessed a number of institu tional and regulatory \\nadvancements which have resulted diversified capital market intermediaries. At present, capital market \\ninstitutions and intermediaries are of following types: Stock Exchanges, Stock Dealer/Sock Brokers, \\nMerchant Bankers and Portfolio Managers, Asset Management Companies, Credit Rating Companies, \\nTrustees/Custodians and the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB). The primary segment of capital \\nmarket is operated through private and public offering of equity and bond instruments. The  secondary \\nsegment of capital market is institutionalized by two stock exchanges --Dhaka Stock Exchange and \\nChittagong Stock Exchange. The instruments in these exchanges are equity securities (shares), debentures, \\ncorporate bonds and treasury bonds. The cap ital market in Bangladesh is regulated by Bangladesh the \\nSecurities Exchange Commission (BSEC).   73 \\n Indicators of capital market development:   During 2007 -10 the capital market in Bangladesh grew much \\nfaster than the other segments of the financial market. Thi s growth in the capital market was initially fueled \\nby stronger economic fundamentals compared to valuation of stocks. Afterwards, speculative forces had \\ntaken various key market indicators like the market capitalization, price earnings ratio and market tu rnover \\nto unprecedented levels. This was further fueled by an expansionary monetary policy and lax management \\nof the stock exchange.  The stock market bubble finally burst in early 2011.  Series of reforms since then \\nhave made progress in stabilizing the s tock market, but it still remains fragile and faces considerable \\nuncertainty.  \\nTable 3.9 shows some selected indicators of capital market developments referring to three choice of years, \\nFY07 representing the pre -bubble era, FY10 representing the peak bubb le year and finally FY19 showing \\nthe current year scenario. It can be observed that market capitalization and the DSE General price index \\nincreased dramatically during 2007 -10 reaching a peak in 2010.  \\nTable 3.9: Indicators of Capital Market Developments (D SE) \\n  FY 2007  \\nPre-Bubble  FY 2010  \\nPeak of Bubble  FY 2019  \\nNumber of Listed Securities  281 279 363 \\nIssued Equity and Debt (Billion Taka)  84 213 720 \\nMarket Capitalization (Billion Taka)  412 2,277  3,437  \\nTurnover (Billion Taka)  0.2 2.7 4.0 \\nGeneral Price I ndex  2,149  6,154  N/A \\nDSE Broad Index  N/A N/A 5,422  \\nDSE -30 Index  N/A N/A 1,929  \\nSource: Bangladesh Bank.  \\nKey stock market reforms:  Against this background, the government undertook a substantial capital \\nmarket development program –CMDPII --with support fr om the ADB. The major objectives of CMDP II \\nwere to:   \\n(a) strengthen market stability by enhancing the role and capacity of the Bangladesh Securities and \\nExchange Commission (BSEC);  \\n(b) enhance market facilitation by developing a long -term vision for capital mar kets, upgrading \\naccounting and auditing standards, expediting adjudication of enforcement actions, improving \\ngovernance of listed companies, and pursuing demutualization of the stock exchanges; and  \\n(c) incentivize the issuance of equities and bonds, develop l iquid capital markets, and catalyze \\ninstitutional investors.  \\n \\nImportant progress was made in implementing many of the reform programmes  including legal and \\nregulatory reforms aimed at minimizing risks, improving the transparency of stock market trading an d \\ninformation, streamlining tax incentives and improving the capacity of the Bangladesh Securities and \\nExchange Commission (BSEC) .  Overall progress was positive, as discussed below, but several constraints \\nremained.   First,  the overall performance of BSEC  has not been up to the expectation. Irregularities, long \\nand complex IPO process, approval of substandard companies for IPO in recent years, inadequate and lack  74 \\n of timely surveillance leading to questionable movement of stock prices have raised serious go vernance \\nissues regarding the stock market regulator BSEC. No good national and international companies have \\nlisted in the stock exchanges after the listing of Grameen Phone. Second , economic fundamentals have also \\nweakened over time, particularly for the major sectors like banking and other financial sectors, textiles, and \\nmany others. Profitability of institutions in these sectors has gone down with consequent negative impact \\non stock prices. Foreign investors are also cashing out and staying in the sidel ine in anticipation of a major \\ndepreciation of Bangladesh Taka which is perceived by the market as overvalued. Third, the market also \\nsuffers from shortage of liquidity as a result of liquidity shortage in the banking system. Recently \\nBangladesh Bank has i ntroduced a special rediscount window for every bank to borrow up to Tk. 2 billion \\nfrom the central bank at a subsidized interest rate for on -lending to institutional investors in the stock \\nmarket.  \\nRecovery of market capitalization:  The market capitalizat ion as a percentage of GDP increased from \\n5.5% in 2005 to more than 29% at its peak, before falling to 14% at the end of June 2019. Although market \\ncapitalization is yet to recover, it has basically stabilized at around 14 -16 percent thereby arresting the \\ndownward trend.  This is a positive development that lowers the volatility and unpredictability of the stock \\nmarket, thereby minimizing speculative bouts.  \\nFigure 3.11: Market Capitalization to GDP Ratio from FY07 to FY19  \\n \\n          Source: Bangladesh Bank  Monthly Economic Trends  \\nPrice -earnings ratio:   As regard valuation, certainly the current Price -Earning (P/E) Ratio of 14.25 as of \\nJune 2019 is much more attractive from investors’ perspective compared with the average P/E Ratio of \\n24.08 at its recent pea k in June 2010 (Figure 3.12).  Accordingly, investors’ interests have returned . The \\nP/E ratio has remained broadly stable at around 14 -16 range, which is healthy.  \\n  \\n 7131429\\n25\\n18\\n1618 18\\n1516\\n1414\\n051015202530\\nFY07 FY08 FY09 FY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19Percent of GDP\\nFiscal Year 75 \\n Figure 3.12: P/E Ratio at the Dhaka Stock Exchange from FY10 to FY19  \\n \\n        Source:  Dhaka Stock Exchange Monthly Review  \\nA review of DSE’s past performance and a comparison with regional comparators indicates that:  \\n\\uf0b7 Average P/E Ratio of 13.5 for the DSE in July 2019 was in line with the levels observed in most \\ncountries such as Thailand, Malay sia, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong. The only outlier is India, which \\nis considered to be over -valued and many are predicting that the Indian market valuations are out \\nof line with market fundamentals.  \\n\\uf0b7 Bangladesh’s dividend yield at close to 4% also compares ver y favorably with all other regional \\ncomparators.  \\nFigure 3.13: P/E Ratio in Bangladesh and Some Asian Markets as of July 2019  \\n \\n                   Source: CEIC  24.08\\n16.55\\n12.5314.6018.58\\n15.9014.6015.70 15.1714.25\\n051015202530\\nFY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19P/E Ratio\\nFiscal Year\\n13.5 14.1\\n11.528.9\\n18.516.418.8\\n14.1\\n8.6\\n05101520253035P/E Ratio\\nCountry 76 \\n Turnover as a percentage of market capitalization:  Market dynamism is generally measured in terms  of \\nmarket activities like the value of daily turnovers or volume of buys/sales. In order to filter the volatility in \\ndaily turnover, 20 -day moving average for DSE daily turnover as percent of market capitalization is \\nmeasured. What is important is that de spite the steady decline, the turnover ratios were still comparable \\nwith its levels recorded during 2004 -06 and before when the market was functioning in a stable \\nenvironment.  This stability is an important indicator of normalcy in the functioning of the stock exchange \\nthat provides a basis for increases based on marker fundamentals instead of speculative episodes.  \\nFigure 3.14: Turnover as a Percentage of Market Capitalization, FY07 -FY19  \\n \\n                  Source: Bangladesh Bank  \\nCapital Market Reforms d uring the 8FYP  \\nDespite challenges, there are positive signs that are indicative of future market stability. Foreign portfolio \\ninvestment has been increasingly noticeably, attracted by proper valuation, macroeconomic stability and \\ngrowth potential of the ec onomy.  Increasing the number of IPOs of large and financially sound companies \\nand attracting foreign investment will help support the market stability and growth.  \\nIn the case of the 8FYP, the reform agenda has largely been identified, and despite some de lays much of \\nthe reform agenda have been implemented. In particular, the demutualization of stock exchanges to \\nsegregate ownership, management and trading rights of members will help convert the two major exchanges \\n(Dhaka and Chittagong) into commercially and professionally run organizations. Improved governance \\nstructure should also help develop the market and attract new investors.  \\nIn order to enhance supply and demand for equities over the 8FYP, effort will be made to restore confidence \\nthrough the foll owing reforms:  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrading of accounting and auditing standards to enhance market confidence. The newly \\nestablished Financial Reporting Council (FRC) will adopt and monitor the implementation of 406989113140\\n61\\n434742 41564942\\n020406080100120140160\\nFY07 FY08 FY09 FY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19% of Market Capitalization\\nFiscal Year 77 \\n International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Stan dards of Auditing as well as \\nlicense accountants and auditors  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish an Audit Committee to supervise companies’ internal controls, accounting policies, and \\ncompliance with IAS  \\n \\nIn addition to these actions, developing an organized investor base through a robust mutual fund industry \\nwill require going beyond what has been done so far and observe how the sector responds to the steps \\nalready taken. For longer -term growth of the stock market, making the playing field even by requiring ICB \\nfunds to be fully c ompliant with all mutual fund regulations will be important.  \\n3.5.5 Strategies for Insurance Sector  \\nInsurance sector is a significant part of the financial sector in all countries of the world. This sector protects \\nlife and asset of mass people and also con tributes to the economic growth of developed and underdeveloped \\ncountries. There is great scope for the development of insurance industry in Bangladesh. The strategies for \\nthe insurance sector during the 8th Five Year plan will be as follows:  \\na) All the insu rers will open actuarial department in their companies and to give financial assistance \\nto the actuarial students. IDRA and Bangladesh Insurance Association will create a fund to provide \\nfinancial assistance to meritorious students of actuarial science.  \\nb) IDRA will develop a framework to store all the policy related data in a digital policy repository \\ncalled Unified Messaging Platform. It will not only digitalize the information but also help IDRA \\nto analyze insurance related data. It will also develop a comm unication system between the policy -\\nholders and IDRA by sending SMS and e -mail. Through this platform, e -KYC, payment gateway, \\ne-receipt service will be provided in phases. Thus it will help to reduce money laundering and \\nfraudulent activity by fake insura nce agents. It will also help to control illegal commission business \\nof insurance companies.  \\nc) Government will introduce public health insurance to ensure health care for all the citizens. With \\nthe proceeds from the health insurance premium, the government w ill be able to develop hospitals \\nin the public -private sector to provide quality health care service to the general public.  \\nd) Both the Government and the employer will take measures to introduce the insurance for workers \\nto cover accidental injuries and dea ths at workplace.  \\ne) Public and private high rise buildings which are being commercially used or rented need to be \\nbrought under mandatory insurance coverage.  \\nf) Measures will be taken to strengthen capacity of IDRA and other insurance related institutions.  \\n3.6 RISKS AND UNCERTAINITIES  \\nThe macroeconomic outlook presented in this Chapter has significant downside risks associated with \\ndevelopments and factors of domestic and external origins. The adverse effects of COVID -19 reinforce the \\nimportance of managing these r isks deftly and on time.    78 \\n On the domestic front, the key challenge is realization of the investment target and mobilizing public sector \\nresources for implementing the important health and social protection projects to improve human health \\nand resilience a nd to build infrastructure and Delta Plan related water projects to strengthen growth and \\nresilience from natural disasters. Bangladesh has huge potentials to attract FDI from a wide range of \\ncountries. Bangladesh must also diversify its export base and im prove labour skills and productivity to \\nsustain growth momentum and provide good jobs. Private investment enhancement in manufacturing, in a \\nbalanced mix of domestic and FDI -based investments will be key.  Along with prudent macroeconomic \\nmanagement that k eeps inflation low, maintains a competitive real exchange rate, and keeps real interest \\nrate in line with the marginal productivity of capital, a big push to improving the investment climate will \\nbe essential. Without these reforms, the ability to mobilize  domestic investment and FDI in the projected \\namount will not materialize.  On the domestic financing side, the banking and capital market reforms are \\nalso essential.  Banking reforms are critical to lower the spread between deposit and lending rates and \\nenable the maintenance of positive real interest rates for deposit mobilization while keeping real lending \\nrates in line with marginal productivity of capital.  \\nWhile the size of public investment is planned to expand further, ensuring the efficiency gains through \\nquality of investment will be a major challenge in the face of continuing governance problems. \\nTransparency in tendering process and ensuring quality at different phases of project implementation, and \\nmaking contractors responsible even after the d elivery of projects will be key to ensuring quality of project \\nimplementation. Resource mobilization by the public sector will continue to remain a major challenge and \\nwill require steadfast implementation of tax policy reforms (in both VAT and direct tax fronts), \\nmodernization of tax administration, and reform of the NBR tax administration. There are also exogenous \\nrisks like a resurgence of a COVID -19 type pandemic, cyclone and flood, which may set back the progress \\non the Plan by diverting resources and attention of the policymakers away from Plan implementation.  \\nManagement of these risks requires active policy responses including a major increase in public healthcare \\nand implementation of the BDP2100.  \\nAs in the past, external factors will also continue  to influence the overall macroeconomic outlook in \\nBangladesh over the Plan period. Some relevant external risk factors include:  \\n\\uf0b7 The pace of global recovery to the COVID -19 pandemic.  \\n\\uf0b7 Uncertainties about petroleum prices in the global economy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Uncertaintie s about non -oil commodity prices, which are currently at their relatively low levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 The US -China trade war and generally weak relations that could escalate into a disruption of global \\ntrade reforms, capital flows and economic cooperation  \\n\\uf0b7 Slowdown of the RMG global market  \\n \\nThe Government will remain vigilant about the emerging external and domestic risks, and will continue to \\npursue prudent macroeconomic management and accelerate the pace of economic reforms as envisaged \\nunder the Plan. The Government is a lso committed to undertake corrective actions and policy adjustments \\nto mitigate the adverse effect of any unforeseen developments such as the COVID -19 pandemic.  \\nThe macroeconomic framework outlined above is appropriately challenging but at the same time attainable. \\nActual outcomes will depend on various developments of economic and noneconomic nature, and not all \\nfuture developments are within the control of the Government. Important lessons have been learned through  79 \\n the implementation of the Sixth and th e Seventh Plans, including the fact that growing revenue constraints \\nand risks in the banking sector need urgent resolution.  The COVID -19 pandemic reinforced the importance \\nof human health and well -being as the source of all development achievements.  It also exposed the \\nunderlying shortcomings in the Bangladesh health care and social security systems.  The 8FYP will put \\ntopmost priority in allocating adequate resources to healthcare and social protection and to address the \\nrelated planning and program imp lementation constraints.  Renewed efforts will be made to strengthen \\nimplementation of the NSSS.  As the size of the public investment grows, the importance of quality of \\nspending will become all the more important for economic efficiency. Mobilization of resources, \\nparticularly with greater focus on sustainable increase in NBR tax revenue, will be essential for financing \\nthe Plan as discussed in Chapter 5 of this part of the plan document. Overall, the 8.5% growth target by the \\nend of the 8th Plan should b e attainable, provided necessary supportive reforms and policies are put in place \\nfor the private sector to come forward and invest in the future of Bangladesh.  \\n   80 \\n CHAPTER 3: ANNEX TABLES  \\nTable A3.1: Bangladesh: Real Sector Performance, FY2019 -FY2025  \\nFisca l Year  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25

capita incomes, Bangladesh has made tremendous progress in reducing poverty. This \\nprogress has accelerated since 2000. In the 1970s, the poverty incidence was hovering in the 80% range. \\nBy 2016, the poverty incidence had fallen to 24.3%. Although new  Household Income and Expenditure \\nSurvey (HIES) data since 2016 is not available, the acceleration of GDP growth and other indicators of \\ndevelopment progress suggest that poverty has fallen further over the first 4 years of the 7FYP period. \\nPoverty is esti mated to have been reduced to 20.5% in FY2019. Progress with the reduction of extreme \\npoverty is similarly encouraging.  The incidence of extreme poverty is estimated to have fallen from 12.9% \\nin 2016 to 10.5% in FY2019. This result lays the basis for the target in the PP2041 to eliminate extreme \\npoverty by FY2031.  The progress in poverty reduction is similarly fully consistent with the SDG target of \\neliminating extreme poverty by 2030.   \\nThe onset of COVID -19 in March 2020 has temporarily disrupted the po verty reduction progress by \\ncreating considerable unemployment and loss of income. While the government has responded by \\nincreasing safety net transfers including free and subsidized food distribution during the lockdown, the \\nshort -term adverse effects of COVID -19 and the associated disruption of economic activity has hurt \\nseverely the employments and incomes of the urban poor and the near -poor, many of whom may have \\nslipped into poverty. The COVID -19 short -term poverty spike is temporary development and sh ould not \\ntake away the progress made in poverty reduction during the 7FYP prior to COVID -19. The underlying \\nstrategy should also be relevant for poverty reduction during the 8FYP and beyond, although some elements \\nof the poverty reduction strategy relating  to health care, social protection, reduction of vulnerability to \\nclimate change and natural disasters, and non -farm job creation may need to be further strengthened.           \\nAlong with poverty reduction, the Government is also mindful of the need to pay  attention to income \\ninequality, consistent with its commitment to reduce income inequality as laid down in SDG goal 10 and \\nemphasized in PP2041.To protect the incomes of the poor and vulnerable, the Government is placing greater \\nattention on inclusive dev elopment and social protection. In addition to personal income inequality, the \\nGovernment is also concerned about the disparity in the distribution of poverty and income across the \\nregions a nd districts of Bangladesh. The HIES  2016  shows that there is a wi de disparity in the distribution \\nof poverty across regions and districts. The analysis shows that these disparities prevail because of unequal \\nopportunities to access high income and employment options. Public policy interventions are required to \\nreduce bo th personal income inequality and disparities across regions and districts.   \\nThis chapter reviews the progress with poverty reduction at the national level as well as at the district level. \\nTo distinguish between the medium -to-long term poverty reduction strategy from the COVID -19 induced \\nshort -term poverty challenges, the analysis looks at the 7FYP poverty performance based on the progress \\nmade in the first four years of the 7FYP (FY2016 -FY2019) before COVID -19 struck. The poverty \\nimplications of COVID -19 and required policy response to address this spike are discussed separately.     88 \\n The chapter also looks at the issue of income inequality at the national level. Income data at the district \\nlevel is not available to talk meaningfully about income inequality  by districts. However, disparities in \\npoverty reduction and the location of extreme poverty give a good sense of which are the poorest districts \\nand the concentration of pockets of poverty that require public policy attention, especially to achieve the \\ntarget for eliminating extreme poverty by FY2031 as envisaged under SDG -1 and PP2041.   \\nThe analysis in this chapter provides a review of the progress made on poverty reduction and income \\ninequality during the Seventh Plan, looks at the impact of COVID -19, a nd sets the stage for developing the \\nrespective targets and strategies for the Eighth Plan keeping in view the targets set in the SDG -1, SDG 10 \\nand PP2041 and the special short -term challenges posed by COVID -19. Issues relating to social protection \\nand so cial inclusion that are also key elements of the poverty reduction and income inequality strategy are \\ndiscussed in detail in chapter 14, part 2 of the 8FYP document.  However, parts of that analysis that are \\nrelevant to the exposition of this chapter are b rought in where necessary.  \\nThe focus of this chapter is on income/ consumption dimensions of poverty and inequality.  The government \\nunderstands that poverty is multi -dimensional and progress with other indicators of well -being related to \\nhealth, educatio n, nutrition, social security, water supply, sanitation, housing, etc. are also very important.  \\nSDG - 1 places emphasis on the multi -dimensional nature of poverty and deprivations and the need to end \\nthose deprivations.  Progress on these aspects of nation al wellbeing are a part of the government’s broader \\napproach to poverty reduction and improved national welfare.  These issues are analysed in detail in Part 2 \\nof the report (e.g. chapter 9 deals with health and nutrition issues; chapter 10 on education an d training \\naspects; chapter 11 on water supply, sanitation and housing issues; and chapter 14 on social inclusion, social \\nprotection, women empowerment, food security and disaster management).  \\n4.2 PROGRESS WITH POVERTY REDUCTION  \\n4.2.1  Past Progress with Pover ty Reduction  \\nBangladesh experienced a uniform and steady decline in poverty rates from 2000 to 2016. The incidence \\nof poverty rate halved, falling from 48.9% in 2000 to 24.3% in 2016, which constitutes an impressive \\naverage decline of 1.54 percentage poin ts per year. Extreme poverty came down from 34.3% to 12.9% over \\nthe same periods, thereby registering an annual average reduction of 1.34 percentage points over the same \\nperiods (Table 4.1). As a result of these achievements, the number of poor fell from 6 2.8 million in 2000 \\nto 39.1 million in 2016, while the number of extreme poor fell from 44 million to 20.7 million over the \\nsame periods (Figure 4.1).  \\nTable 4.1:  Past Progress with Poverty Reduction 2000 -2016 (%)  \\n Poverty (upper poverty line)  Extreme Pov erty (lower poverty line)  \\n 2000  2005  2010  2016  2000  2005  2010  2016  \\nNational  48.9 40.0 31.5 24.3 34.3 25.1 17.6 12.9 \\nUrban  35.2 28.4 21.3 18.9 19.9 14.6 7.7 7.6  \\nRural  52.3 43.8 35.2 26.4 37.9 28.8 21.1 14.9  \\n \\nSource: BBS, HIES (2000, 2005, 2010, 2016)  \\n  89 \\n Figure 4.1: Number of Poor People (millions)  \\n \\n                         Source: Table 4.1 and Population Data from BBS  \\nWhile poverty declined in both rural and urban areas, the pace of decline was faster for rural poverty. As a \\nresult, the gap between ru ral and urban poverty rates has narrowed substantially over time. Thus, the rural \\npoverty rate was 52.3% in 2000, while the urban poverty rate was 35.1%, yielding a poverty gap of 17.2 \\npercentage points. This gap was reduced to only 7.5 percentage points b y 2016, with rural poverty falling \\nto 26.4% and urban poverty to 18.9%.  There was a similar reduction for extreme poverty.   \\n4.2.2  Factors That Helped Achieve Poverty Results Outcome  \\nDetailed research and analysis of the poverty outcomes over the 2000 -2016 periods yield some very useful \\ninsights about the determinants of poverty reduction in Bangladesh. For analytical purposes, it is useful to \\nbreak down the experience into two distinct phases: poverty reduction during 2000 -2010 and poverty \\nreduction duri ng 2010 -2016.  \\nGrowth, sectoral transformation, and employment creation:  First and foremost, there is consensus that \\nGDP growth and its composition are the two most important drivers of poverty reduction for both phases.  \\nPer capita GDP grew rapidly and th e structure of the economy improved in both periods (Table 4.2). But \\nthere is a major difference in employment outcomes over the two periods.  On average, the Bangladesh \\neconomy created many more jobs during 2000 -2010 as compared with 2010 -16. This was tru e for all \\nsectors, including agriculture. So, even as agriculture’s GDP and employment shares were falling, \\nagriculture continued to create new jobs during 2000 -2010, whereas during 2010 -2016, agriculture \\nemployment fell. Most importantly, industrial and s ervices employment surged during 2000 -2010, yielding \\ntotal job creation by an average of 2.5 million jobs as compared with only 0.9 million during 2010 -16. \\n \\n \\n 62.8 62.8\\n55.1\\n46.6\\n39.144.0 44.0\\n34.6\\n26.0\\n20.7\\n0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.0\\n2000 2000 2005 2010 2016 Poor Extreme Poor 90 \\n Table 4.2:  Growth, Structural Change and Employment 2000 -2016  \\nTime period  Per \\ncapita \\nGDP  \\n(%) GDP  share \\nof \\nagriculture  \\n(%) GDP \\nshare of \\nindustry  \\n(%) GDP \\nshare of \\nservices  \\n(%) Job \\ncreation in \\nagriculture  \\n(million)  Job \\nCreation \\nin \\nindustry  \\n(million)  Job \\ncreation \\nin \\nservices  \\n(million)  Job \\ncreation \\nper year  \\n(million)  \\n2000   \\n25 25 50     \\n2000 -2010  4.4 18 27 55 5.9 4.4 4.8 2.5 \\n2010 -2016  5.1 15 30 55 -0.3 2.7 3.1 0.9 \\nSource: GED estimates based on BBS data on National Accounts and LFS various years  \\nBecause of these differential effects, the poverty rate fell faster during 2000 -2010 than during 2010 -2016.  \\nThus, the average yearly reduction in moderate poverty was 1.74 percentage points per year during the \\nyears 2000 -2010, while it fell to 1.2 percentage points in 2010 -2016. The differential poverty response is \\neven more striking for extreme poverty. The ave rage yearly reduction in extreme poverty was 1.67 \\npercentage points during 2000 -2010 and only 0.78 in 2010 -2016 (Figure 4.2).  Regarding rural versus urban, \\nrural poverty reduced at a faster pace than urban poverty in both periods. However, rural poverty f ell faster \\nduring 2000 -2010. Importantly, urban poverty reduction stagnated in 2010 -2016.  \\nFigure 4.2: Annual Percentage Point Decline in Poverty  \\n \\n                       Source: GED estimates Using HIES data  \\nDecomposition analysis shows that agriculture b enefitted from steady growth in farm income as well as an \\nincrease in non -farm employment. The growth in non -farm employment was particularly rapid in 2000 -\\n2010 (Figure 4.3). Farm income benefitted from both a healthy agricultural sector GDP growth as well  as \\nan increase in rice prices. Along with the creation of many non -farm jobs, it tightened the agricultural labour \\nmarket and increased real wages in agriculture. Non -farm employment expansion and real wage increases \\nbenefitted the rural poor considerably , causing a sharp decline in poverty.  Although the pace of rural non -\\nfarm employment slowed in 2010 -2016, it was mainly due to a sharp reduction in rural labour supply \\n(Figure 4.3).  Rural employment growth kept pace with the growth in labour supply.  1.741.711.391.671.681.23\\n1.21.50.40.81.00.0\\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2Poverty nationalPoverty Rural Poverty urbanExtreme poverty nationalExtreme poverty ruralExtreme poverty urban2010-2016 2000-2010 91 \\n Figu re 4.3: Rate of Growth of Rural Employment 2000 -2016 (% per year)  \\n \\n                    Source: Labo ur Force Surveys, Various Years  \\nFigure 4.4:  Growth Rate of Labour Force (% per year)  \\n \\n                   Source: Labour Force Surveys Various Years  \\nThe su bstantial change in the employment structure of the rural economy, which also reflects the major \\nreduction in the GDP share of agriculture, is illustrated in Figure 4.4. This is a major indication of the \\nongoing rural transformation where agriculture value -added and employment are shrinking and giving way \\nto a growing non -farm economy. This rural transformation has played a major role in poverty reduction. \\nWithdrawal of labour from agriculture, which is often regarded as infested with surplus labour and the refore \\nsuffering from disguised unemployment, has been a major positive development in the rural transformation \\nof Bangladesh. This has raised average labour productivity in agriculture and increased farm wages. \\nEmployment in nonfarm activities has created  welcome opportunities for higher -income jobs for rural non -\\nfarm workers since wages and income typically tend to be higher in non -farm activities (Figure 4.5).   \\n \\n 2.0\\n0.05.1\\n1.93.2\\n0.9\\n0123456\\n2000-2010 2010-2016Farm Off-Farm Total\\n6.3\\n5.55.7\\n5.1\\n0.91.9\\n0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.0\\nUrban Rural Total2000-2010 2010-2016 92 \\n Figure 4.5: Rural Employment Structure 2000 -2016 (%)  \\n                    \\n                       Source: Labour Force Surveys Various Years  \\nFigure 4.6: Real Wages in Rural Areas (Taka/day 2016 prices)  \\n                    \\n                      Source: HIES 2010 and 2016  \\nThe pace of job expansion in urban areas was much faster than in rural area s, which was instrumental in \\nhelping absorb the rapid increase in the urban labour force owing to internal migration. This was true for \\nboth 2000 -2010 and 2010 -2016. The urban poor benefitted most from the expansion of manufacturing jobs, \\nespecially in RMG , and in construction. This was the most important determinant of the reduction in urban \\npoverty.  Between 2000 and 2016, the RMG sector created some 2.4 million jobs, mostly low -skilled female \\nworkers. The construction sector also created another 1.1 mill ion jobs, in urban areas. This rapid growth of \\nindustrial employment was the most important determinant of urban poverty reduction during 2000 -2016. \\nThe services sector, which is the largest source of urban employment, created an additional 4.2 million job s. \\nHowever, these are mostly informal in nature and the earnings vary considerably depending upon the \\nparticular service.   \\n 6258.354.651.7\\n7.7 8.5 10.1 11.3\\n1.64 4.5 5.728.7 29.2 30.8 31.3\\n010203040506070\\n2000 2005 2010 2016Agriculture Manufacturing Construction Services\\n187264\\n219338\\n050100150200250300350400\\n2010 2016Rural Agriculture Rural Non-farm 93 \\n Figure 4.7: Employment Growth in Urban, 2000 -2016  \\n \\n                 Source: Labour Force Surveys 2000, 2010, 2016 -17 \\nDespite the s urge in the urban labour force, the urban labour market generally remained favourable for most \\nof the urban poor.

This has radically changed the rural landscape through the \\ninjection of large income tran sfers. This has not only supported the growth of rural transport but also health \\nand education services. A part of the outflow of agricultural labour has fed into the migrant labour market, \\nalthough the bulk has gone to non -farm employment in rural and urb an areas. HIES data suggest that the \\ndistribution of remittances favours more the non -poor households. Additionally, the percentage of \\nhouseholds in the bottom 40% benefiting from remittances has fallen from 4.1% in 2010 to 2.3% in 2016. \\nYet, remittance in flows have contributed substantially to poverty reduction by financing consumption \\nincreases for this bottom 40% of households that have access to international remittances and more \\nimportantly by contributing to the growth of non -farm rural employment. Th e slowdown in remittance \\ninflows during 2013 -16 (Figure 4.10) and the reduction in the bottom 40% households’ access to \\nremittances in 2016 are likely to have contributed to the slower pace of poverty reduction in 2016 compared \\nwith 2010.  \\n 223189225254273253382832875\\n475\\n391568\\n409425556758\\n596\\n01002003004005006007008009001000\\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\\n2.02.12.93.23.64.35.56.69.010.7 11.012.214.2 13.814.9 15.2\\n13.6\\n0246810121416\\n1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 95 \\n Access to micro credits:  The government’s programme to expand access to microcredits is another factor \\nthat has helped reduce poverty. The scale and outreach of microcredits have continued to expand with a \\npositive impact on poverty reduction through the financing of mic ro enterprises that support off -farm job \\ncreation, smoothing of consumption and the build -up of assets (Table 4.3).  The high cost of microcredit \\nhowever remains a concern and efforts are needed to lower the cost. While interest costs are on average \\nmuch l ower than what private money -lenders charge in rural areas, they range between 20 -24%, which are \\nmuch higher than charged by commercial banks. Interest costs can be lowered by improving competition \\nin the supply of microcredit, providing more funding to su ppliers from public sources, and increasing the \\nsaving of the rural community that are members of the microcredit suppliers. Better use of technology can \\nalso help to reduce delivery cost of microcredits. On the demand side, the productivity of the use of \\nmicrocredit can be enhanced through better training, knowledge, and technology transfer to the borrowers. \\nAlready, the use of ICT through smartphones is improving market information and lowering transaction \\ncosts. These solutions will be further strengthen ed in the 8FYP.    \\nTable 4.3: Access to Microcredit  \\nDisbursement of Microcredit  2005  2010  2016  \\nMicrocredit disbursement (Tk billion)  132 372 787 \\nMicrocredit disbursement (Tk billion) (2005 prices)  132 263 358 \\nNumber of borrowers (million)  13.9 27.2 23.2 \\nNumber of poor households (million)  11.5 10.4 9.7 \\nReal microcredit/ poor household (000)  12 25 37 \\nSource: GED estimates based on microcredit data from Microcredit Regulatory Authority  \\nAccess to social protection schemes:  Bangladesh has an elaborate sy stem of social protection schemes, \\nmostly targeted to the rural poor.

This is a positive \\ndevelopment. Instituting a better system of transferring social protection spending to the poor in order to \\nincrease its poverty reduction impact is a major challenge that  will need to be addressed in the 8FYP. \\nTargeting issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 14, Part 2.   \\nFigure 4.11: Percentage of Households Receiving Social Protection Transfers  \\n \\n                  Source: HIES 2010 and 2016  33.2\\n24.629.1 28.7\\n05101520253035\\nBottom 40% All2010 2016 96 \\n Special Initiatives of Hon ’ble Prime Minister: The Hon\\'ble Prime Minister has designed 10 special \\ninitiatives with effort to building a middle income country free of poverty and hunger by 2021 and a \\ndeveloped country by 2041.

As a result of this initiative, the number of low \\nincome families in the project area has been reduced from 15% to 3%. The aim of this project is to reduce the \\npoverty rate to 8 percent by 2021 by enrolling 10 million families living below the current poverty l ine into the \\nproject.  \\nAshrayan Project  with the government allocation of Tk. 1160 Crore in the first phase aims to provide 65,726unit \\nhouse along with 2 decimal land to the landless and homeless families, on the occasion of Mujib centenary.

First, while GDP growth accelerated \\nduring 2010 -2016, the rate of reduction of poverty slowed down for both povert y and extreme poverty. This \\nsuggests that the growth elasticity of poverty (GEP) has fallen.  The results are shown in Table 4.4. The \\nGEP has been relatively stable between 2000 and 2010 but has fallen significantly during 2010 -2016.  The \\nreduction in elas ticity is large for extreme poverty for 2010 -16.   \\nTable 4.4: Growth Elasticity of Poverty  \\nPercentage per annum  2000 -2005  2005 -2010  2010 -16 \\nAverage per capita GDP growth  4 4.8 5.1 \\nAverage reduction in poverty  (-) 3.94  (-) 4.67  (-) 4.11  \\nAverage reductio n in extreme poverty  (-) 6.05  (-) 6.85  (-) 5.06  \\nGrowth elasticity of poverty  (-) 0.985  (-) 0.973  (-) 0.806  \\nGrowth elasticity of extreme poverty  (-)1.51  (-)1.43  (-) 0.992  \\nSource: GED estimates using BBS HIES and National Accounts Data  \\nThe policy implicat ion of this low progress in the poverty reduction strategy can be gauged by looking at \\nthe potential poverty reduction if growth elasticity had remained at the 2005 -2010 level (Figure 4.12).  Thus, \\npotential poverty incidence would have been 0.9 percentage  points lower for moderate poverty and 1.4 \\npercentage points lower for extreme poverty.  This suggests that securing higher per capita income growth \\nalone will not be enough. The policy must also be directed to ensure that growth is much more pro -poor \\nand inclusive. From the analysis above, this requires greater attention to higher farm incomes through farm \\ndiversification and productivity improvements. Rural non -farm and urban job creation focused on the \\nindustrial sector, improving access of poor househol ds to international migration opportunities, and higher \\npublic spending on social protection along with better access of poor households to these transfers are \\nneeded.  \\nFigure 4.12: 2016 Poverty Incidence with Unchanged Poverty Elasticity  \\n \\n                      Source: GED estimates  24.3\\n12.923.6\\n11.5\\n051015202530\\nPoverty Extreme PovertyActual Simulated 98 \\n Secondly, after falling dramatically during 2000 -2010, urban poverty progress stagnated in 2016. This is \\npossibly partly explained by the explicit inclusion of the slum population in the 2016 HIES. This may also \\nreflect the rel ative absence of social security programmes in urban areas. The government’s emphasis on \\nrural poverty is well placed given the continued concentration of the poor in rural areas. Yet, because of \\ncontinued strong outmigration from rural areas into urban ar eas, there is a need to give greater attention to \\nurban poverty. The importance of job creation in manufacturing and construction is particularly important \\nfor urban poverty reduction. Additionally, income transfers through better access to social protecti on \\nbenefits for the urban poor are very important.  \\nThirdly, there has been an increasing concentration of population just above the moderate poverty line \\nsuggesting an increase in vulnerability to shocks. The experience with COVID -19 illustrates this. Eve n \\nbefore COVID -19 emerged, the vulnerable population defined as population whose consumption basket \\nfalls within 1.25 times the poverty line increased sharply and was much higher than in 2010. This happened \\nbecause consumption growth became more unequal. F rom 2005 to 2010, consumption growth was highest \\namong the poorer households. Thus, the average consumption growth of the bottom 40% was 1.8% between \\n2005 and 2010 as compared with average consumption growth of 1.4% for all households. This reversed in \\n2016 when poorer households (bottom 40%) experienced an average consumption growth of only 1.2% as \\ncompared with 1.6% for all household.  \\n4.2.4  Poverty Reduction Progress during the Seventh Plan  \\nThe Seventh Plan sought to reduce moderate poverty from 24.8% in  2015 to 18.6% by 2020 and extreme \\npoverty from 12.9% to 8.9% over the same periods. The last Household Income and Expenditure Survey \\n(HIES) was done in 2016. No further survey was done since then. However, BBS estimated poverty \\nincidence for 2017 and 2018 . For 2019, poverty is estimated by using the growth elasticity of poverty for \\n2010 -16. This assumes an unchanged consumption -GDP relationship and unchanged income distribution. \\nThe projected decline in poverty over the last 4 years of the 7FYP is shown in  Table 4.5. The incidence of \\npoverty and extreme poverty both exhibit considerable reduction.  The results also track the 7FYP target \\nfor poverty reduction fairly well. So, on the whole, the poverty performance of the 7FYP during the first \\nfour years was c ommendable.  \\nTable 4.5: Reduction in Poverty during the Seventh Plan Period  \\nYear  Moderate Poor (%)  Extreme Poor (%)  \\n 7FYP  Actual /Estimated  7FYP  Actual/ Estimated  \\n2016  23.5 24.3 12.1 12.9 \\n2017  22.3 23.1 11.2 12.1 \\n2018  21.0 21.8 10.4 11.3 \\n2019  19.8 20.5 9.7 10.5 \\nSource: BBS for 2016 -2018.

But the ongoing structural change \\nwhereby the share of manufacturing and other industrial activities, especially construction, increased while \\nthe GDP share of agriculture fell, did not benefit poverty reduction as much as was expected owing to the \\nslowdown in employment in manufacturing. As evidenced from the past experience w ith poverty reduction \\ndescribed above (Section 4.2.2), non -farm job creation in rural areas and job creation in manufacturing and  99 \\n construction were the major sources of poverty reduction. This slowdown during the 7FYP hurt the urban \\npoor particularly becau se the employment in the RMG sector, which has been a driver of urban poverty \\nreduction in the 2000 -2013 periods, stagnated since 2013 with almost zero growth since then. Low -skilled \\nurban female workers were the main beneficiary of this boom in urban empl oyment between 2000 and \\n2013.  Employment also slowed in construction, which has been an important source of poverty reduction \\nfor both urban and rural poor. The slow -down in employment in both RMG and construction despite rapid \\ngrowth in respective value -added is largely explained by the greater adoption of better technology and high \\ncapital -intensive means of production. The low skill base of the urban and rural poor puts them at a great \\ndisadvantage in benefitting from GDP growth in the urban areas owing  to the onset of the Fourth Industrial \\nRevolution (4IR). This is an issue that will require large policy attention during the 8FYP.  \\nAs against the slower growth of domestic employment, a positive factor for poverty reduction in the 7FYP \\nwas the growth in external migrant employment and remittances (Figure 4.13). Along with the expansion \\nof the higher -than-planned uptake of migrant workers, the growth of remittance inflows that showed a \\ndownward trend in FY2013 -FY2016, turn -around sharply during FY2017 -FY20 20 providing a very strong \\nimpulse to income flows to the beneficiaries of remittance income. This was supported by government \\npolicies to increase the outflow of migrant labour through diplomacy and policy dialogue with governments \\nof receiving countries,  better information at the district level on migration opportunities, training to \\npotential migrants, and a special incentive to attract remittance through the banking system.  \\nFigure 4.13: Migrant Labour Outflows during 7FYP (million workers)  \\n \\n                Source 7FYP and Bangladesh Bank  \\nThe 7FYP poverty reduction strategy continued to expand access to microcredits.  Both the volume of credit \\nand the number of borrowers expanded rapidly. The real value of microcredit disbursements grew at an \\nimpressive annual pace of 14%, which is substantially faster than during 2005 -2016 (9.5%). The number \\nof borrowers also grew at a faster pace (8% as compared with 5%).  This was supported by the Microcredit \\nRegulatory Authority (MRA) efforts to facilitate as well as regulate microcredit flows through new licenses, \\nregulations to strengthen supervision, and weeding out inefficient or non -compliant suppliers. As of June \\n2019, some 724 licensed MFIs were in action. Greater competition access, service delivery, and some \\nreduction in cost. On the whole, progress on the microcredit front was a major positive development for \\npoverty reduction during the 7FYP.  23.5\\n00.511.522.533.54\\n7FYP Actual 100 \\n Table 4.6: Expansion of Microcredit during 7FYP  \\nDisbursement of Micro -credit  FY2015  FY2019  \\nMicrocredit disbursement (Tk billion)  634 1403  \\nMicrocredit disbursement (Tk billion) (2005 prices)  306 542 \\nNumber of borrowers (million)  20.4 28.4 \\nNumber of poor households (million)  9.5 8.2 \\nReal microcredit/ poor household (000)  32 63 \\nSource: GED estimates based on microcred it data from Microcredit Regulatory Authority  \\nRegarding social protection, the government’s emphasis remained in place. In 2015, the Government \\nadopted the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the \\nsocial p rotection system in Bangladesh.  Several reforms have been initiated to implement the NSSS. The \\nmost important one that has been completed and is now functioning is the establishment of the G2P System \\nled by the Finance Ministry. This reform is enabling di rect payments from the government to the \\nbeneficiaries through online transfers.  Other reforms are in the process to consolidate and convert multiple \\nprogrammes into the Life Cycle Framework suggested by the NSSS.  Steps are also being taken to convert \\nin-kind programmes to cash transfers to reduce leakages. Additionally, the amount of resources allocated \\nfor NSSS programmes as a percent of GDP has been falling owing to severe fiscal constraints. The \\ngovernment is taking stock of the progress with the impl ementation of the NSSS and intends to strengthen \\nimplementation during the 8FYP.  \\n4.2.5  Eighth Plan Strategy for Poverty Reduction  \\nThe solid progress in poverty reduction achieved during the Seventh Plan before COVID -19 happened \\nsuggests that the underlyin g poverty reduction strategy is broadly on the right track.  But some of the \\nconcerns about the pre -COVID -19 outcomes noted in section 4.2.3 combined with the effects of COVID -\\n19 suggest that several important changes will be necessary to strengthen the ro bustness of the poverty \\nreduction strategy.  \\nFirst, the reduction in poverty elasticity and the stagnation in poverty reduction in urban areas observed in \\n2016 suggests that stronger efforts are needed to make the growth much more pro -poor and inclusive as \\ndiscussed in chapter 2. This requires attention to the composition of GDP growth and its job creation \\npotential.  \\nSecond, the high concentration of near -poor close to the poverty line means that a large population is heavily \\nexposed to shocks like COVID -19. The resilience and stability of income need to be strengthened through \\nefforts to increase the real incomes of both the wage -employed workforce and the self -employed workforce, \\nand through a stronger system of income transfers to the poor and vulnerable based on a vastly strengthened \\nsocial protection system.  \\nThird, in the very short term, a large number of jobs will need to be created in the first year of the 8FYP to \\nabsorb the many domestic unemployed in the informal sector and those who are returning f rom overseas \\nfrom loss of jobs owing to COVID -19. Additionally, social protection spending will need to be increased \\nto offset the short -term increase in poverty.   101 \\n Finally, the PP2041 and SDG -01 objective of securing the target of elimination of extreme pov erty by \\nFY2031 requires special attention to social protection, health, education, and training focussed on the \\nextreme poor. The introduction of a Universal Health Care system financed through a combination of public \\nand private health insurance schemes i s of utmost importance in this regard.  \\n8FYP Targets for Poverty Reduction   \\nThe poverty reduction targets for the Eighth Plan are shown in Table 4.7. The poverty reduction targets \\ndepend upon both the growth rate of GDP and the pattern of consumption/income  distribution. It also \\ndepends upon how quickly the short -term spike in poverty acceleration owing to COVID -19 is reversed \\nand the poverty path is restored to the pre -COVID trend. The average growth rate projected for the Eighth \\nPlan is 8.0 percent per yea r. The projections assume that the government will adopt all policies including \\njob creation and income transfers to restore the COVID -19 infected poverty situation to the long -term \\npoverty reduction path of PP2041 by FY2022. This is the only way that Bang ladesh would be able to \\neliminate extreme poverty by FY2031. The sharp improvement in poverty elasticity of per capita GDP \\ngrowth shown in Table 4.7 assumes that significant efforts will be made to improve consumption \\ndistribution in favour of the poorest 40th percentile of the population to lift them at a faster pace out of \\npoverty and vulnerability than was possible during the 2010 -2020 periods. The associated poverty reduction \\nstrategy and the underlying policies to achieve these targets are discussed be low. These policies are drawn \\nfrom the lessons of experience with poverty reduction during the past two decades and especially during \\n2010 -2020.  \\nTable 4.7: Poverty Targets for the Eighth Plan  \\nIndicators  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nIncidence of Pove rty 23.0 20.0 18.5 17.0 15.6 \\nPoverty elasticity of growth    1.2 1.2 1.2 \\nPer capita GDP growth  6.1 6.5 6.8 7.1 7.3 \\nIncidence of Extreme Poverty  12.0 10.0 9.1 8.3 7.4 \\nPoverty elasticity of growth    1.4 1.4 1.4 \\nSource: GED Projection  \\nMain Elements of the  Poverty Reduction Strategy  \\nThe main elements of the Eighth Plan poverty reduction strategy are as follows:  \\nReversal of COVID -19 induced poverty: The highest and most immediate priority would be to reverse the \\nCOVID -19 shock -induced spike in poverty in Q2 of 2020 within the first two years of the 8FYP. Given the \\nlarge shock and the persistence of COVID -19 effects in the first half of FY2021, an 18 -month recovery \\nperiod seems reasonable. The poverty reduction support package will include sharply improving CO VID-\\n19 prevention and COVID -19 related healthcare spending to ensure the health safety of all workers and \\nfamilies to allow a return to normalcy; accelerating income transfers through the social protection \\nprogramme to those who remain affected by COVID -19, loss of income and/ or face COVID -19 related \\nhealth care spending shocks, providing  jobs to those who became unemployed from COVID -19 by \\naccelerating efforts to revive the Cottage , Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (CMSMEs)  through low -\\ncost credit sche mes, protecting jobs in the formal sector through the speedy implementation of the various  102 \\n stimulus packages announced by the government; supporting agriculture production and diversification \\nthrough a range of policies including access to inputs including  mechanized inputs, farm credit, marketing \\nsupport, price support through public procurement, and implementing rural works programme as needed.   \\nJob creation through growth and structural change.  The analysis of poverty progress over 2000 -2016 \\nprovided st rong supportive evidence that the fundamental determinant of poverty reduction over the long \\nterm is the acceleration of GDP growth that is combined with efforts to create jobs in manufacturing, \\nconstruction, and services. Growth projections for the 8FYP r eviewed in chapter 2 shows that the recovery \\nof GDP growth will be swift based on short -term stimulus -based policy responses and the implementation \\nof the government’s long -term growth strategy of PP2041. Thus, GDP growth is projected to recover to the \\nlong-term PP2041 postulated GDP growth path of 8 percent, reaching 8.5% by FY2025.  The GDP share \\nof agriculture will continue to fall, while the GDP shares of industry, especially manufacturing, and services \\nwill grow.  The manufacturing sector in particular  is projected to grow in double digits, thereby increasing \\nits GDP share from 25% in FY2020 to 31% in FY2025. This changing composition of production is \\nconducive to poverty reduction through better job creation in manufacturing.  However, the recently \\nobserved slow -down in employment in manufacturing in both urban and rural areas will have to be reversed \\nduring the 8FYP. The suggested strategy in Chapter 2 to boost the role of CMS MEs will be critical in \\ncreating manufacturing as well as other off -farm jobs . \\nEven as both the GDP and employment shares of agriculture fall, agriculture will remain important for food \\nsecurity and income of self -employed farmers, many of whom are poor. However, the creation of non -farm \\njobs in rural areas will be the main source of poverty reduction for rural wage workers since agriculture \\nwill continue to shed labour. Within agriculture, productivity improvements to raise yields, reduce \\nvulnerability to climate change, and greater diversification to non -crop agriculture, fishing,  livestock, and \\ndairy products will play important role in increasing income for the self -employed farmers and workers that \\nremain in farming. Therefore, the 8FYP will undertake investments in research and extension to increase \\ncrop productivity, especiall y rice, to support climate -resistant seed and production technology, invest in \\nwater resources to support farm production in drought -prone areas of the Barind region in the North -western \\nDistricts of Bangladesh and the CHT, ensure flood control and water -logging prevention investments, and \\ntake steps to prevent river -bank erosions and salinity inroads. These actions are all discussed in detail in the \\nBangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) and further elaborated in chapter 5 of part 2 dealing with \\nagriculture and water issues. Implementation of the BDP2100 is critical for lowering the vulnerability of \\nthe poorest districts of Bangladesh noted in Section 4.4 below.  \\nThe most fundamental challenge for job creation in the 8FYP that will have a telling effect on bot h rural \\nand urban poverty, but especially for urban poverty, is the pace and pattern of the manufacturing sector \\ngrowth. The observed slow -down of job creation in manufacturing and the sharp fall in the short -term \\nemployment elasticity in manufacturing dur ing 2013 -2016 -17 will be addressed comprehensively during \\nthe 8FYP to secure the poverty reduction targets. The main elements of the policy framework to spur the \\ngrowth of manufacturing value -added and employment is to promote the diversification of labour -intensive \\nexport -oriented manufacturing beyond RMG. Drawing on the lessons from the RMG success, policy \\nsupports for other labour -intensive manufacturing exports include a competitive real exchange rate, \\nreduction in trade protection to remove the anti -export bias of trade policy, improve infrastructure services, \\nand reduce the cost of trade logistics through deregulation, automation and transport links between the ports \\nand the factory -gate. Details of the manufacturing and trade policy reforms that will be pursued during the \\n8FYP are provided in chapter 2 of part 2 of the Plan document.       103 \\n Outside agriculture, the CMSEs are the largest sources of employment in a wide variety of urban and rural \\nenterprises in manufacturing and services. Employment in CMS Es is a mixed bag of self -employed, wage \\nemployed, and family labour. These enterprises are mostly informal in nature, have low capital intensity, \\nuse low -level technology, and involve small scale production. The manufacturing CMSEs have little or no \\nlinka ge to formal medium and large -scale manufacturing. Progress was made in sub -contracting \\narrangement with the formal RMG sector but over the years automation and consolidation in the formal \\nRMG have weakened this linkage. Lack of dynamism in the CMSEs is a major constraint to job creation \\nthat has been further hit hard by COVID -19. A major strategic shift in the 8FYP employment strategy is to \\nboost the CMSE sector through better access to bank financing and through one -stop support for \\ntechnology, training, marketing, and regulatory improvements based on converting the SME Foundation \\ninto an institution like the Small Business Association (SBA) of the USA. Additionally, bank and non -bank \\nfinancial institutions are reluctant to lend to CMSEs owing to higher ri sk perception, especially in terms of \\nstart-up financing. Adoption of a Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) can be very helpful to address this \\nconstraint.  \\nThe services sector has historically provided a strong value -added and employment cushion as the \\nproductio n structure changed over the years. Initially, the workers migrating from agriculture were mostly \\nabsorbed in a range of informal rural and urban services. Over the years, the emergence of RMG and \\nconstruction as major economic activities slowed this influ x in low -productivity and low -income informal \\nservices. Within services, there is a visible transformation with the growth of a variety of modern services \\nin transport, trade, finance, housing, tourism, education, and health. Much of this transformation ha s \\nhappened in the urban areas but with improved transport connectivity, electricity, and the spread of internet, \\nthe services activities are also getting modernized in services. The 8FYP will accelerate this transformation \\nof the services sector through su pport for access to credit, through the strengthening of ICT, and promotion \\nof ICT exports and skills upgrading through training.     \\nStrengthening education and training focused on the poor:  Development of human capital will be essential \\nto implement the  government’s inclusive growth strategy. As noted in chapter 1, despite progress the skills \\nconstraint is serious and requires further coordinated efforts focused on increasing education enrolments at \\nthe secondary level and above, improving the quality of  education, and strengthening training programmes \\nfor employable skills. As discussed in detail in chapter 10, Part 2, much greater efforts are needed to \\nimprove the equity of education and training services to enable the poor to participate better in the growth \\nprocess. Education and training are also the best means to reduce income inequality over the longer term. \\nThe 8FYP will focus strongly on the development of education and training, with emphasis on secondary \\nand tertiary enrolments, emphasis on qual ity, and special attention to improve the access of the poor to \\neducation and training. The details of education and training strategy are contained in chapter 10, Part 2.  \\nImplementation of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100): It is well -known that th e poverty and \\nvulnerability to natural hazards and climate change are inter -linked.  So, sustainable reduction in poverty \\nthat is related to natural hazards and climate change will require addressing these vulnerabilities at source.   \\nThe BDP2100 was prepa red with this as one core objective, in addition to others.  The adoption of BDP2100 \\nin September 2018 is a major milestone in strategy making in Bangladesh that explicitly addresses the \\nnatural hazard and climate change risks to development prospects for Bangladesh. The 8FYP is the first \\nphase of implementing the BDP2100.     104 \\n Promote job creation and income earnings from external migration:  The potential strong positive role of \\nexternal migration in reducing poverty will be better harnessed in the 8FYP, le arning from the experiences \\nof the 6th and 7th Plans.  The adverse effect of COVID -19 on overseas employment is expected to be \\ntemporary and global recovery is expected by the end of FY2021. The external migration strategy for \\npoverty reduction during the 8FYP consists of a number of inter -related policy actions: (i) strengthen \\ngovernment efforts to negotiate with existing and new potential labour - shortage host countries to export \\nBangladeshi workers; (ii) upgrade skill base of potential migrants through t raining; (iii) support \\noutmigration from the poorest districts of the Northwest part of Bangladesh that are not well served by \\naccess to external migration through better information flow and training;  (iv) find ways to reduce the cost \\nof out -migration th rough partnerships with job agencies that provide low -cost services; (v) provide access \\nto one -time credit to defray the cost of migration secured against future earnings based on a government \\nprogramme administered by commercial banks; (vi) provide inform ation and anti -exploitation services \\nthrough the embassies; (vii) ensure that the exchange rate for remittance through the banking system is \\ncompetitive with the curb market rates; and (viii) offer solid banking services to the migrant workers to \\nenable th e use of formal banking channels for sending remittances.  \\nContinued growth of microcredit services:   As noted earlier, progress with microcredit services has been a \\nmajor policy success in reducing poverty and supporting rural transformation.  This progres s will be \\nstrengthened in the 8FYP. The research will be done to find ways that the cost of microcredit can be brought \\ndown, especially through the use of digital technology that could help reduce the transaction cost of \\nborrowing, supervision, and repayme nts. An effort will also be made to bring some of the microcredit \\nborrowers into the fold of the normal banking channel.  \\nTowards a Universal Health Care System for Bangladesh: The onslaught of the COVID -19 epidemic \\nstrongly brought home the importance of instituting a universal health care system (UHC) as a major policy \\nintervention for reducing poverty, especially extreme poverty. The extreme poor are particularly prone to \\nshocks, particularly heath shocks. Time has come for Bangladesh to start on a pilot  basis some type of a \\nhealth insurance scheme. The Ministry of Health has already developed a long -term strategy for health \\nfinancing that includes health insurance. The implementation of this health financing strategy will be a \\nmajor priority during the E ighth Plan.  \\nStrengthening the implementation of NSSS:  A well thought out social protection strategy is extremely \\nimportant for supporting poverty reduction based on the above strategies and policies. While Bangladesh \\nhas a strong commitment and rich experi ence with implementing a wide range of social safety nets, there \\nare many concerns with the effectiveness and poverty focus of the safety net system. The experience of \\nCOVID -19 also exposed some of the inherent limitations of the present social protection system.  For the \\n8FYP, two major initiatives will be taken.  First, the implementation of the NSSS will be fast -tracked. All \\nefforts will be made to consolidate the multiple schemes into the core Life -Cycle risk -based programmes \\nsuggested in the NSSS, move  away from in -kind to cash -based transfers on -line transfers, establish Single \\nRegistry MIS of beneficiaries based on eligibility criteria identified in the NSSS, and establish an on -line \\nGrievance Redressal System.   Second, the financing of a reformed so cial protection system will be given \\na high priority.  This is built in the Fiscal Policy Framework of the 8FYP described in chapter 5 that allows \\nfor the increase in social protection spending (excluding civil service pensions that are not poverty -targete d) \\nas a share of GDP from 1.2% in FY2019 to 2.0% by FY2025.   105 \\n 4.2.6  Strategies to Address Extreme Poverty – Additional Measures  \\nReplication of the Micro Programme Successes in Eradicating Extreme Poverty:  Micro programme \\nsuccesses have been many and they ar e marked by diversity in approaches. There have been quite a few \\ntargeted livelihood programmes (e.g., EEP, CLP, TUP, etc.) that have been quite effective in combating a \\nmore difficult case of extreme poverty. A defining marker of many of these programmes is that they are \\naimed to provide consequential transfer of resources (assets or financial) to extremely poor clients. These \\ninterventions help develop/support asset management, savings habit, organizational, financial, and \\nmarketing skills, which are “non -tradable” and cannot be overnight developed by transfer of money alone. \\nThe aim should now be to replicate on a wider scale - and suitably modified where applicable - these \\nprogrammes to cover most extreme poor groups in the country to reduce extreme pove rty significantly in \\nthe 8FYP.  \\nUndertaking Measures for Preventing and Mitigating Shocks: The onslaught of COVID -19 is a stark \\nreminder of how shocks play a decisive role in shaping the pace of extreme poverty reduction. Most of the \\npoor and near -poor pop ulation have limited assets and other forms of saving instruments to cope with \\nshocks. A devastating and prolonged shock like COVID -19 can easily derail poverty progress. So, efforts \\nneed to be made to build up asset generation for the poor as well as prev enting asset erosion. As evidenced \\nby COVID -19, shocks make poor people poorer and turn the extreme poor into destitute. Although COVID -\\n19 is in the form of an unprecedented once -in-a-lifetime global shock, more regular socks through natural \\ndisasters and healthcare shocks are a regular phenomenon in Bangladesh.  Indeed, had there been no \\nslippages into poverty due to preventable shocks, Bangladesh would have experienced a much faster decline \\nin poverty and extreme poverty. So, shock prevention and risk red uction for the poor and the poorest in \\nparticular will, therefore, be given top policy priority in the Eighth Plan. As noted, two important risk \\nmitigation strategies that will be adopted in the 8FYP to minimize the effects of anticipated shocks include \\nthe reduction in climate change and natural disaster -related shocks by the implementation of the Bangladesh \\nDelta Plan BDP2100 and the introduction of Universal Health Care system.   \\nImproving the Regional Balance in Development  \\nThe evidence from successive HIES surveys shows that the distribution of poverty is highly uneven by \\nzillas and upazillas. There are some perennially poor zillas and upazillas that continue to suffer from poverty \\nand deprivation over a long period. Addressing the poverty challenges in  these backward regions will help \\nsecure the extreme poverty eradication challenge much more fruitfully than most other interventions. This \\nis a major task for the 8FYP. The details are discussed in the following section.  \\n4.2.7  Multidimensional Poverty Ind ex (MPI)  \\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for eradicating poverty in all its dimensions from the men, \\nwomen and children. Recognizing this multifarious nature of human poverty and deprivations, the \\ngovernment, during the  7th FYP, has taken ini tiative to develop the National Multidimensional Poverty \\nIndex (MPI) and linked Child Multidimensional Poverty Index (C -MPI) as a prelude to preparing a national \\nMPI for Bangladesh.  The MPI analysis will help the government to establish a robust baseline f or tracking \\nprogress in non - monetary poverty reduction over time and to identify and target the poorest areas or the \\npoorest sub -groups within those areas. Focusing on what is causing high levels of poverty, the indices will  106 \\n be used to develop interventio ns for specific areas or sub -groups to ensure they receive adequate and \\nappropriate social services to reduce their deprivations. It is expected that the fruitful realization of national \\nMPI and Child MPI during the 8th FYP would enable the government to f ight against non -monetary \\ndeprivations, which will reduce regional inequality and mainstream marginalized groups into the \\ndevelopment process. It is worth mentioning that MPI for Bangladesh has been decreased from 0.175 in \\n2014 to 0.101 in 2019, driven by decreases in both incidence (headcount) and intensity of poverty, \\naccording to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Report 2020. Whereas 37.6% of the total \\npopulation (58.0 million) was MPI poor in 2014, this proportion has been reduced to 24.1%  of people (39.2 \\nmillion) in 2019, meaning that 18.8 million people moved out of poverty during those years . \\n4.3 PROGRESS WITH REDUCING REGIONAL DISPARITIES  \\nBangladesh puts a strong emphasis on establishing a just and equitable society where there are opportun ities \\nfor all irrespective of race, religion, culture gender, or location. This is a tough challenge as inequalities are \\nknown to prevail across these various dimensions owing to differing initial conditions, factor endowments, \\nfactor mobility, and adminis trative weaknesses. Nevertheless, the government is committed to addressing \\nthese inequalities and ensure the equity of development through its various policies and development \\ninitiatives.  \\nIn the context of spatial administrative setup, Bangladesh is comp rised of 8 divisions and 64 districts. \\nDistricts are further sub -divided into sub -divisions (upazillas) and thanas. Unfortunately, updated income \\ndata is not available either by divisions or districts. As a result, it is not possible to see if there is pro gress \\nin achieving per capita income convergence among districts and regions.  However, HIES data provide a \\nunique opportunity to find out the location of the poor by district and regions, thereby providing a picture \\nof the lagging regions in terms of pove rty progress at the regional and district levels. This is very useful to \\nguide policy, especially in the allocation of public spending to reduce regional and district -level disparities.  \\n4.3.1  Regional Distribution of Poverty  \\nAn important objective of the Government is to ensure that poverty progress happens throughout the \\ncountry so that no region/district is left behind. This also has important implications for income inequality. \\nThe most fundamental result is that all regions have benefitted from develop ment efforts with sharp \\nreductions in poverty and extreme poverty (Table 4.8). The sharp reductions in poverty between 2000 and \\n2016 in the traditionally lagging regions of Khulna, Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Barisal are heartening \\nnews. Rangpur in particular  used to suffer from episodes of hunger and deprivation during the lean \\nagricultural months. This is now a matter of past and Rangpur secured more than 60% reduction in the \\nincidence of extreme poverty. Similar impressive reductions in extreme poverty have  happened in \\nMymensingh, Barisal, and Khulna. These lagging regions are typically much more heavily reliant on \\nagriculture and informal activities and also tend to suffer from a much more severe incidence of natural \\ndisas ters and climate change impact.  \\n   107 \\n Table 4.8: Regional Poverty Incidence (%)  \\nDivision  Poverty Rate  Extreme Poverty Rates   \\n2000  2005  2010  2016  2000  2005  2010  2016  \\nBarisal  53.1 52.0 39.4 26.4 34.7 35.6 26.7 14.4 \\nChattogram  45.7 34.0 26.2 18.3 27.5 16.1 13.1 9.0 \\nDhaka  42.3 27.7 25.8 16.7 30.6 16.1 11.3 7.4 \\nKhulna  45.1 45.7 32.1 27.7 32.2 31.6 15.4 12.1 \\nMymensingh  60.6 48.5 48.3 32.9 47.0 35.0 31.9 18.0 \\nRajshahi  45.1 45.7 32.1 27.7 32.2 31.6 15.4 12.1 \\nRangpur  60.6 48.5 48.3 32.9 47.0 35.0 31.9 18.0 \\nSylhet  42.4 33.8 28.1 16.2 26.7 20.8 20.7 11.5 \\nSource: World Bank Poverty Assessment 2019, Volume 2. Estimates based on HIES 2016.  \\nAlthough the sustained progress with regional poverty reduction is a very welcome news, one important \\nconcern is the regional disparities in poverty progress (Tabl e 4.8). The eastern regions of Bangladesh \\n(Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet divisions) tend to have a lower incidence of poverty than the western \\nregions (Khulna, Barisal, and Rajshahi).  Since there are differences in poverty outcomes within a Region, \\nthe sp atial disparities are much better reflected in the disaggregation of the poverty profile by districts.  This \\nis illustrated by comparing the poverty progress amongst the poorest 10 districts with the progress in the \\ntop 10 districts exhibiting the lowest p overty rate. This comparison would yield some useful insights about \\nwhat contributes to disparities in poverty outcomes by districts.  \\nFigure 4.14 shows the 10 poorest and the 10 least -poor districts as reflected in the results of the 2016 HIES. \\nSeveral rem arkable findings might be highlighted.  \\n\\uf0b7 The disparity in district -level poverty is large. The gap between the least poor district (Narayanganj) \\nand the poorest district (Kurigram) is a phenomenal 68 percentage points.  \\n\\uf0b7 All the top 10 least poor districts bel ong to the Eastern Regions of Bangladesh: 6 in Dhaka Division \\n(Narayanganj, Munshiganj, Gazipur, Madripur, Faridpur, and Dhaka); 2 in Chittagong Division \\n(Bhramanbaria, Feni); and 2 in Sylhet Division (Maulvibazar and Sylhet).  \\n\\uf0b7 The distribution of the poore st districts is more disparate, spreading all over the country, although \\nthere is a large concentration of these districts in the Western Division of Rangpur (Kurigram, \\nDinajpur, Gaibandha, Rangpur, and Lalmonirhat).  \\n\\uf0b7 The Chittagong Hill Tracts Area (CHT) e xhibits a large concentration of poor people, with two of \\nthe three districts of CHT showing poverty in the 53 -63 percent range, which is more than twice \\nthe national average.  \\n \\n \\n   108 \\n Figure 4.14: Top 10 Least Poor and Top 10 Poorest Districts 2016  \\n \\n        Source: HIES 2016, BBS  \\nAn important policy question is why are these 10 districts so poor and exhibit poverty rates that are \\nsubstantially above the national poverty rate.

Som e limited analysis done by putting together fragmented data from different sources \\nsuggests that by and large, these districts have the following characteristics:  \\n\\uf0b7 Tend to be dominated by agricultural activities with a dominance of landless labours, limited  \\nmanufacturing and construction activities relative to the more prosperous districts. In particular, non -\\nfarm rural employment opportunities are much more limited in these districts as compared with the \\nleast poor districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Suffer from more intense episod es of natural disasters and climate change, especially flooding and \\nriverbank erosions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Have weaker infrastructure facilities relative to the more prosperous districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Have much weaker access to international migration and income transfers relative to the  more \\nprosperous districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Have weaker urban centres than in the least poor districts.  \\n 7164635754535347444213111010887433\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80KurigramDinajpurBandarbanMaguraKishorganjKhagrachariJamalpurGaibandhaRangpurLalmonirhatSylhetMaulvibazarBrahmanbariaDhakaFeniFaridpurGazipurMadripurMunshiganjNarayanganj 109 \\n 4.3.2  8FYP Strategy for Addressing the Poverty Problems for the Lagging Regions  \\nThe above findings provide a very important basis for policy interventions in the 8FY P to alleviate poverty \\nin the poorest districts. The main interventions include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Refocusing ADP spending to improve the health, education, and infrastructure needs of the lagging \\ndistricts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Giving higher priority and greater beneficiary coverage of social protection programmes to the \\nlagging districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Prioritizing BDP2100 PIP in favour of addressing irrigation, flood control, waterlogging and \\nsalinity problems in the lagging districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of Char Development Board to address the vulnerabilities of Char area.  \\n\\uf0b7 Focussing agriculture research and extension services to help farm productivity and incomes in the \\nlagging districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Supporting the growth of non -farm rural enterprises in the lagging districts through focussed \\nsupport programmes including c redit, technology, and marketing services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide greater access to labour training to lagging districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve access of lagging districts to international migration through better information, training, \\nand credit support to meet the cost of overseas employment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance access to ICT services through the education system and special training programmes to \\nthe lagging districts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the LGIs working in the lagging districts through a higher share of block grants and \\ntraining.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen partnersh ip with NGOs and CBOs in delivering all relevant local services including \\nsocial security programmes.       \\n\\uf0b7 Conduct in -depth district -level poverty assessments for the top 10 poorest districts to do a more \\ndetailed and specific diagnostics of the fundament al constraints faced by these districts and tailoring \\npublic programme support to address those constraints.  \\n\\uf0b7 Require BBS to re -introduce district level GDP estimates to help understand the pattern of district \\nlevel income paths and whether convergence is h appening.  \\n \\n4.4 PROGRESS WITH INCOME INEQUALITY REDUCTION  \\nImplementation of the above poverty reduction strategy will be the most important element for containing \\nand eventually reducing income inequality. As noted in Chapter 2, Bangladesh has already stabiliz ed \\nconsumption inequality at around a Gini coefficient value 0.32, but income inequality has increased, \\nmeasured in terms of both the Gini coefficient and the Palma ratio.  The reduction of income inequality is \\na tough challenge and a long -term endeavour.  Growing economies like China and India are all experiencing \\nrising income inequality. Since assets and human capabilities are unequally distributed historically, the \\nbenefits of growth in the context of a market economy tend to favour those who have a bet ter endowment \\nof assets and human capabilities to start with. The long -term income inequality reduction strategy must, \\ntherefore, focus on reducing this initial gap. Human development strategy with an emphasis on alleviating \\nthe access gap for the poor is one powerful instrument. Facilitating asset accumulation through better access \\nto credit for the poor can help reduce income inequality. A better strategy for social inclusion by eliminating  110 \\n physical and social barriers is another important instrument. The  experience of Western Europe suggests \\nthat fiscal policy can be a very powerful instrument for the reduction of income inequality. This calls for \\nboth increased public spending on social sectors (health, education, sanitation, water supply, and social \\nprotection) and very importantly a well -designed personal income tax system that taxes all sources of \\nincome at a progressive rate.  \\n4.4.1  Strategy for Better Income Distribution  \\na. Strengthening Land Management  \\nThe poor usually have very little physical or fina ncial assets. Those who are amongst the fortunate few have \\nsmall landholdings in the rural areas. Land disputes and land grabbing by powerful elites often with small \\ncompensation are frequent events in Bangladesh. Land speculation is similarly rampant, esp ecially in urban \\nareas. Inequitable access to land often through subsidized land distribution by Rajuk (the Dhaka \\nDevelopment Agency) to the rich elites and also through illegal land grabbing of public land in collusion \\nwith corrupt public officials have t ended to create huge inequality in wealth and income. Proper land \\nmanagement can be very helpful to correct this source of inequality. The 8FYP will strengthen the land \\nadministration regime and related land market through a range of institutional, regulat ory, and fiscal policy \\nreforms. These reforms include computerization of land records; simplification of land transactions and \\nland registration. The market price of land/real estate should be the basis of determining registration fees \\nand property taxes. This will increase revenues of the government substantially. Such reforms will also \\nprotect the poor farmers from the clutches of the predatory land grabbers. A proper capital gain tax on land \\ntransactions will be another important way to reduce windfall c apital gains; it will also help to stabilize land \\nprices by discouraging land speculation and provide important revenue earnings to the government for \\nspending on social services.  \\nb. Redistributive Fiscal Policies  \\nResearch from Bangladesh shows that a combin ation of better tax compliance with greater focus on \\npersonal income taxation and redistribution of these resources through public expenditures targeted to the \\npoor can improve income distribution. Results of simulations are illustrated in Box 4.2.  \\n   111 \\n Box 4 .2: Simulated Impacts on Inequality with Fiscal Transfer in Bangladesh  \\nThe importance of a strong fiscal re -distributive system epitomized by better tax compliance/administration, higher \\ndirect tax revenue, and cash transfers on improving equity is shown w ith an illustration from Bangladesh. The gain in \\ninequality (measured by Gini coefficient) via better compliance of personal income tax system and subsequent transfer \\nof additional revenue through better compliance to bottom 50 percent of the population is  presented below. The \\nsimulation outcomes are derived from a micro -simulation model based on the latest household income and expenditure \\nsurvey (HIES 2016) linked to the macro projections of the Bangladesh perspective plan (2021 to 2041). Three \\nsimulations  are carried out. (i) Base (poor compliance) simulation suggests high growth rates of 8 to 9 percent with poor \\nfiscal distribution (as observed currently) may likely to have negligible effects on Gini. (ii) Base high compliance of the \\npersonal income tax ( all eligible taxpayers are paying according to their marginal rates) may significantly improve the \\ninequality situation in Bangladesh. (iii) Reduction in Gini is dramatic when the revenue gains through better tax \\ncompliance are effectively transferred to t he bottom 50 percent of the population.  \\nPanel A: Impacts on Gini  Panel B: Percentage point reduction in Gini  \\n(over base)  \\n \\nSource: Khondker et al (2020)   \\n \\n \\nThe introduction of a redistributive fiscal policy is a core fiscal policy reform in the PP204 1. The 8FYP \\nwill initiate the first phase implementation of this fiscal policy. The combination of taxes and social \\nspending that will be introduced to implement a redistributive fiscal policy is illustrated in Table 4.9.  \\n  0.47\\n0.47\\n0.46\\n0.46\\n0.46\\n0.470.46\\n0.45\\n0.43\\n0.43\\n0.35\\n0.230.44\\n0.42\\n0.38\\n0.36\\n0.27\\n0.11\\n0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.50\\nFY16 FY20 FY25 FY30 FY35 FY40Gini (0 -1)\\nBase (poor tax compliance)\\nBase (high tax compliance)\\nTransfers to bottom 50%\\n-0.01\\n-0.02\\n-0.03\\n-0.04\\n-0.11\\n-0.24-0.04\\n-0.04\\n-0.08\\n-0.10\\n-0.20\\n-0.35\\n-0.40-0.35-0.30-0.25-0.20-0.15-0.10-0.050.00FY16 FY20 FY25 FY30 FY35 FY40Percentage points\\nBase (high tax compliance) 112 \\n Table 4.9: 8FYP Fiscal Reforms for Lowering Income Inequality (% of GDP)  \\nReform measures  FY2019 \\n(base year)  5-year \\nIncrease  FY2025  \\nIncrease spending on education  2.0 1.0 3.0 \\nIncrease spending on health  0.7 1.3 2.0 \\nIncrease spending on social protection (excluding civil service pensio n) 1.2 0.8 2.0 \\nIncrease spending on rural infrastructure & water  1.9 1.1 3.0 \\nTotal increase in social spending   4.2  \\nFinanced by: Cutback on subsidies & SOE transfers  1.4      (-1.0)    0.4 \\n   : increase in income tax  2.6 1.9 4.5 \\n   : increase in valu e added tax  3.3 1.6 4.9 \\n   : increase in local government revenues  0.2 0.5 0.7 \\nTotal financing   5.0  \\nSource: Eighth Plan Strategy  \\nThe first and topmost policy priority is to raise the share of public spending on education and health to at \\nleast 3 and 2 percent of GDP respectively. This will also require major improvements in the delivery of \\npublic education and health services through education policies, governance, and institutional reforms.  \\nSecond, another area where public spending has to increase con cerns rural infrastructure --rural roads, rural \\nelectricity, irrigation, and flood control. Government spending in this area has helped increase farm \\nproductivity and food production. The near food self -sufficiency of Bangladesh despite rapid population \\ngrowth is a testimony to the success of this policy. Yet, much of the labour force remains engaged in low \\nproductivity and low earnings agriculture.  There is a further need to diversify agriculture into higher value -\\nadded activities and to help transfer surp lus labour from agriculture to non -farm activities in rural and urban \\nareas.  This transformation will support both growth and income distribution by helping increase average \\nlabour productivity in the economy.  Furthermore, the implementation of the water  investments in BDP2100 \\nwill greatly benefit farm productivity and reduce the loss of rural livelihoods and property from flooding \\nand riverbank erosion.  Additional spending of 1 percent of GDP on rural infrastructure will be helpful and \\nprovided for in t he ADP of the 8FYP (chapter 5).   \\nThe availability of rural credit is another important determinant of this transformation. The micro -credit \\nrevolution has helped the poor to build up assets and also protect their consumption, thereby contributing \\nto lower  poverty. Nevertheless, the scaling up of formal credit to the rural economy remains a challenge. \\nThe 8FYP will take steps to improve this.  \\nA third area where public spending has to grow concerns about social protection. Presently the government \\nspends 1.2  % of GDP on social protection excluding civil service pensions. The 8FYP projects this to grow \\nto 2.0 percent of GDP over the next 5 years.   \\nHigher public spending on education, health, rural infrastructure and social protection by an estimated \\nadditiona l 4.2 percent of GDP is a seemingly tall order in the present environment of public resource \\nconstraint. A closer look will suggest that a strategy to mobilize this additional funding is certainly within \\nthe reach of public policy and is incorporated in th e 8FYP fiscal policy discussed in greater detail in chapter 5.   113 \\n In the first place, the government spends some 3.4 percent of GDP on subsidies and transfers, of which 1.4 \\npercent of GDP is on subsidies and transfers to power and other SOEs including public banks.  A core fiscal \\nreform of the 8FYP is to convert the SOEs including the power sector and public banks to profit -making \\nenterprises. These subsidies will, therefore, be drastically reduced and re -channelled to priority social \\nspending as noted above.  \\nSecondly, a major reason for the resource constraint is low tax collection, especially from personal income \\ntaxes. The effective income tax rate at present is about only 4 percent, which is very low.  Increasing the \\neffective income tax rate to even 10 pe rcent in the next 3 -5 years to the top 10 percentile who own 35 \\npercent of the national income will yield 3.5 percent of GDP instead of 1.4 percent of GDP now.  This will \\nrequire the closing of loopholes that let capital gains escape the tax net, treating all sources of personal \\nincome equally for taxation purpose, and improving tax administration and compliance. So, along with \\ncorporate income taxation, the total tax on income and profit is projected to grow from 2.6% in FY2019 to \\n4.5% by FY2025.  The mode rnization of VAT and improving its productivity can yield an additional 1.8% \\nof GDP.  Moreover, the introduction of a modern property tax and assigning this to the local governments \\ncan be a substantial boost for their fiscal autonomy while providing fisca l resources.   \\nThis combination of expenditure reallocation (1% of GDP) and additional tax effort focused on personal \\nincome, VAT and local government revenues (4.0% of GDP) can finance the additional 4% of GDP \\nrequired to fund critical social programmes, while also leaving a surplus of 1% of GDP for additional \\ninvestment in infrastructure.  This fiscal policy package can be a powerful instrument for improving income \\ndistribution as the incidence of this tax and expenditure package is likely to be highly pr ogressive. In \\naddition to a more effective fiscal policy, the government can also help improve income distribution through \\nbetter governance.  \\n  114 \\n    115 \\n CHAPTER 5 \\nPUBLIC INVESTMENT PROGRAMME AND ITS FINANCING  \\n5.1 OVERVIEW  \\nHistorically, the private sector has led the way in driving GDP growth through private investment (Figure \\n5.1). Public investment has made a strong recovery since FY2011. Yet, the role of private investment will \\ncontinue to dominate. Accordingly, the indicative Financing Plan for the 8FYP is estimate d on the \\nassumption that the private sector would continue to play this dominant role. Nevertheless, the realization \\nof the 8FYP objectives would require a good balance and complementarity between private and public \\ninvestment efforts. Thus, while, acceler ated private sector investment -both domestic and foreign -will be \\nthe key to the success of the Plan, the government’s role will be to create the investment -friendly \\nenvironment, restore and strengthen human health and welfare in the post COVID -19 world, an d ease \\ninfrastructure constraints. As in the past and consistent with the social objectives of the 8FYP, the public \\nsector will continue to play the crucial role of making the growth more inclusive through fiscal and other \\ninterventions by making the tax s ystem more equitable and undertaking expenditure programmes aimed at \\nstrengthening social protection by improving quality of living for the underprivileged segments of the \\nsociety. The Government has initiated the implementation of a Joint Programme called  Integrated National \\nFinancing Framework for Accelerating Achievement of SDGs in Bangladesh.  This will support the \\ngovernment to put in place an integrated financing framework to mobilise required resources more \\neffectively from public and private sources for attaining SDGs by 2030. The programme will facilitate \\nrevisiting the existing Development Finance Assessment (DFA) and SDG Financing Strategy to make them \\nmore focused on the priorities arising from Bangladesh’s LDC graduation and the COVID -19 pandemic  \\nrecovery.  \\nFigure 5.1: Investment Trends (% of GDP)  \\n \\nSource: BBS and Ministry of Finance  05101520253035\\n1972-73\\n1973-74\\n1974-75\\n1975-76\\n1976-77\\n1977-78\\n1978-79\\n1979-80\\n1980-81\\n1981-82\\n1982-83\\n1983-84\\n1984-85\\n1985-86\\n1986-87\\n1987-88\\n1988-89\\n1989-90\\n1990-91\\n1991-92\\n1992-93\\n1993-94\\n1994-95\\n1995-96\\n1996-97\\n1997-98\\n1998-99\\n1999-00\\n2000-01\\n2001-02\\n2002-03\\n2003-04\\n2004-05\\n2005-06\\n2006-07\\n2007-08\\n2008-09\\n2009-10\\n2010-11\\n2011-12\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16\\n2016-17\\n2017-18\\n2018-19Investment Rates (% of GDP) Private investment rate Public investment rate 116 \\n The main focus of annual development expenditure will be to sharply improve health infrastructure, re -\\nbuild the social protection system, infrastructure constraints and strengthen water management. Topmost \\npriority will be given to rebuild the healthcare system through increased budgetary allocations, sharply \\nstronger management of the public healthcare system and partnership with private healthcare. Budgetary \\nallocat ions to the education sector will be increased to create better human capital through universal general \\neducation, skill development programmes, and training and greater access to ICT solutions. Implementation \\nof the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS ) will be fast -tracked to provide comprehensive social \\nprotection to all poor and vulnerable citizens based on a modern Life Cycle based approach. In the area of \\ninfrastructure, in addition to completing the ongoing transformational infrastructure projects , major \\ninitiatives will be taken to broaden and accelerate the implementation of other major highways and bridges, \\npower sector projects, and providing access to serviced land to foreign and domestic investors in the context \\nof the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) initiative. Finally, strong efforts will be made to implement the first \\nphase of the BDP 2100.  \\nTaking these considerations into account, Annual Budgets will be formulated in a manner consistent with \\nthe realization of the Eighth Plan objectives. Ann ual Budget and ADP will be synchronized to use them as \\ntools for achieving the objectives of the 8FYP. Financing of this National Plan will require increased private \\nand public sector savings, rapid income growth for the private sector and increased revenu e mobilization \\nthrough reform and modernization of tax policy and tax administration. Prudent spending of public sector \\nresources for better public service delivery and incentive, subsidy and transfer programmes, and improved \\nefficiency of public sector en terprises will be important for public sector resource efficiency and \\nproductivity .  \\n5.2 OVERALL RESOURCE ENVELOPE FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMME  \\n5.2.1  Total investment and Financing  \\nTotal investment under the Plan will amount to Tk.63.6 trillion in constant FY 2021 prices (the first year of \\nthe Plan). As in the past, domestic resources in the form of national savings will continue to play a dominant \\nrole in the financing of the Eighth Plan (94.9%).  Foreign savings will provide the remaining 5.1% of the \\nfinancing requirements for the 8FYP. This is a modest recourse to foreign resources consistent with the \\ngovernment strategy to minimize external borrowing. This cautious external borrowing strategy has been a \\ncore positive aspect of the Bangladesh macroeconomic mana gement that has contributed substantially to \\nmaintain the stability of the external account.  \\nTable 5.1: Financing of Eighth Five Year Plan Investment (FY 2021 prices)  \\nItem: BDT in Billions  Total  Share (%)  \\nTotal Investment  63574  100.0  \\n--Public  16058  25.3 \\n--Private  47516  74.7 \\nFinanced By:    \\nDomestic Resources  60358  94.9 \\nExternal Resources  3216  5.1 \\nSource: GED Projections   117 \\n 5.2.2  Private Investment and Financing  \\nThe investment role of the private sector will be enhanced under the 8FYP based on an expandin g role of \\nFDI, with private investment accounting for 75% of the total investment.  As underscored in Chapter 3 on \\nMedium Term Macroeconomic Framework, increasing the inflow of FDI in Bangladesh to 3% of GDP \\nfrom current levels of about 1% would be critica l for achieving the investment target under the 8FYP.  Thus, \\nthe share of FDI in private investment Bangladesh and some limited external borrowing in foreign currency \\nby the private sector, will increase markedly to 7%, compared with 3% in the 7FYP. This i s a major strategic \\nshift in the 8FYP that will play a key role in boosting private investments and exports, and thereby offset \\nthe lack lustre performance of private investment during the 7FYP. The rapid growth in FDI will also play \\na major role in upgrad ing technology and strengthening knowledge transfer and skill development.  \\n5.2.3  Public Sector Investment and Financing  \\nThe Annual Development Programme (ADP) constituting much of the public sector investment in \\nBangladesh has increased by 2 percentage poi nts in relation to GDP to 6% during FY15 -FY19. The increase \\nin ADP reversed the declining trend observed in the past decade and is attributable to government’s efforts \\nto reduce the wide infrastructure gap in Bangladesh through accelerated ADP implementati on. This increase \\nin ADP spending happened despite slower than expected progress in implementing some major public \\nsector and PPP -based projects during the Seventh Plan.  \\nThe Eighth Plan will build on the gains made so far with a view to allocating Tk.16.1  trillion in constant \\nFY21 prices of public investment, accounting for 25.3% of total investment in the economy. Of the total \\npublic sector investment, Tk. 12.8 trillion will be funded by domestic resources (80%), comprising of public \\nsavings (36%) and dom estic bank and non -bank borrowings (44%) External financing, primarily in the \\nform of concessional loans from official multilateral and bilateral sources will continue to supplement the \\npublic sector development spending, contributing on a net basis to 20%  of the public investment financing. \\nAccess to international capital market to finance large infrastructure projects by issuing sovereign bonds \\nmay also be considered as a source of external financing for domestic public investment. As noted, the \\npublic se ctor investment financing plan based on the projected fiscal deficit is fully consistent with debt \\nsustainability.  Resort to bank borrowings for financing the fiscal deficits is also built in the monetary \\nprojections of the 8FYP contained in Chapter 3, an d therefore are fully consistent with inflation targets and \\ntargets for credit allocation to the private sector.  \\n5.3 FISCAL POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR THE EIGHTH PLAN  \\nThe fiscal policy framework for the 8FYP is summarized in Table 5.2. This is basically drawn from the \\nfiscal policy framework of PP2041 but adjusted to reflect the impact of COVID -19.  The three main \\nhighlights of the 8FYP fiscal framework are: First, that a concerted fiscal policy reform effort will be \\nundertaken to arrest the downward trend of revenu e and allow for a substantial expansion in the tax to GDP \\nratio. Second, the higher revenue mobilization will provide a basis for restoring the public expenditure \\nprogramme to address the key development priorities of the 8FYP. And third, there will be an initial surge \\nin fiscal deficit away from the medium -to-long term target of 5% of GDP level owing to COVID -19, but \\nthis will be overcome swiftly and restored to the 5% of GDP level based on tax revenue mobilization and \\ncontinued commitment to prudent fisca l policy management.   118 \\n Table 5.2: 8FYP Fiscal Framework (Percent of GDP)  \\nFiscal Year  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25   \\nActual  Projections  \\nFiscal Indicators:  (As % of GDP)  \\nRevenue and Grants  9.97 9.48 10.26  11.16  12.05  12.90  14.10  \\nTotal Revenue  9.90 9.40 10.18  11.10  12.00  12.86  14.06  \\n   Tax Revenue  8.89 7.89 9.02 9.80 10.60  11.26  12.26  \\n      NBR Tax Revenue  8.60 7.68 8.55 9.40 10.10  10.66  11.56  \\n      Non-NBR Tax Revenue  0.29 0.21 0.47 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 \\n   Non-Tax Revenue  1.02 1.51 1.16 1.30 1.40 1.60 1.80 \\nGrants  0.07 0.07 0.08 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.04  \\n(As % of GDP)  \\nTotal Expenditure  15.41  14.86  17.06  16.91  17.57  17.90  19.10  \\nNon-Development Expenditure including net \\nlending  9.47 9.11 11.13  10.90  11.08  11.25  12.07  \\n       Non-Development Expenditure  9.37 8.99 10.99  10.75  10.93  11.10  11.92  \\n                 Revenue Expenditure  8.57 8.33 9.86 9.93 10.11  10.26  11.08  \\n                 Capital Expenditure  0.80 0.66 1.13 0.82 0.83 0.84 0.85 \\n       Net Lending  0.10 0.13 0.13 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 \\n   Developm ent Expenditure  5.94 5.75 5.93 6.02 6.49 6.66 7.03 \\n      ADP Expenditure  5.79 5.52 5.70 5.89 6.36 6.53 6.90 \\n      Non-ADP Development Spending  0.15 0.23 0.23 0.13 0.13 0.13 0.13 \\nOverall Balance (excl. grants)  -5.51 -5.46 -6.88 -5.81 -5.57 -5.04 -5.04 \\nOverall Balance (Incl. grants)  -5.44 -5.39 -6.80 -5.75 -5.52 -5.00 -5.00 \\nPrimary Balance  -3.50 -3.33 -4.78 -3.65 -3.36 -2.77 -2.76  \\n(As % of GDP)  \\nFinancing  5.44 5.39 6.80 5.75 5.52 5.00 5.00 \\n    External (Net) [including market borrowing]  1.23 1.88 2.40 2.42 2.44 2.46 2.48 \\n         Loans  1.76 2.30 2.8 2.35 2.33 2.32 2.30 \\n        Amortization  -0.53 -0.39 -0.40 -0.39 -0.41 -0.45 -0.45 \\n    Domestic  4.21 3.50 4.40 3.33 3.08 2.54 2.52 \\n        Bank (CrPbs: Money)  1.20 3.32 3.30 1.94 1.19 0.65 0.63 \\n        Non-Bank  3.01 0.18 1.10 1.39 1.89 1.89 1.89 \\nMemorandum Item:         \\nNominal GDP, In Billion, Taka  25425  27964  31565  35661  40363  45776  51956  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh, and GED Projection  \\n5.3.1  The Need for Higher Public Spending  \\nBanglades h traditionally has a small public administration and overall public spending is modest for a \\ncountry the size of Bangladesh with immense development needs.

Yet revenue shortages and implementation constraints have limited \\nthe ability to spend adequate resources in human development and social protection (Table 5.3). The \\nonslaught of COVID -19 has exposed the huge social vulnerabilities and the need for scaling up spending \\non human development, especially healthcare and social protection. With the present low level of resource \\nmobilization and the need for maintaining fiscal pr udence, the only way for increasing spending on core \\ndevelopment priorities is to increase revenue mobilization.   \\n   119 \\n Table 5.3: Public Spending Priorities (% of GDP)  \\nExpenditure Item  FY10  FY15  FY19  FY25  \\nTotal spending  13.9 13.5 15.4 19.1 \\nNon-development spending  10.3 9.1 9.5 12.1 \\nDevelopment Spending  3.6 4.0 6.0 7.0 \\nEducation  1.6 1.7 2.0 3.0 \\nHealth  0.6 0.6 0.7 2.0 \\nSocial Protection (w/o civil service pension)  1.4 1.4 1.2 2.0 \\nPower, Energy and Transport  1.5 1.8 2.4 2.0 \\nAgriculture and Rural infrastru cture  0.6 0.8 0.9 1.0 \\nIntegrated Water Resource Management  0.5 0.7 1.0 2.0 \\nSource Ministry of Finance and GED Projections  \\nThe fiscal framework for the 8FYP projects to increase tax to GDP ratio to grow from 8.9% of GDP in \\nFY19 to 12.3 in FY25.  Some incr ease in non -tax revenue is also projected that grows total revenues as a \\npercentage of GDP from 9.9% in FY19 to 14.1% in FY25. This 4.2 percentage points increase in total \\nrevenues as a share of GDP is critical to build up public spending to a minimal leve l that is necessary to \\nachieve the 8FYP growth and poverty objectives while addressing the human health challenges posed by \\nCOVID -19.   \\nThe spending response to COVID -19 requires some important shifts in public spending priorities in 8FYP. \\nThese are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Rebui lding the healthcare system:  The most important task is to overhaul and build up the healthcare \\nsystem of Bangladesh. Accordingly, public spending on healthcare will sharply increase from 0.7% of \\nGDP in FY19 to 2.0% of GDP by FY25.  \\n\\uf0b7 Social protection:  Spending on social protection also needs to go up to provide income support to the \\nlarge number of near -poor who tripped over to the poverty group owing to income loses from COVID -\\n19. More generally, social protection will move to the NSSS recommended Life Cy cle risk mitigation \\napproach along with progress towards employment -based social insurance and Universal Health Care. \\nSpending on social protection excluding civil service pension, which are not targeted to the poor and \\nvulnerable, will grow from 1.2% of G DP in FY19 to 2.0% of GDP by FY25.   \\n\\uf0b7 Risk Mitigation:  For increasing penetr ation of insurance in our economy, insurance sector is planning \\nto diversify insurance products both in life and non -life sub-sectors like Bhaban Bima, Bangabandhu \\nSchool Bima, Insurance for all Passengers, Neuro -developmental Insurance, Agriculture Enter prise \\nInsurance etc. These Insurance products will be distributed by diversified distribution channels such as \\nBanc assurance, Corporate Agents, Brokers etc.    \\n\\uf0b7 Education and training:  Human capital buildup will require strengthening of education and traini ng \\nprogrammes  along with the spread of ICT education.  Therefore, spending on education will grow from \\n2.0% of GDP in FY19 to 3.0% by FY25.   \\n\\uf0b7 Power, energy and transport:  The emphasis on infrastructure will remain. The top priority will be to \\ncomplete all ongoing transformational project. Other power, energy and transport projects needed to \\nsupport growth acceleration will be pursued.  However, a strategic shift in financing will happen with \\na stronger reliance on PPP -type financing. Accordingly, ADP alloca tions in power, energy and \\ninfrastructure sector will decline marginally as a share of GDP to 2% but allocations will still grow \\nhealthily in real terms. Importantly, an additional 1 -1.5% of GDP infrastructure financing will be \\nmobilized through PPP fundin g. So, combining ADP and PPP spending, the public investment share of \\ninfrastructure will also grow significantly as a share of GDP.   120 \\n \\uf0b7 Agriculture and rural infrastructure:  The priority to agriculture and rural infrastructure will be \\npreserved and strengthen ed with a further increase to 1% of GDP by FY25.  \\n\\uf0b7 BDP2100 implementation:  A major priority of 8FYP is to initiate the implementation of the \\nBangladesh Delta Plan (BDP2100). The first phase BDP2100 investment programme during the 8FYP \\ncalls for integrated w ater resource management to improve flood control, lower salinity, reduce water \\nlogging, reduce the incidence of river bank erosion, enhance the availability of fresh water for irrigation, \\nindustrial supply and for human consumption, improve land and fores t management and strengthen the \\neco-system.  The projected allocation for BDP2100 investment program will increase from 1% of GDP \\nin FY19 to 2% of GDP by FY25.  \\n5.4 REVENUE MOBILIZATION UNDER THE 7FYP: LESSONS FOR 8FYP  \\nThe 7FYP set up the target for a strong t ax performance but actual performance was much lower despite \\nhigher average GDP growth in the first 4 years of the 7FYP. The tax to GDP ratio fell further due to COVID -\\n19 impact but on a trend basis the tax performance was already off track in the first 8 months of FY20 \\nbefore COVID -19. The yearly tax targets and actual performance are shown in Table 5.4. The 7FYP sought \\nto increase the tax to GDP ratio from 9.4% in FY15 to 12.3% in FY20 and non -tax revenue to grow from \\n1.2% to 2.0% over the same period. Th is was predicated on the implementation of major tax reforms as \\nwell as reforms of state -owned enterprises and local government entities. In the event, none of the reforms \\nwere implemented and actual revenue performance for both taxes and non -taxes fell mu ch short of target. \\nNon-tax revenues increased marginally 1.5% of GDP, while tax performance actually declined to 7.9% of \\nGDP in FY20  \\nTable 5.4: Revenue - 7FYP Targets and Actual Collection  \\nFiscal year  FY16  FY17  FY18  FY19  FY20  Average \\n(FY16 -20)  (7FYP Targ et, In Billions of Taka)  \\nTotal Revenue  2084  2634  3172  3808  4627  3265  \\n      Tax Revenue  1822  2244  2728  3304  4052  2830  \\n             NBR Tax Revenue  1764  2166  2639  3203  3937  2742  \\n       Non-Tax Revenue  262 390 444 504 575 435  (Actual, In Billions of Tak a) \\nTotal Revenue  1730  2012  2166  2518  2630  2211  \\n      Tax Revenue  1519  1781  1943  2259  2207  1942  \\n             NBR Tax Revenue  1462  1716  1871  2186  2148  1877  \\n       Non-Tax Revenue  211 231 222 259 423 269 \\nIndicators:  (7FYP Target, As % of GDP)  \\nTotal Reve nue 12.1 13.5 14.3 15.1 16.1 14.2 \\n      Tax Revenue  10.6 11.5 12.3 13.1 14.1 12.3 \\n             NBR Tax Revenue  10.3 11.1 11.9 12.7 13.7 11.9 \\n       Non-Tax Revenue  1.5 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.9  (Actual Revenue, As % of GDP)  \\nTotal Revenue  10.0 10.2 9.6 9.9 9.4 9.8 \\n      Tax Revenue  8.8 9.0 8.6 8.9 7.9 8.6 \\n             NBR Tax Revenue  8.4 8.7 8.3 8.6 7.7 8.3 \\n       Non-Tax Revenue  1.2 1.2 1.0 1.0 1.5 1.2 \\nMemo items:        \\nNominal GDP, 7FYP  17176  19517  22177  25223  28739  22566  \\nActual Nominal GDP  17329  19758 22505  25425  27964  22596  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh, and 7FYP Projections   121 \\n The main reason for tax revenue shortfall was the inability to implement major tax reforms envisaged during \\nthe 7FYP. The most important planned tax reform was the im plementation of the VAT Law of 2012. This \\nis a fundamental reform that seeks to modernize the VAT system and enhance tax collection by improving \\nthe productivity of VAT. The reform efforts progressed considerably including improvement in the \\ntechnical capa city of the NBR through technical assistance and adoption of digital technology to facilitate \\nimplementation. But actual implementation of the original VAT Law of 2012 did not happen. Reform of \\nthe income tax law, policies and procedures have also not happ ened. The planned administrative reform of \\nthe NBR articulated in the Tax Modernization Plan of 2011 is yet to be fully implemented.  \\nThe Government recognizes these challenges and aims to speed up tax reforms in the 8FYP. The \\nGovernment gave this signal i n approving the Fiscal Framework of the PP2041 that envisages attaining a \\ntax to GDP ratio of 17% by FY2031 and 22% by FY2041, which are comparable to average tax to GDP \\nratios in upper middle income and high -income countries (Figure 5.2). This will be ach ieved on the basis \\nof an overhaul of tax laws and tax administration focussed specifically on modernizing the system of income \\nand VAT taxes with a view to achieving tax collection and tax structure found in UMIC and HIC. The main \\nfeature of this moderniza tion is the introduction of a universal and progressive system of income taxes that \\nbecomes the primary source of tax collection as found in UMIC and HIC.  \\nFigure 5.2: PP2041 Tax Structure  \\n \\n    Source:   PP2041 Macroeconomic Framework  \\nThe 8FYP fiscal fra mework postulated in Table 5.5 above is based on the Fiscal Framework for PP2041 \\nsummarized in Figure 5.2.

The PP2041 tax system \\nmodernizes this to a tax system that is focused on income as the primary source of tax revenues, relies on \\nself-assessment and on -line filing and tax payments, uses a simplified filing syste m for most taxes except \\nfor complicated cases, and relies on selective and productive audits that are criteria based. There is a \\nseparation of tax policy from tax collection. Tax collection is automated with no interface between tax \\ncollector and tax payer , thereby eliminating the risks of bribery and negotiated tax settlements. This is a \\nvastly different system than presently. So, full implementation will take time. But an important start will \\nbe made in the 8FYP.    \\nThe specific tax reform strategies that  are possible under the 8FYP are summarized in Box 5.1.  It is the \\nfirst step towards implementing the full FY2041 Long -Term Fiscal Policy Framework for the next 20 years \\nto FY2041. The 8FYP is the first medium -term programme for its implementation. In thi s first phase \\nimportant legal and procedural reforms relating to the VAT, income tax and custom duties are introduced.  \\nTrade reforms ae discussed separately in Chapter 2 Part 2, but they have implications for tax revenues. The \\nmain implication is the redu ction in reliance on trade taxes for revenue purposes and instead using trade  123 \\n policy for growth, export promotion and industrialization. The revenue consequences are peripheral and \\nare recouped by income and VAT taxes, as is the case with UMIC and HIC tax structures. The proposed \\ntax reforms in Box 5.1 are extremely important and cannot be delayed further in order to restore tax revenue \\ncollections and support the needs for essential public spending as summarized in Table 5.3.  \\nBox 5.1: NBR Tax Reform Requir ed for Attaining Tax Targets in Eighth Plan  \\n \\nTax Policy Reforms  \\n\\uf0b7 Full adoption and effective implementation of the original VAT and Supplementary Duty Act 2012strating in \\nFY2022  \\n\\uf0b7 Incorporating Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Income Tax, VAT and Custo m Acts  \\n\\uf0b7 A thorough overhaul and simplification of Income Taxes with implementation in FY2023  \\n\\uf0b7 Adoption and implementation of the new Customs Act in FY2022.  \\n\\uf0b7 By end of FY2022, introduce a proper system of property taxes with revenues earmarked for local \\ngovern ments  \\n\\uf0b7 Starting FY2024, separate tax planning from tax collection.  \\n\\uf0b7 Starting FY2024, selection of NBR Chair and the new Chair of the Tax Policy Unit should be done on a \\nprofessional basis with a 5 -year fixed term appointment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide adequate resources and a utonomy to NBR Chair and the Chair of Tax Policy Unit to modernize their \\nrespective offices with modern technology, professional staffing and policy and research capabilities.  \\n \\nTax Administration Reforms: Income Tax  \\n\\uf0b7 Broadening of the taxpayers’ base - This will require monitoring of the ownership of all sizable physical and \\nfinancial assets of taxpayers and determining the income generation out of those assets.   \\n\\uf0b7 Broadening of the tax revenue sources - Traditionally there has been an excess dependency on taxi ng \\nfinancial institutions and a few large non -financial corporations. The tax department should explore other \\nsmaller organizations in the formal sector as well various corporations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Focusing on income from service providers and self -employed (who are dif ficult to tax)  \\n\\uf0b7 Treating all sources of income equally for the tax purpose without discrimination for the households.  \\nThis would imply taxation of capital gains from land, real estate/housing, and stock market. Wealth \\naccumulation in Bangladesh is primarily  happening through accumulation of urban land and real estate, \\nuntaxed/low tax income of the rapidly growing RMG sector, and relatively low tax incidence on income \\nthrough financial instruments. This must change.  \\n\\uf0b7 Automation of TIN registration and linking  TIN with National I.D.  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrated Revenue Management Programme: Business Process an integrated revenue management \\nprogramme seeks to connect the three departments at transactional level by linking the taxpayer identification \\nnumbers i.e. TIN and BIN in th e database. The methodology for setting up such an integrated system is to \\nfirst centralize the database and transaction processing of the three departments at one location and then to \\nbuild an information system that can mine data in the three databases a nd thereafter process the same for \\nexception reports. The integrated revenue management programme will enable the desired flow of information \\nand consequent synergy among the three tax wings of the NBR.  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrated Revenue Management Programme: Digitalizati on Programme This programme will seek to \\nset up a country -wide integrated ICT platform to capture all tax payment information from tax returns, banks, \\nTDS detectors, third party collection agencies etc.  The integrated revenue management system will also \\nreceive third party returns i.e. TDS returns, Annual Information Returns (AIR) etc. and generate MIS reports, \\nexception reports etc. Under this programme, a Central Processing Centre is to be set up for processing all \\nIncome -tax and VAT returns, whether e -filed or paper filed at one integrated processing centre.   124 \\n \\uf0b7 E-Filing of income tax returns and online payments.  To enable this, the tax form will be simplified and \\nthe wealth statement requirement will be deleted for certain income threshold. NBR tax accoun t will be opened \\nup with selected banks to send online payments.  \\n\\uf0b7 Aggressive imposition and expansion of withholding taxes , particularly on individual taxes which could \\npotentially improve tax compliance, expand the income tax base and address administrativ e issues pertaining \\nto tax collection efforts through increased transparency and efficiency.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strategic Communication and Taxpayer Outreach, Education and Assistance  Bangladesh has a very \\nnarrow tax base and a very small percentage of the population bears t he burden of taxation. Most of the direct \\ntax revenues come from tax deduction at source (TDS) whereas a large percentage should be coming from \\ncorporate tax as well as from businesses and professions through advance tax (PAYE). The logical inference \\nis gross under reporting or non -reporting from various eligible categories. The taxpayer education programme \\nwill make available a menu of offerings through remote outlets like websites, internet etc. as well as through \\ncustomers facing one to one or group inte rface with the NBR Customer Service Wing.  \\n\\uf0b7 Selective and productive audits: Institute an audit system where only a limited number of tax cases will be \\naudited based on computer - based criteria.  The system will be designed to be highly productive in terms o f \\nrevenue collection and low -cost of collection in terms of staff time.  \\n \\nTax Administration Reforms: VAT and Custom  \\n\\uf0b7 Implementation of the new VAT Act.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding VAT base especially on businesses and organization.  \\n\\uf0b7 Incentivizing VAT payment with benefits fo r small businesses to bring them into the VAT coverage as well \\nas promoting increased formalization of businesses currently operating in the informal sector.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reform of the VAT administration along functional lines  \\n\\uf0b7 Automation of the whole tax administration  through Central Data base including Central VAT Registration; \\nelectronic submission and return processing  \\n\\uf0b7 Comprehensive taxpayers’ education and information campaign about the new VAT law and Rules.  \\n\\uf0b7 Selective and productive audits as in the case of income  taxes.  \\n \\nBox 5.1 also discusses immediate institutional reforms, some of which have been left hanging since the \\n6FYP as articulated in the Tax Modernization Plan of 2011. The need for strengthening of the tax \\nadministration, its computerization and improv ement in efficiency is integral to achieving 8FYP tax targets. \\nThis is mainly because the crux of the tax growth would be derived from domestic sources, mainly income \\ntax and VAT. Expansion of the income tax base and bringing more individuals and companies  under the \\ntax net and under the withholding mechanism would be necessary to drive the revenue growth and to \\nachieve levels enjoyed by our neighbouring countries. Since a major section of the Bangladesh economy \\nstill falls under the informal sector it is o ne of the main reasons behind the slow increase in the number of \\nincome taxpayers as well as limiting the potential VAT collection. Initiatives and incentives by the \\ngovernment to formalize these activities would greatly enhance the tax potential on the do mestic side while \\nmaking it possible to achieve the targets set under the 8FYP.  \\nThere is also rampant tax evasion which is manifested through the very low number of registered direct tax \\npayers, transfer pricing and money laundering. This needs to be addre ssed by strengthening tax evasion \\ndetecting unit like the Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) and other intelligence units of the NBR. The NBR \\nshould work together with the Bangladesh Bank and the Anti -Corruption Commission for combating tax \\nevasion. There is also a huge backlog of revenue cases pending with courts. More than 20,000 cases are \\nlying with different courts involving about 20 billion Taka. Following the South African model, the NBR  125 \\n has introduced the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism t o settle disputes out of the court \\nsystem. The ADR mechanism will be further popularized and strengthened to collect arrear revenue.  \\nWith more manufacturing facilities in EPZs and particularly with growing number of SEZs coming into \\noperation, Bond Adminis tration under the NBR will need to be refocused keeping in mind the different \\ngoals behavioural orientations of Tax Officials and Bond Administration. In this regard the government \\nwill consider bond administration can be separated from full customs admini stration and also lined its \\nperformance with investment, industrialization and trade.  \\nIn order to increase revenue collection, efforts will be made to strengthen the link between better statistical \\nand research analysis and policy formulation and tax admi nistration. NBR has already completed the \\ndiagnostics for strengthening the Statistics and Research Department and efforts will be made to implement \\nthe recommendations of the diagnostic report. Efforts will also be made to enhance tax compliance through \\nsocial recognition programme. Researchers suggest that exposing information about all firms’ tax payment \\nbehaviour to their peers can increase tax compliance and payment. It may also induce additional incentives \\nfor firms to become tax compliant since publi cly available information about tax compliance may affect \\nconsumer behaviour, perhaps steering customers towards tax compliant businesses.  \\n5.4.1  Fiscal Deficit and Financing  \\nThe government’s fiscal deficit level would initially increase owing to the advers e effects of COVID -19 on \\ntax revenues but would stabilize at around the long -term fiscal deficit target of 5% of GDP as envisaged in \\nPP2041 Fiscal Framework. With the projected GDP growth rate of 8% plus and the initial low Debt to GDP \\nratios, there would be no question about debt sustainability. However, the government would need to \\ndiversify its sources of financing with proper mix of domestic and external financing, and on both fronts \\nidentify market based additional sources of financing. On the domestic  borrowing front, dependence on \\nNational Savings Schemes and short -term treasury bills should give way to long -term treasury bills and \\nbonds, infrastructure bonds, etc. with proper secondary market and a well -developed yield curve.  \\n \\nOn the external front,  the access to traditional concessional borrowing from official bilateral and \\nmultilateral sources should be increased and at the same time complemented with additional borrowings in \\nthe form of sovereign bonds of various maturities and other sources of fi nancing. Even with increased \\naccess to concessional finance, its relative importance will decline over time as Bangladesh becomes a \\nUMIC. In addition to the traditional access to multilateral institutions like the World Bank and ADB, the \\nnew Asian Infrastr ucture Bank is also expected to help mobilize concessional external financing for \\ninfrastructure investment in Bangladesh. The government should try to establish its relations with the \\ninternational capital market by launching its first sovereign bond soon  because external and domestic \\nconditions are favourable for such a launch. These strategic transformations should be done on the basis of \\na comprehensive Government Financing and Debt Management Strategy to be prepared by the Debt \\nManagement Wing of the M inistry of Finance. This budget financing scenario for the 8FYP is shown in \\nTable 5.7.  \\n \\n  126 \\n Table 5.7: 8FYP Budget Deficit and Its Financing  \\nFiscal Year  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25   \\nActual  Projections  \\nComponents:  (As % of GDP)  \\nFiscal Deficit (Including Grant)  5.39 6.80 5.75 5.52 5.00 5.00 \\nDeficit Financing  5.39 6.80 5.75 5.52 5.00 5.00 \\n      of Which:        \\n      Net External Financing  1.88 2.40 2.42 2.44 2.46 2.48 \\n      Net Domestic Financing  3.50 4.40 3.33 3.08 2.54 2.52 \\n      of Which:        \\n           Bank Borrowing  3.32 3.30 1.94 1.19 0.65 0.63 \\n           Non-Bank Borrowing  0.18 1.10 1.39 1.89 1.89 1.89 \\nSource: Ministry of Finance and the GED Projections  \\n5.5 DEBT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY UNDER T  HE EIGHTH PLAN  \\n5.5.1  Overall Debt management  \\nBangladesh has the solid track record of managing prudently its public debt and debt service payments. At \\nabout 36% of GDP, the level of government debt is not high by any international standards. During Seventh \\nPlan period the debt/GDP ratio has basically remained s table but its composition changed with external \\ndebt to GDP ratio falling and domestic debt to GDP ratio rising. For the 8FYP, the debt strategy consists of \\nmaintaining fiscal prudence, with fiscal deficit stabilizing at around 5% of GDP after the initial rise to \\nfinance COVID -19 related expenses in the face of falling tax revenues.  Public borrowing will actively \\npursue reliance on low -cost options, use borrowed resources wisely on high -priority investments. At the \\nsame time, efforts will be made to streng then debt servicing capacity by expanding tax revenue and exports, \\nand focus on accelerating GDP growth. So, the debt strategy involving a combination of keeping real \\ninterest rates of public debt very low, achieving high GDP growth rate, and expansion of tax revenues and \\nexports all interact to ensure that the overall debt situation is highly comfortable with no sustainability \\nconcerns.  \\nUnder the fiscal framework of Table 5.3, the total debt to GDP ratio rises by about 4 percentage points from \\nits level in  FY20 to 40% of GDP by FY25. Much of the increase is in external debt ratio as the financing \\nof the budget deficit moves away from high -cost domestic saving certificates and bank borrowing towards \\nlower -cost MLT borrowings.  Some of the increase is to enab le external financing of essential COVID -19 \\nrelated expenditures in health and social protection in FY21 and FY22, followed by MLT financing of key \\ninfrastructure in transport, energy and power and BDP2100 investments. These are all high -productivity \\ninves tments and support growth and human development. Domestic Debt/GDP ratio also rises slightly. But \\nthe overall increase is manageable and fully consistent with debt sustainability.  \\n   127 \\n Figure 5.3: Total Debt and Its Components as % of GDP  \\n \\nSource: Ministry o f Finance and GED Projections  \\nFigure 5.4: Indicators of Debt Service Payments, FY2018 -FY2025  \\n  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance and GED Projections  \\nThe projected increase in external and domestic debt is small and the associated debt servicing is very \\nmanageab le, pointing to Bangladesh’s strengthened capacity to service its debt service obligations (Figure \\n5.4). Total debt service as percent of GDP increases slightly but stabilizes at around at around 2.7% of \\nGDP. The most important result is the rapid decline in debt service payments as a share total government \\nrevenue from a high of 26% in FY20 to 19% in FY25.  This dramatic improvement emerges from the \\nimplementation of the 8FYP fiscal framework that calls for a 3.4 percentage points increase in the tax to \\nGDP ratio over the tax rate in FY2019 and a substitution of high cost domestic borrowing from national \\nsaving certificate lower -cost domestic borrowings and greater reliance on low -cost foreign MLT loans  \\nExternal debt service as percent of exports and remit tances remained increases owing to COVID -19 related \\nloses in export earnings and slowdown of remittance growth as well as an increase in foreign MLT loans.  \\nHowever, the increase is fairly modest, from 3.5% in FY20 to 4.25% in FY25.   Overall, all debt ind icators \\nare comfortable and fully consistent with debt sustainability considerations.  0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25Total Debt/GDP(%) Domestic Debt/GDP(%) External Debt/Export & Remittance(%)\\n0.01.02.03.04.05.0\\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25Public Debt Service/GDP(%) Domestic Debt Service/GDP(%)\\nTotal Debt services/Export & Remittance(%) 128 \\n External Debt Management  \\nThe external financing strategy under the Plan will essentially maintain the current strategy of prudent \\nexternal borrowing on best possible term s with maximum utilization of concessional official bilateral and \\nmultilateral borrowing. Many of the infrastructure projects in the transport and energy sector (like Matarbari \\nPower Hub; Dhaka Metro Rail; Karnaphuli River Tunnel etc.) can be financed from  concessional \\nborrowing. There is also scope for accelerating the pace of donor funded project implementation and reduce \\nthe large aid pipeline which currently stands at more than $29 billion (about 6 years of aid utilization).  \\nThe external financing strat egy under the Plan would also entail broadening of the sources of external \\nfinancing, creating greater scope for private investors to secure external financing on better terms through \\nreduced country/sovereign risk, and continued reliance on official bilat eral and multilateral sources for \\nfinancing large public sector projects or achieving social sector objectives under the Plan. As shown in \\nFigures 5.3 and 5.4 above, continued reliance on this strategy would keep external debt and debt service \\nburden at hi ghly manageable levels throughout the Plan period. Sustaining this strategy will also help \\nreduce Bangladesh’s vulnerability to external shocks and help broaden access to international capital market \\nby domestic borrowers and also reduce financing cost for  domestic borrowers.  \\nDomestic Debt Management  \\nAs in the past, along with fiscal discipline and tax revenue mobilization, the domestic debt strategy for the \\n8FYP will continue to ensure that the government’s borrowing requirements are consistent with inflat ion \\ntargets and allocation of credit to private sector.  There is an initial bank borrowing hump for the budget in \\nFY20 and FY21, partly COVID -19 related, but this is corrected through the tax reform process in FY22 \\nonwards. Efforts will also be made to re duce the high cost of domestic public borrowing in Bangladesh. The \\nexcessive dependence on non -bank borrowing in the form of issuing non -tradable old -fashioned national \\nSavings Certificates at very high cost would give way to market -based instruments and i nterest rate savings. \\nInterest payments on domestic debt is already the largest single budgetary expenditure item and it is also the \\nfastest growing budgetary component. While domestic debt was at 62% of total public debt in FY20, the \\ninterest payments on domestic debt accounted for more than 92% of the estimated total interest payments in \\nFY20. This trend is not healthy and would be reversed.  Efforts will be made under the Eighth Plan to slow \\ndown the growth of domestic interest payments by reducing depen dence on high cost borrowing.  \\nAlthough the high cost of domestic debt servicing does not pose any major debt sustainability issue over \\nthe medium term, it limits budgetary discretionary spending or primary (non -interest) budgetary spending \\nand thereby cons trains the fiscal space for undertaking priority programmes in the public sector. \\nAccordingly, debt management reforms will be undertaken to make public borrowing cheaper and to help \\ndevelop domestic bond market. The Government will also continue to keep r ationalizing the interest rate \\nstructure of national savings instruments in line with interest rate developments in the money/bond market.  \\n \\n \\n  129 \\n 5.6 PUBLIC INVESTMENT PRIORITIES  \\nThe Government has a strong track record of expenditure control and prioritization, g iven the limited public \\nsector resource mobilization and the need to maintain macroeconomic stability. Using the available \\nresources effectively to ensure realization of the Eighth Plan social and economic objectives will be most \\nimportant. Ensuring qualit y of public spending will be the key to ensure appropriate economic and social \\nreturn on investment and also to invigorate private sector investment in the economy. Accordingly, the \\nGovernment will be paying enhanced attention to implementation capacity, g overnance and result -based \\nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) under the Plan.  \\nPublic investment priorities will be determined on the basis of recovery form COVID -19 and the realization \\nof key Eighth Plan targets with respect to real GDP growth, poverty reduc tion and social protection for the \\npoor and vulnerable, human resource development, enhancing social equity through inclusive growth and \\nensuring the sustainability of growth through continued macroeconomic stability. In addition, increasing \\namount of reso urces will be allocated to the investment programmes related to Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. \\nThe detail of total public investment and the amount of ADP in current prices and constant prices are \\nsummarized in Table 5.8. A sector wise summary of the proposed  sectoral allocations of planned public \\ninvestment in constant (FY21) and in current prices are shown in Tables 5.9 and 5.10, respectively. The \\nministry wide mapping of these allocations in current and constant prices is shown in Annex Tables 5.1 and \\n5.2. These are indicative allocations and will be reviewed in the context of annual budget cycles after taking \\ninto account actual availability of resources, programme implementation by the line ministries, and \\nchanging national priorities. Detailed sectoral ob jectives, Plan targets, strategies and policies to achieve the \\ntargets are discussed in sectoral chapters in Part 2 of the Eighth Plan document.  \\nTable 5.8: Public Investment Breakdown  \\nFiscal Year  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nTotal Public Investment to GDP (%)  8.2 8.2 8.7 8.9 9.2 \\nNominal Values  (In Billions of Taka, Current Market Price)  \\nTotal Public Investment  2573  2924  3503  4056  4801  \\n     of Which:       \\n      ADP investment  1800  2133  2622  3060  3675  \\nReal Values  (In Billions of Taka, FY21 Market Price)  \\nTotal Public Investment  2573  2788  3187  3524  3987  \\n     of Which:       \\n      ADP investment  1800  2033  2386  2659  3052  \\nMemo Item:       \\nNominal GDP, In Billions, Taka  31565  35661  40363  45776  51956  \\nGDP Deflator Index (FY21 Base)  100.0  104.9  109.9  115.1  120.4  \\nSource: GED Projections  \\n   130 \\n Table 5.9: 8FYP Sectoral ADP Allocations in Current Prices  \\nFiscal Year  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nSector  (In Billion Taka, Current \\nMarket Price)  120.6  139.2  161.3  192.9  \\nGeneral Public Services  96.1 283.8  332.0  368.8  423.9  \\nLocal Government and Rural \\nDevelopment  259.9  6.9 8.0 9.3 11.2 \\nDefense  5.6 51.8 59.7 69.8 83.8 \\nPublic Order and Safety  42.1 336.8  407.0  506.0  625.7  \\nEducation and Technology  267.4  218.4  278.8  340.8  408.9  \\nHealth  170.1  84.6 92.2 107.5  121.7  \\nSocial Security and Welfare  72.4 52.7 60.8 70.9 85.1 \\nHousing and Public Works  42.8 24.1 27.8 32.3 38.8 \\nRecreation, Culture and Religion  19.6 289.2  390.8  452.2  542.6  \\nPower and Energy  265.1  222.9  299.5  352.7  438.2  \\nAgriculture  165.9  11.5 13.3 15.5 18.6 \\nEnvironment  9.4 29.1 33.5 39.1 46.9 \\nIndustrial and Economic Services  23.6 400.3  479.8  533.9  637.0  \\nTransport and Communication  360.0  2132.7  2622.4  3060.1  3675.3  \\nTotal ADP Expenditure  1800.0      \\nMemorandum:   \\n35661  40363  45776  51956  \\nNominal GDP  31565      \\nSource: GED Project ions \\nTable 5.10: 8FYP Sectoral ADP Allocations in FY2021 Prices  \\nSector  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25    \\n(In Billion Taka, FY2021 Market Price)  \\nGeneral Public Services  96.1 114.7  125.5  139.9  160.1  \\nLocal Government and Rural Development  259.9  269.4  299.9  317.4 348.4  \\nDefense  5.6 6.6 7.2 8 9.2 \\nPublic Order and Safety  42.1 49.3 53.9 59.9 68.7 \\nEducation and Technology  267.4  319.7  367.5  435.6  514.2  \\nHealth  170.1  207.5  251.8  293.4  336.1  \\nSocial Security and Welfare  72.4 80.3 83.3 92.7 100 \\nHousing and Public Work s 42.8 50 54.9 61 69.9 \\nRecreation, Culture and Religion  19.6 22.9 25 27.9 31.9 \\nPower and Energy  265.1  274.4  353.1  389.3  445.9  \\nAgriculture  165.9  211.7  270.5  303.7  360.0  \\nEnvironment  9.4 11.0 12.0 13.4 15.3 \\nIndustrial and Economic Services  23.6 27.6 30.3 33.7 38.4 \\n Transport and Communication  360.0  387.8  451.5  482.6  553.6  \\nTotal ADP Expenditure  1800.0  2031.9  2386.4  2658.5  3051.7  \\nSource: GED Projections  \\n   131 \\n Table 5.11: 8FYP Sectoral ADP Allocations, As % of Total Development Expenditure  \\nSector  FY21  FY22  FY23 FY24  FY25    \\n(As % of Current Price Total ADP Expenditure)  \\nGeneral Public Services  5.3 5.7 5.3 5.3 5.2 \\nLocal Government and Rural Development  14.4 13.3 12.7 12.1 11.5 \\nDefense  0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 \\nPublic Order and Safety  2.3 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.3 \\nEducat ion and Technology  14.9 15.8 15.5 16.5 17.0 \\nHealth  9.5 10.2 10.6 11.1 11.1 \\nSocial Security and Welfare  4.0 4.0 3.5 3.5 3.3 \\nHousing and Public Works  2.4 2.5 2.3 2.3 2.3 \\nRecreation, Culture and Religion  1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 \\nPower and Energy  14.7 13.6 14.9 14.8 14.8 \\nAgriculture  9.2 10.5 11.4 11.5 11.9 \\nEnvironment  0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 \\nIndustrial and Economic Services  1.3 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.3 \\nTransport and Communication  20.0 18.8 18.3 17.4 17.3 \\nSource: GED Projections  \\n5.7 TOWARDS A SYNERGISTIC DEVELOPMENT PARTNER SHIP  \\nBangladesh’s target of becoming an UMIC calls for huge investments that needs to be financed from both \\ninternal and external sources. The recovery challenge from COVID -19 complicates this task and calls for \\nswift responses to restore human health and safety and enable a rapid resumption of normal economic \\nactivities.  Assistance from different development partners in the form of loan and grant is one of the major \\nsources of the country’s resource base. Though foreign assistance as percentage of GDP is declining, the \\nvolume is on steady rise in absolute terms. Thus, one of the key strategies of the 8FYP will be to ensure \\neffective partnership with development partners, especially multilateral development finance institutions to \\nmobilize swift COVID -19 as sistance and to ensure better use and results of existing pipeline and new loans.   \\nDifferent internal and international assessments and studies have shown that despite global commitments \\nand local measures, challenges to development effectiveness continue  in Bangladesh. The major challenges \\ninclude: (1) continued proliferation of stand -alone projects and aid fragmentation, (2) continued \\ncoordination challenges resulting in less alignment with sectoral plans (3) low harmonization and low use \\nof country syst ems, (4) despite improvements, low aid predictability, and (5) weak coordination between \\ngovernment agencies resulting in less coherent understanding of key issues of development cooperation \\nand inadequate leadership in policy dialogues.  \\nIn order to ensur e that foreign assistance delivers result, Bangladesh has established a formal mechanism \\nof partnership with development partners working in Bangladesh through the signing of a Joint Cooperation \\nStrategy (JCS) in 2010. Premised on the Paris Principles of a id effectiveness, the JCS primarily aims to \\ntranslate the international commitments on aid effectiveness at the country level.  Anchored in the JCS, \\nLocal Consultative Group (LCG) is the main platform for coordination between the government and DPs \\nis Bang ladesh.   132 \\n Bangladesh holds its dialogue with its DPs through the Bangladesh Development Forum (BDF) and the \\nLocal Consultative Group (LCG) Mechanism. The BDF is a high -level political forum that takes places \\nevery few years and includes not only the governm ent and the DPs, but also parliament, civil society, \\nacademia and private sector. The LCGs under different thematic areas are co -chaired by the \\nSecretary/Member of the Ministries/Division/Planning Commission and one DP. Government and DP high \\nlevel leaders hip in strengthening the coordination mechanism has allowed to firmly institutionalize the \\ncoordination system over the past years. The LCG now includes 18 working groups, each comprised of a \\ngovernment chair and a DP co -chair and focused on a specific nat ional development priority. Each group \\nis a forum to facilitate discussion and collaboration, to take decisions and move results in the priority \\nsectors. The regular LCG meetings have led to a more regular constructive development dialogue and have \\nsignifi cantly improved the relations between DPs and the government. During the 8th Five Year Plan period, \\ngovernment will continue its efforts to strengthen the JCS and the LCG, keeping up with the evolving \\npartnership needs.  \\nThe 8FYP aims at more vibrant and s ynergistic partnership by addressing the current challenges that inhibit \\nthe effectiveness of development cooperation. However, a synergistic partnership requires a number of \\nthings to be implemented by the government. A top priority is speed up the use of  existing pipeline, focusing \\nspecifically on slow -moving problem projects to restructure and speed up implementation. The 8FYP \\nenvisages that all DPs will align their country assistance strategies with the goals and sectoral targets of the \\nGovernment. Lead ership of government line ministries in the LCG sectoral working group is key to ensure \\nDP policy alignment and system harmonization. The ERD as development assistance coordinator should \\nmap comprehensive work plan to reach out to all government line minis tries to ensure that they all are on \\nthe same wave length when dealing with foreign assistance.  \\nThe government is proactively creating enabling environment for disclosure of public documents with the \\nenactment of Right to Information Act and establishment  of the independent Information Commission. It \\nis important that the public has the access to aid data and project documents to ensure aid transparency and \\naccountability. The 8FYP stipulates that all aid data be made public and the Aid Information Managem ent \\nSystem (AIMS) should be the principal means of data sharing by DPs in Bangladesh.  \\n5.8 RISK AND CHALLENGES  \\nPublic sector resource mobilization has always been the most important constraint to expanding the \\ninvestment programme to meet the growing infrastru cture demand, and to finance the needs of public \\nspending in education, health and social protection. The revenue targets established for the national Board \\nof Revenue are ambitious, but supported by proper policy and administrative reforms and automation of \\ntax administration the targets are certainly attainable. The major challenge will be in changing the culture \\nof outdated practices associated with NBR revenue administration and steadily moving toward a modern \\nIT-based administration of the VAT and inco me tax systems. Effective implementation of the NBR \\nmodernization Plan including automation of the VAT and direct tax administration will be preconditions \\nfor the success of the domestic revenue mobilization strategy.  \\nProjections for external financing ar e reasonable and broadly in line with the borrowing pattern observed \\nin recent years. While the size of external borrowing will continue to rise in dollar terms, in relative terms \\nthere will be a significant further reduction in the reliance on external fi nancing of the budget during the  133 \\n Plan period, broadly in line with the pattern observed in recent years under the Seventh Plan. The sustained \\nreduction of external debt and debt service payments in relation to GDP and exports of goods and \\nremittances, resp ectively, would certainly reduce Bangladesh’s vulnerability to external shocks. Such an \\nimprovement in the external debt and debt service outlook would also enhance Bangladesh’s capacity to \\nservice its external obligations and would allow it to access inte rnational capital market if the Government \\ndesires to do so.  \\nThere should not be any major problem with the financing of the Plan from the domestic bank and nonbank \\nsources. The projected domestic borrowing under the Plan is consistent with credit needs o f the private \\nsector and inflation targets. Nevertheless, because the planned domestic borrowing from these two sources \\nwill be sizable, it will require better coordination between monetary and fiscal policy in order to avoid any \\npotential scope for crowdi ng out of private sector credit. The sources of domestic financing and the interest \\nrates paid on non -bank borrowing would need to be rationalized with the developments in the market -based \\ninterest rate structure and the sources of domestic borrowing shoul d also be widened with a view to reducing \\nthe rapidly growing domestic debt servicing burden. Development of domestic bond market with proper \\ndevelopment of the regulatory regime and the demand and supply side of the domestic bond market will be \\nimportant for diversifying the domestic financing sources.  \\n  134 \\n CHAPTER 5: ANNEX TABLES  \\nTable A5.1: Ministry -Wise 8FYP Annual Development Programme Allocation  (Taka Billion)  \\nFiscal Year  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25

Evaluation \\n(RBM&E) instead of assessing completion of financial or physical targets as indicators of progress. This \\nresults -based M&E system has been incorporated to flexibly use as an instrument of securing mid -term \\ncorrections. This RBM&E i s also used to link the successive five year plans to each other by looking at the \\nresults achieved in each medium -term plan and identifying the gaps. The gaps will then inform the agenda, \\npolicies and strategies of the next five -year plan. The 8FYP covers  the development aspiration of the \\ncountry incorporating the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although the unexpected \\nand unprecedented onslaught of the COVID -19 global pandemic has disrupted the upward and accelerating \\npattern of the d evelopment progress, the flexible use of the planning instrument will seek to contain the \\ndamage and restore the development momentum as indicated by the Development Results Framework \\n(DRF) of the 8FYP.  \\nThe experience of developing DRF of the 6FYP and the 7FYP gave opportunity to develop more rigorous \\nDRF for the 8FYP emphasizing on aligning SDGs indicators as well. The findings of the implementation \\nreview of 6th Five Year Plan and Mid Term Review of 7th Five Year Plan has been considered in formulating \\nthe government policies as well as the formulation of the 8FYP. The objective of this brief chapter is to \\ndiscuss the strategy underlying the DRF for the 8FYP, its strategic role in planning, the institutional \\narrangements for results -based monitoring, data mobilization arrangements, mid -term and end evaluation \\nof the plan.  \\n6.2 TOWARDS A RESULTS -BASED M&E SYSTEM: 8FYP STRATEGY  \\nBased on the progress made with results -based monitoring in the 6FYP and the 7FYP, the strategic content \\nand relevance of the DRF in the  planning process has gained significance. In the specific context of Vision \\n2041 and the 8FYP, a results -based M&E is recognized as critical to helping the Government track and \\nmonitor progress and take corrective measures when major gaps or divergences e merge.  \\nThe importance of generating the relevant database to do proper results -based monitoring and evaluation \\nhas also gained recognition. This has enabled the development of a detailed DRF, which includes the \\nfollowing:  \\n\\uf0b7 Identifies core macroeconomic and  sectoral development objectives linked to PP2041 and the \\nSDGs;  \\n\\uf0b7 Indicates the different monitorable indicators;  \\n\\uf0b7 Identifies the data source;  \\n\\uf0b7 Indicates the responsible line ministry/ agency that should prepare the data;    \\n\\uf0b7 Defines a baseline and sets target s for the end -year as well as the intermediate years of the 8FYP.   140 \\n  \\nA total of 15 top priority areas have been defined, of which 4 are macroeconomic in nature and the other \\n11 are sectoral. Each of these development goals are linked to the SDG and fully con sistent with the \\ndevelopment vision and target set by the government in PP2041. Table 6.1 contains national priority areas \\nand the number of indicators used for measuring performance. Performance of the 8FYP will be assessed \\nagainst progress towards these developments using 104 measurable indicators. The detailed listing of \\nindicators, base -line data and the yearly targets are contained in the attachment to this chapter shown as \\nAnnex 1.  \\nTable 6.1: National Priority Areas of the 8FYP  \\nNational Priority  Outc ome Statement  Indicators  No. of \\nIndictors  \\nA.

The balance between economic and social just ice and strategic linkages \\nbetween the macroeconomic and sectoral goals are clearly articulated.  It gives a summary snapshot of the \\nmain features of the 8FYP and identifies the performance indicators that, if achieved, will give confidence \\nthat the plan w ell implemented.  \\n6.3 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR M&E  \\nThe M&E framework in the 6FYP was postulated as a dynamic process. It was understood that the lessons \\nfrom international experience on good practices, while certainly helpful in starting the process in the  right \\ndirection, would need to be tailored to the Bangladesh context.  \\n6.3.1  M&E Role of General Economics Division (GED) of the Planning Commission  \\nGED is the focal point for monitoring and evaluation of mid and long -term plans. The focus on M&E has \\nhelped in converting the development plans from once -in-a-five-year document to more of a living strategy \\nthat gets updated in the context of a mid -term review and then links up with the next plan through the final \\nplan completion review.   142 \\n In addition to this, the GED will review the “National Action Plan of Ministries/Divisions by Targets in the \\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” that was developed in alignment with the \\n7FYP. Based on the review of the National SDG Action Plan and feedbacks  from the consultation with the \\nministries/divisions/agencies, revised National SDG Action Plan will be prepared by identifying projects \\nand programmes that would be undertaken during FY2021 -FY2025 to achieve the development aspiration \\nof the 8FYP. Along w ith the DRF of the 8FYP, the National SDG Action Plan will also be used as an M&E \\ntool to review the progress of implementation of this mid -term plan document (8FYP).  \\nThe training of government officials on the 7FYP provided by the GED was a milestone work  that not only \\nenhanced the capacity of the public officials but also strengthened the M&E system within ministries, \\ndivisions and agencies. The GED will continue such training even for a larger audience on the 8FYP for \\neffective understanding and operatio nalization of the result -based M&E system. Moreover, the GED will \\nhelp develop M&E framework for the sector strategies to line ministries so that each ministry knows its \\ncommitments and the benchmark against which performance will be evaluated.  \\nThe adopti on of the medium -term budgetary framework (MTBF) and assigning this role the Ministry of \\nFinance has strengthened the link between the budget and the national plan on the one hand and between \\nmacroeconomic and sectoral programmes  on the other through the i nvolvement of sectoral line ministries. \\nThe Planning Commission rightly focuses on developing a nation -wide M&E framework in coordination \\nwith the Ministry of Finance and the line ministries. The main M&E focus is on high level outcomes related \\nto the impl ementation of the national plans and major policies. This aggregate -level M&E effort needs to \\nbe complemented with two other levels of results -based M&E:  sectoral M&Es conducted by line Ministries \\nand M&E of individual investment projects done by the Impl ementation Monitoring and Evaluation \\nDivision (IMED) under the Ministry of Planning.  \\n6.3.2  Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED)  \\nThe IMED has made some progress in doing systematic review of the entire project portfolio to distil the \\nkey lessons of project selection and management and strengthen the development impact of the public \\ninvestment program. Nevertheless, there is substantial scope for further progress.  The importance of doing \\na through portfolio of the ADP and find ways how t o maximize the development impact of public \\ninvestment has gained momentum in an environment of resource constraint, that has been further \\naggravated by the COVID -19.    \\nIMED will undertake an increased number of impact assessments of projects with the hel p of both \\nexperimental and non -experimental data so that M&E at the micro -level moves beyond simply tracking the \\nfinancial and physical completion of the projects.  The IMED will develop its capacity and learning through \\na process of research and collabora tion with the national think tanks and the universities.  \\n6.3.3  Line Ministries/Divisions  \\nThe line Ministries/divisions are critical actors in revamping the M&E system. The Planning Wing of the \\nline ministries is responsible to carry out the job. Some prog ress has been made during the 7FYP in this \\nregard, but internal capacities need considerable strengthening. While line ministries/divisions participate \\nactively in the plan development and implementation process, a systematic effort is not fully in place. The  143 \\n required database is often not in place and the input to the planning process is often not strategic or based \\non a solid analysis of progress made in the previous plan, emerging gaps and how they will be filled. The \\nline ministries have made better pro gress in developing medium -term budgetary framework, but the link of \\nthe budget requests to sectoral strategies in the medium -term plan or the perspective plans has to be \\nstrengthened.  \\nTo ensure that line Ministries become an important agent for the M&E e xercise, the following steps will be \\nundertaken under the 8FYP. First, a capacity building plan will be developed which will pinpoint how line \\nministries will design an M&E strategy. Second, revision of existing good practice for a results -based M&E \\nfrom r elevant international experience so that some lessons can be drawn to improve the existing results - \\nbased M&E system of line Ministries. Third, the planning wings of line ministries will be strengthened with \\ntrained officials and technology to prepare proj ect performance reports and results data. Finally, line \\nministries will be encouraged to mobilize the relevant sectoral data and put that into the respective websites.  \\n6.3.4  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\nAt the national level, the Bangladesh Burea u of Statistics (BBS) is the official data institution in \\nBangladesh according to the Statistical Act 2013. The role of the BBS has evolved and over time the BBS \\nhas developed substantial experience and competence in providing a range of data at a national , district, \\nand sectoral level. Yet, it is well -known that the BBS needs substantial strengthening. Indeed, given the \\nimportance of information as a public good, the strengthening of the BBS is probably the topmost priority \\nfor improving policy making, for  improving research, and for instituting a results -based M&E. Under the \\n8FYP, the BBS will be greatly strengthened to generate high quality data in a timely fashion. To overcome \\nsuch constraints, the GoB will undertake the following initiatives:  \\nFirst, BBS  produced and published an actionable National Strategy for the Development of the Statistics \\n(NSDS) report with strategic directions, policies and institutional reforms for strengthening the BBS. Some \\nprogress was made in the implementation of the NSDS un der the Seventh Plan, but progress was \\nconstrained by the slowdown in the procurement of the required technical assistance to strengthen BBS \\ncapacity.   \\nSecond, the BBS will undertake small scale surveys for enabling regular and frequent monitoring and \\nevaluation exercise. Given financial as well as capacity constraint, it is difficult to conduct annual surveys \\nin a large scale. The alternative therefore is to conduct interim surveys at much smaller scale both in terms \\nof coverage of the sample as well as n umbers of areas covered. These surveys will typically serve the \\npurpose of adding interim data points to the existing large - scale surveys and thereby enabling regular \\nmonitoring of selected indicators. Given the required cost of annual surveys, biannual s urveys will be \\nconducted which will enable much better tracking of performance given the cost constrain.  \\nThird, the government will dedicate substantial resources to improving the system of national accounts. \\nAdditionally, the BBS needs to focus on produc ing GDP data on a quarterly basis. This will allow \\npolicymakers to evaluate the effects of changes in fiscal and monetary policies on a real time basis. Statistics \\nand Informatics Division is mandated for preparing National Population Register (NPR) accord ing to the \\nAllocation of Business, 1996 (revised up to April 2017), Statistics Act 2013 and National Strategy for the \\nDevelopment of Statistics (NSDS). As a National Statistics Office, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  144 \\n will prepare and update the NPR t o provide information of each and every individual of the  country with a \\nunique identification number for ensuring effective service delivery.  \\nFourth, as Bangladesh moves towards a more decentralized approach to public administration and service \\ndelivery, there is need to have much better understanding of production and financial capacities at the \\ndistrict level. Long time ago, BBS used to prepare district level GDP.  It also used to prepare fiscal accounts \\nof local government institutions (LGIs). BBS will take initiative to start compiling district level production \\nand fiscal accounts of LGIs.  \\nFinally, strong emphasis will be given to strengthening the quality of BBS data. Surveys are done on a \\nrange of subjects including household incomes and wages.  \\nImple mentation Reviews of Eighth Five Year Plan  \\n\\uf0a7 Two M&E reviews will be conducted during the 8FYP to assess the degree of achievement against \\ntargets set in the plan document. The first review would be a Mid -Term Review and the second \\nreview would be the Final/ End Review of the 8FYP.  \\n\\uf0a7 The Mid Term Review will be conducted in FY2023.  This will allow the government to take stock \\nof achievements at midpoint, review the risks and assumptions, and to make any necessary \\nadjustment to the remaining years’ strategies.  \\n\\uf0a7 The findings of Final/End Review of the 8FYP will be disseminated through workshops with \\nstakeholders. The dissemination effort will include sending the reports to all the stakeholders.  \\nSustainability of Results -based M&E System  \\nThe sustainability of the  results -based M&E system depends on a number of factors. First, the public policy \\narena must harness a genuine demand and appreciation for an effective results -based M&E system.  Second, \\nofficial channels for collecting information should be maintained an d their dissemination must occur in a \\nuser-friendly manner. Third, there is inherent need to ensure accountability of the government to own the \\nM&E effort. By ensuring accountability of all the ministries/division, autonomous bodies, central and local \\ngove rnment bodies, government can ensure both the demand and the incentives for a results -based M&E. \\nFinally, continuous capacity building efforts are necessary.    \\n \\n145 \\n CHAPTER 6: ANNEX TABLES  \\nTable A6.1: Development Results Framework (DRF) of the 8th Five Year Pla n \\nSL

\\nThe transformative aspiration articulated in PP2041 has become more challenging due to the economic \\nrealities associated with the Covid -19 global pandemic. Yet the objective to accelerate growth and maintain \\nits momentum for the next  two decades necessitates that the policymakers maintain macroeconomic \\nstability, mobilize sufficient resources for high quality human capital and critical infrastructure and develop \\nnecessary manufacturing and service sectors that cou ld cater to the world  market. Alongside, as emphasized \\nin PP2041, important gains will need to be made on the institutional and governance  fronts. The government \\nunderstands that the governance and the institutional structures of UMIC and HIC are vastly different from \\nthose fo und in low income and LMIC countries.       \\nHistorical and comparative development experiences suggest that long -term developmental transformation \\nfrom low income and LMIC status to UMIC and HIC status has only been possible when the policymakers \\nformulate d and invested in effective institutions within the economic and political  space that allowed \\nmarkets to function efficiently and allowed the state to mobilize resources for delivering necessary public \\ngoods, while operating within a broad environment of p olitical accountability and rule of law. In particular, \\nthe broad evidence emerging from the literature on institutional economics pinpoints that some aspects of \\neconomic and political institutions are extremely important for maintaining long -term growth, as they play \\na critical role in shaping the incentives of economic actors by rewarding greater efficiency, competitiveness, \\nstability and innovation in the overall economy.  \\nConsequently, the Government has recognized this instrumental relevance of effecti ve institutions to attain \\nlong-run rapid economic transformation and has accordingly targeted key institutional and governance \\nimprovements under the Sixth and Seventh Plans so that the policymakers can mobilize the required \\ninvestments in physical and hum an capital, foster innovation and technological advances, and promote the \\norganization of production systems. The Seventh Plan, in particular, articulated a focused intervention to \\nnavigate contemporary challenges and identified key areas that will be targ eted for key institutional reforms. \\nThis included reforms in: (a) the capacity of the public administration; (b) judiciary; (c) financial sector; \\nand (d) local government. More specifically, the 7th Plan place d empowerment of citizens at the centre of \\nits development strategy as reflected in the subtitle (tag line) of the document: ‘Accelerating Growth, \\nEmpowering Citizens.’ Seemingly, the ‘theory of change’ implied by the governance paradigm of the 7th \\nPlan may be described along the following lines: impro ving and strengthening institutions would accelerate \\neconomic growth and poverty reduction which in turn would create assets and capabilities, thus \\nempowering the poor, which would feed back to demand for better living standards and good governance.  \\n   \\n \\n162 \\n The Eighth Plan will maintain this focused approach to improve institutional performance – which has also \\nemerged as priority area within the political manifesto of the Government.  In particular, the Government \\nrecognizes that while approaching the 8th Plan’s governance priorities, it is important to keep in view that \\nthere is a large body of evidence to suggest that reform and change in these areas is a complex process \\ninvolving deep structural and behavioural changes, and hence, are difficult to achieve witho ut strong and \\nconsistent political support at all levels sustained over long periods of time.  Finally, to address the \\ndeficiencies in other relevant areas relating to governance, the 8th Plan will also prioritize the strategies and \\npolicies that were iden tified in the 7th Plan and are still considered for attaining the developmental \\ntransformation that are envisioned in the Perspective Plan 2041.  \\n1.2 GOVERNANACE PERFORMANCES DURING THE SEVENTH PLAN  \\n1.2.1  Institutional Performance under  the 6th and 7th Plans  \\nThe cross -country comparison of progress in institutional performance and governance is usually measured \\nby numerous international composite indicators, but prominent among those are the “ World Governance \\nIndicators”, which compare institutional performance s across six key dimensions. These are: Voice and \\nAccountability, Political  Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, \\nRegulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. Moreover, in the standard governance \\nliterature, these indicators are frequently used to assess how institutional performance is changing over both \\ntime and space. Bangladesh’s performance, evaluated through these indicators remains mixed over the last \\ndecade as moderate improvements in some dimensions h ave coexisted with continued weakness in others. \\nIn fact, if we examine the institutional performance as illustrated in Table 1.1, we can see Bangladesh \\nrelative position has only moderately improved in three indicators – namely, ‘Control of Corruption’, ‘ Rule \\nof Law’ and ‘Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism’ – while remaining less than par in \\nother key areas such as ‘Voice and Accountability’, ‘Government Effectiveness’ and ‘Regulatory Quality’.  \\nFurthermore, even when we assess objective  indicators that measures specific institutional performance \\nassociated with the fiscal capacity to mobilize recourses, the judicial capacity to maintain a tolerable \\nbacklog  of cases and the central bank’s regulatory capacity to contain nonperforming loans  in both state -\\nowned commercial banks and the overall banking sector, the trend between 2010 and 2019 appears less \\nthan encouraging. For instance, the total backlog of cases between 2010 and 2019 has been doubled and it \\nis approximately 3.6 million (Table 1.2). This is higher than the target that was decided under the 7FYP  to \\nlimit case backlog to 3.3 million in 2020. This is also indicative of limited change in the case disposal rate, \\nwhich was a priority area of improvement in both the 6FYP and the 7FYP. Likewise, if we observe the \\ntrend in Tax -to-GDP ratio, both the 6FYP and 7FYP aimed to increase the Tax -to-GDP to more than 15% \\nduring their respective tenures. Yet, it actually decreased from 9 .21% in FY2010 to 8. 9% in FY2019, which \\nunderscores the urgent  need to prioritize major fiscal reforms to enhance the Government’s capacity to \\nmobilize resources and meet its developmental needs.   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n163 \\n Table 1.1: The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI):  Bangladesh    \\nIndicator Name  \\nPercentile Rank  2010 Rank  2018 Ran k \\nControl of Corruption  14.76  16.83  \\nGovernment Effectiveness  26.32  21.63  \\nPolitical Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism  9.95 13.81  \\nRegulatory Quality  22.01  19.23  \\nRule of Law  25.59  28.37  \\nVoice and Accountability  36.97  27.59  \\nSource: WGI, World Bank , 2019. \\nTable 1.2: Domestic Indicators of Institutional Performance  \\n \\n2010 2019  \\n1.

Between FY 2012 and FY 2018, the Government had to invest approximately 129 trilli on \\nTaka to recapitalize State -Owned Banks , as Non -Performing Loans (NPL) witnessed a secular increase in \\nboth the State -Owned Commercial Banks and in the overall banking sector. In fact, the NPL targets for the \\nentire banking sector were only met in FY 2020 after the Bangladesh Bank accommodated a restructuring \\nof more than 300 trillion Taka worth of credit by allowing the large borrowers to reschedule their loans. \\nThis, however, does not address the underlying challenges of governance in the banking sector.  As a result, \\nthe Government has a strong political determination to reduce Non -Performing Loans in the banking sector  \\nunder the 8FYP and initiate noticeable governance related reforms to improve management in the financial \\nsector. Reform efforts will also  be prioritized for the capital market, which has also experienced some \\nturbulence during the 7FYP and there is a growing lack of confidence in the capital  market . Policymakers \\nrecognize that an efficient capital market is an instrumental mechanism for mob ilizing long -term \\ninvestments for the private sector, which makes them committed towards strong institutional reforms in the \\nfinancial sector to improve the state of economic governance under the 8FYP.    \\nThe general track record of Bangladesh in offering a sound economic environment – as measured by the \\nDoing Business Indicators - has also been less than satisfactory.  Bangladesh  has generally received low \\nposition in the ease of doing business index. However, t his issue  received significant attention by th e \\ngovernment in 2016, which motivated to form the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) \\nunder the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Act 2016. The sole objective of this \\npublic body is to promote institutional and policy reform s across the board that can facilitate private \\ninvestment and improve the ease of doing business. The ‘Doing Business Indicators’ constitute numerous \\nessential dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local firms. It offers quantitative me ans \\nto assess regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering \\nproperty, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing   \\n \\n164 \\n contracts and resolving insolvenc y. Thus, the ‘Doing Business’ framework offers a multi -dimensional \\nassessment of the economic environment by assessing the quality of the institutional framework.  \\nFurthermore, in 2019, Bangladesh gained an eight -notch jump in the global rankings due to th e measures \\nidentified by BIDA as an obstacle  for businesses (See: Table 1.3). This is a positive but moderate \\nachievement, especially if we compare Bangladesh to the improvements that were experienced by China \\nand India. Bangladesh, in particular, performs  poorly in offering better legal arrangements for registering \\nproperties and enforcing contracts, which highlights weakness of the legal framework for the commercial \\nspace – and it remains an avenue where more concentrated efforts are necessary. The rankin gs, on the \\nwhole, highlight that the room for improvement is still large.  \\nTable 1.3: Performance in Ease of Doing Business  Index  \\n \\n2017  2018  2019  \\n1.

In addition, empirical literature on the determinants of long -run growth and \\neconomic prosperity has offered a robust body of evidence indicating that institutional reforms which \\nimprove macroeconomic and political stability, the mobilization of  resources and investments in public \\ngood and human capital are the fundamental determinants of long -run development. Consequently, if \\nBangladesh aims to fulfil the targets which it has laid out in the Perspective Plan 2021 -2041, then effective \\ninstitution al reforms are mandatory under the 8FYP .    \\nIn terms of democratic governance, Bangladesh  experienced a peaceful execution of the 11th Parliamentary \\nElection in 2018 and the Election Commission is routinely performing both local and city elections in a \\ntimely fashion. The recent introduction of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) in the Dhaka South City \\nCorporation, Dhaka North City Corporation and Ch attogram  City Corporation elections has also improved \\ntransparency in the electoral process substantially as it  has helped improving the  management of the \\nelectoral process. Additionally, Bangladesh also witnessed a large improvement in the direct representation \\nof women in the Parliament – as the 11th National Election witnessed twenty -two directly elected female \\nmembers – the highest in the country’s history. Besides, direct representation was a mere 2% in the 8th \\nParliament and 6% in both 9th and 10th Parliaments, but it is more than 7% in the 11th Parliament. This \\nshould ideally improve the state of voice of wom en in policy  making. The National Parliament has also \\nseen a decrease in the tendency to boycott the Parliament in both the 10th and 11th National Parliament as \\nvarious Parliamentary Committees are routinely debating and scrutinizing the policy issues -impr oving the \\noverall state of effectiveness of the National Parliament.  The good performance of Bangladesh in ensuring \\nbetter female participation in the political arena has received global recognition. For example, in the Global \\nGender Gap Report 2020 prepa red by the World Economic Forum, Bangladesh ranked 7 out of 153 \\ncountries in political empowerment.      \\n \\n165 \\n 1.2.2  Specific Achievement under  the Seventh Plan  \\nAccess to Justice:  The Government of Bangladesh is committed to improve access to justice for the poor \\nand marginalized people. Moreover, one of the key instruments through which access to justice is ensured \\nis by offering legal  aid; and to provide legal aid for those who are incapable of seeking justice due to \\nfinancial insolvency, destitution, helplessnes s, etc. District Legal Aid Offices, Supreme Court Legal Aid \\nOffice, two Labour Court Legal Aid Cells and National Helpline Call Centre are established to ensure \\naccess to government legal aid services under the National Legal Aid Services Organization  (NLA SO). In \\nFY2019, a total number of 100,806 beneficiaries have received government legal aid services through the \\nNLASO. This is much higher than the target that was laid down in the 7FYP, which aimed to provide legal \\naid to at least 37,000 victims annually by 2020. In fact, between 2009 and 2019, nearly half a million people \\nreceived legal aid service and it highlights the government’s commitment to improve the state of access to \\njustice in Bangladesh.  More precisely, the total number of legal aid recipient s was  82,000 and 100,806 in \\nFY2017 -18 and FY2018 -19, respectively (NLASO Annual Report 2018 -19). The opening up of a national \\nhotline played a crucial role reaching the large numbers. The village courts are currently operational in 27 \\ndistricts and their c ase disposal rate is high. The National Legal Aid Services Organisation (NLASO ) is \\nproviding services in 64 districts through the District Legal Aid Offices along with a national hotline.  The \\nGovernment has also prioritized improving the capacity of judici al institutions to undertake Alternate \\nDispute Resolution (ADR) along with enhancing public awareness of such mechanism. The 7th Plan target \\nwas to settle at least 25000 disput es annually through ADR by 2020 –a milestone that has been attained \\nprior to 2020 .  \\nAccess to Law:  To ensure proper implementation, all law implementing agencies and people in general \\nmust have knowledge  about concerned laws. To facilitate this, all updated laws are provided in the website \\n(laws of Bangladesh) of the Legislative and Pa rliamentary Affairs Division. About 300 important laws have \\nbeen translated from Bengali to English and vice versa and are available in the website  \\nCapacity strengthening  of the Judiciary: The capacity strengthening of judicial institutions has been an \\narea of key concern for the Government as it recognizes the increasing need for well -trained judges and \\njudicial officials for enhancing the performance of the judiciary. To this end, under the 7th Plan period, more \\nthan 700 judges were trained in foreign des tinations: 253 judges were trained in Australia; 60 in Japan; and \\n250 in India. Furthermore, to ensure the judiciary benefits from effective planning, critical data was \\ngenerated though a detailed audit of the national justice system in 2018.1 The first of  its kind audit \\nconstitutes a data -driven account of the country’s entire criminal justice system ranging from crime and \\npolicing through court adjudication and finally to sentencing and prison custody. It spans the activities and \\noperation, as well as res ources and governance, of numerous institutions across several ministries. This is \\na critical accomplishment which will considerably enhance the Government’s monitoring and evaluation \\ncapacity at the sectoral level.   Lastly, the Government has also upgrade d the physical infrastructure of \\njudicial institutions by planning to add 42 new Magistrates Courts, of which 30 were completed as of 2019. \\nMoreover, 27 Judge Courts were vertically expanded, 23 new land sub -Registry office buildings have \\nalready been comp leted. Construction of Annex Build -2 of Bangladesh Supreme Court also commenced in \\n2019, which will add 32 new court rooms to existing facilities.   \\n                                                     \\n1  See: https://bangladesh.justiceaudit.org/    \\n \\n166 \\n Annual Performance Agreement (APA):  Under the 7th Plan period, the Government has remained \\ncommitted to the  regular use of an effective “Governance Performance Management System (GPMS)” by \\nformulating and annually using the “Annual Performance Agreement - (APA)”, which helps ensure a \\nsystematic performance review of all ministries/ divisions.  The government intro duced  APA in FY2015 to \\nenhance efficiency and accountability in government organizations. The issue of evaluating the \\nperformance of employees and public organizations was also emphasized in the Civil Service Act, 2018. \\nDuring the 7FYP  period APA has been expanded up to Upazila level and covered more than 17000 \\ngovernment offices. APAMS software has been upgraded to facilitate APA preparation, monitoring and \\nevaluation. In FY2019 the average score of the ministries/divisions in APA implementation was 86.5%.  \\nBased on the performance in APA implementation, reward system has been introduced at all level of the \\npublic organizations. This has created a healthy competition among the public organizations regarding \\nperformance. During this period, APA has been able to increase the transparency and accountability of \\npublic organizations. It also supported in improving financial management of the public organizations. \\nMoreover, the implementation of the vision of the government including SDGs has been accelerated \\nthrou gh APA.  This system has been flourished and started to create impact in case of organizational \\nperformance management under the effective coordination and supervision of the Cabinet Division. \\nMoreover, the Cabinet Secretary is steering the National Committ ee on Government Performance (NCGP) \\nand annually signs Ministry/Division -specific APA and monitors the completion rate of the agreed upon \\nannual work plan . On the whole, under 7th Plan, APA has been sufficiently operationalized to meet its \\ndesired objectiv e. \\nReducing Violence Against Women: The Multi -Sectoral Program on Violence Against Women (MSP -\\nVAW) under the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (M oWCA) runs eight One -stop Crisis Centres  \\n(OCCs) at the division levels and 60 One -stop Crisis Cells (OCCs)  to provide information and referral \\nservices to the victims of VAW. This initiative is carried out in order to provide all required services to the \\nwomen and child victim of violence at one place. The data show that since its formation, 16,804 victims \\nhave been treated at the OCC s, of which only 3,747 victims took legal action against the responsible \\noffenders, which implies that 78% opted not to take legal action. Importantly, it seems the OCCs function \\nmainly as medical centres  since legal and counsellin g services are mostly absent.   \\nImproved Village Court Performance: The village courts in the project areas received 176,122 cases, of \\nwhich 144,125 cases were resolved from July 2017 to February 2020. Th is informal institution is proving \\nto be quite effect ive in delivering justice even though there is still a long way to go. A survey by BRAC \\nInstitute of Governance and Development in 2019 found that beneficiaries who seek legal services, are not \\nfully aware of the jurisdiction of the village court.   The sur vey also found that a large number of disputes \\nin the rural community are related to land but many of these cannot be resolved in village courts because \\nland values are typically higher than the limit of Tk. 75,000, above which they have no authority to \\narbitration. Enforcement is generally weak.  \\nImproved Case Coordination Committee Performance:  The introduction of Case Coordination \\nCommittees (CCC) at district level has succeeded in bringing together key justice system actors on a regular \\nbasis to address  local problems related to prison overcrowding and case congestion. Along with Police and \\nMagistrates, the CCCs play an important role in joining up the justice system to ensure each service provider \\ntalks to the others and avoid  operating in siloes.    \\n \\n167 \\n Impro ved Performance of the Public Accounts Committee in the Parliament:  There have been \\nimprovements in the functioning of Public Accounts Committee. Notably, the Public Accounts Committee \\nheld the highest number of times to discuss the matters of concern . \\nIncreased Use of Medium -Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF):  The Government rolled out the \\nbudget based on the Medium -Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) to strengthen institutionalization of a \\nstrategic and policy -based approach to budgeting. The MTBF contributed to  the further development of \\nForward Baseline Estimates (FBEs) of ministry -wise expenditure. This enabled the government to keep \\nfiscal deficit within 5 percent of GDP.  \\nImproved Transparency in Fiscal Data:   During the 7th Plan, the Integrated Budget and Ac counting \\nSystem (IBAS++) was installed to enhance  the accuracy of financial data. To ensure transparency of the \\ngovernment’s fiscal position, public debt statistics were published on a regular basis. T he Ministry of \\nFinance introduced the Integrated Financ ial Management Information System (IFMIS)  to produce accurate \\nestimates of its financial statement in due time. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of \\nBangladesh (OCAG) and the World Bank were involved in the implementation of the IFMIS.  In keeping \\nwith ‘Digital Bangladesh’ initiative, the Government also digitalized aid and debt management to ensure \\ngreater transparency and mutual accountability. This digital system is embedded in Debt Management and \\nFinancial Analysis System (DMFAS), Assista nce Information Management System (AIMS) and Foreign \\nAssistance Management System (FAMS) platforms maintained by the Economic Relations Division.   \\nImplementation of the Public Investment Management (PIM) Agenda:  Under the 7FYP period, the \\nPlanning Commissi on developed and validated a set of new Public Investment Management (PIM) tools. \\nThese PIM tools include: i) Ministry Assessment Format (MAF), ii) Sector Appraisal Format (SAF), iii) \\nSector Strategy Paper (SSP) and iv) Multi -Year Public Investment Program me (MYPIP). The MAF and \\nSAF contribute to the PIM reform agenda by ensuring that the Development Project Proposal (DPP) is \\ncomprehensively assessed by relevant Ministries/Divisions and appraised by Sector Divisions of the \\nPlanning Commission before any pro ject is approved . The SSP, which provided a comprehensive overview \\nof sector goals, performance, opportunities and challenges, was developed and validated  for two sectors, \\nnamely: (i) Local Government and Rural Development Sector, and (ii) Power and Energy  Sector.  The PC \\nalso developed and validated a Multi -Year Public Investment Programme (MYPIP) in the two pilot sectors. \\nThe MYPIP is aimed to improve allocation of development budget among sectors and projects. In addition, \\nthe Government established the P IM Reform Wing (PIMRW) within the Programming Division in 2018 to \\ncoordinate the PIM reform. Furthermore, the Programming Division has completed the development of the \\nnew database management system for ADP in 2019 and will make the system  fully operationa l from 2020 \\nonward.    \\nProgress with E -Governance: E-governance allows citizens to communicate effectively with the \\ngovernment and allows them to experience public services digitally. It also facilitates a citizen’s capacity \\nto participate in the governmen t’s policymaking process. Furthermore, the Government has already laid \\ndown comprehensive e -Administration goals  in both the 6FYP  and 7FYP . And acting upon those plans, the \\nGovernment has made all necessary information of the Ministries available through v arious websites which \\nare completely accessible to the public. In addition, the Government has trained more than 50,000 public \\nofficials to maintain these websites and update data and information regularly. The Government has also \\nintroduced a national por tal containing information from all the Ministries, while e -Service centres were   \\n \\n168 \\n introduced at the District level enabling the Districts to share information online. Moreover, a National \\nData Centre facilitating the dissemination of National Identification  (NID) Cards and voter lists has been \\nestablished and made operational. The Government has also established the National ICT Infra -Network \\nfor Bangladesh Government Phase II, and has implemented 800 video conferencing systems at different \\nMinistries, Depar tments and Upazila offices. Due to its observed success, the project has now received an \\nextension for its third phase, where it will be more citizens  centric and deliver higher bandwidth. \\nAdditionally, successful implementation of the project will ensure 10Gbps capacity network at the Upazila \\nlevels and 100 Gbps capacity networks  at the District levels. In key institutions such as the former Board \\nof Investment ( BoI) now renamed as the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), the \\nGovernment has introduced the system of online registration and work permits for foreign nationals and \\ninvestors, while the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has introduced a system allowing the filing of tax \\nreturns online, using an online tax calculator. The Government h as also launched “Shebakunjo” – a single \\naccess point that will provide about 400 services from 36 directories  \\nThe digitization of government services expanded and improved significantly. The government’s e -\\ngovernance initiative comprises 5 components i .e., Service Process Simplification  (SPS), ‘less paper \\noffice,’ government services portal, land information services, and government forms portal. The SPS  aims \\nto simplify processes involved in public service delivery and reduce the time required to deliver them.  The \\ngovernment has introduced e -filing mechanism at public offices to expedite the digitization process.  A total \\nof 424 public services were included in this programme till early 2020. ‘Seba Kunjo ’, a government services \\nportal initiated in 2014, to provide access to the major services has expanded significantly to include more \\nservices during the 7th Plan period. The government is committed to strengthening e -governance further by \\nincluding more services under SPS.  \\nE-Governance in Land Administration : The e -mutation that started in July 2019 all over the country \\nexcept three districts of hill tracts is a major step in restructuring the land sector; this will ensure more \\naccountability and transparency on the part of administration. Since  2019, 485 Upa zila land offices and \\ncircle offices and 3617 union land offices have been providing this service. Moreover, a total of \\n995,815  mutation requests were submitted online of whi ch 655,220 cases were resolved. The Government \\nis also presently undertaking Deed Registration Digitalization in 3 Districts and 5 sub -registry offices – \\nwhich is expected to reduce the mismanagement of documents and disputes over the ownership of land.  \\nAnti -Corruption Commission (ACC): During the 7FYP plan, the ACC has drawn up its ow n Five -Year \\nStrategic Action Plan in 2016. Furthermore, in consultation with all the stakeholders including the \\nintellectuals, politicians, bureaucrats, NGOs, businessmen and media representatives, the Commission \\nformulated a Specific, Measurable, Achievab le, Relevant and Time -bound (SMART) Strategy (2017 -2021) \\nthat will help the Commission to reduce corruption in a more systematic manner. Additionally, to improve \\nthe quality of the enquiry, investigation and prevention related activities, capacity building  measures were \\ntaken. In particular, the ACC officials were offered training both locally and internationally on forensic \\ninvestigation, case management and analysis, cybercrimes, money laundering, intelligence activities, ICT, \\netc. The Commission conducte d 5,183 enquiries cumulatively between 2016 and 2019 and filed 1,211 First \\nInformation Reports (FIR). In addition, in 2019 ACC received 1,47,524 phone calls through it’s hotline \\n106, of which 4,760 were scheduled allegations of ACC. Based on those allegati ons, 1,001 preventive \\ndrives were made  across the country . Between 2014 and 2020, ACC conducted 144 public hearing  all over \\nthe country . From those public hearing, ACC received 4,464 complaints, where 3,080 were resolved. The   \\n \\n169 \\n rate of success in public hear ing complaint management was nearly 69%. Other complaints remained \\nunresolved due to false information, out of ACC’s schedule and under trail at court. T he ACC officials \\nsometimes assess the causes of corruption, mismanagement and harassment in public serv ice delivery and \\nrecommend necessary preventive measures based on the discussion with different stakeholders, reviewing \\nintelligence data, available documents, media reports, etc.  \\nInformation Commission of Bangladesh: The Government of Bangladesh has shown  a steadfast \\ncommitment to the ideals of “right to information” and has accordingly invested in improving the capacity \\nof the Information Commission under the 7FYP. The Information Commission has seen a noticeable \\nincrease in the number of requests and com plaints it formally receives for public information between 2009 \\nand 2018, which highlights the steady increase in the confidence of the people in the Information \\nCommission . In fact, between 2009 and 2014, the number of complaints that were filed at the C ommission \\nwas 807. However, between 2015 and 2018, the total number of complaints has  increased to 2,137. The \\nCommission has also encouraged different public agencies to publish Annual Reports and provide all \\nessential information electronically through th eir respective websites. Additionally, the Information \\nCommission also started online tracking of RTI application on a test basis during the 7th plan period. \\nAnother major improvement was that the commission brought the private banks under the definition o f \\n“authority” against which the public can file for RTI.   \\nE-Procurement:  The Government has introduced online procurement systems to reduce corruption and \\nincrease competitiveness in government contracts, as it will enhance both more participation and \\ntransparency in the tender process guiding public procurement. The 7th plan aimed to expand e -GP during \\nits tenure and  by 2020 planned to bring all the public institutions under e -procurement. Accordingly, \\ngovernment took measures to scale up the adoption of e-GP by procuring agencies and procuring entities. \\nThe CPTU  data suggest that e -GP adoption increased at an exponential rate during the last few years. For \\ninstance, 458 organizations adopted e -GP till 2018. Currently, 55 percent of all procurement is cond ucted \\nunder the e -GP. It is also essential to mention that an  independent study based on 7100 procurement \\npackages of LGED, BWDB and the Roads and Highways Department showed that items procured under \\nthe e -GP system reduced the price -to-cost ratio by 12  percent compared to the traditional paper -based \\nprocurement system.  \\nTable 1.4: Trend of e -GP in Ministries, Divisions and Organizations  \\nFiscal \\nYears  Number of \\nMinistries  Growth \\nRate  Number of \\nDivisions  Growth Rate  Number of \\nOrganizations  Growth Rate  \\n2012  5  4  4  \\n2013  5 0.00 4 0.00 5 25.00  \\n2014  5 0.00 5 25.00  8 60.00  \\n2015  11 120.00  9 80.00  32 300.00  \\n2016  18 63.64  12 33.33  72 125.00  \\n2017  33 83.33  18 50.00  300 316.67  \\n2018  37 12.12  18 0.00 458 52.67  \\nSource: CPTU 2019    \\n \\n170 \\n Expanding UDCs:  The introduction and  expansion of union digital centres  (UDCs) was a major step \\ntowards extending the reach of e -governance in local government institutions (LGIs). UDCs reduced the \\ntime, cost and number of visits previously made by the service recipients. In particular, an a 2i estimate \\n(2017) shows that the delivery time for local service users decreased by 85%, cost by 63% and number of \\nvisits by 40% on average. The same report indicates that nearly $2 .0 billion has been saved owing to the \\nsimplification and digitization of the public services.  \\nGrievance Redress al System (GRS): To ensure accountability of the public administration, to improve \\nservice and to establish good governance, the government introduced Grievance Redress al System (GRS). \\nThe Government has taken numerous  measures to mainstream the application of GRS in most government \\nbodies, which allows citizens and officials greater access to voice their concern  and improve the state of \\ntransparency in public offices. These include the simplification of grievance submi ssion process and \\nappointment/designate the GRS and appellate officers in every public office.  \\nImproving Govern ance in Urban Local Government: The Government is presently implementing \\nnumerous projects to improve the state of governance in urban local gove rnment. Prominent among these \\nis the City Governance Project under the LGD, which aims to improve public services in six major city \\ncorporations in – Dhaka  North , Dhaka South, Chattogram , Rangpur, Comilla and Narayanganj. The \\nGovernment has also undertaken  a project for Capacity Development for City Corporation (C4C), which \\nhas the following objectives: (i) a medium to long -term strategy for improvements in governance  is \\ndeveloped ; (ii) a Plan -Do-Check -Action cycle of administrative improvement activities i n alignment with \\nthe strategy is established; (iii) an appropriate tax assessment and collection procedures are established, and \\ntax collection is conducted in a fair manner; (iv) a procedure of recurrent expenditure planning according \\nto revenue is establ ished. Furthermore, for improving urban management and facilitating governance \\nimprovements in Paurashavas, the Government has articulated the National Strategy for Paurashava \\nGovernance Improvement (2016 -2025).  The LGD has also adopted t wo essential stra tegy documents –Mid \\nand Long -Term Strategy for Upazila Parishad Governance Improvement and Strategy  for Governance \\nImprovement of City Corporations (SGICC) , 2020 -2030, which  will offer strategies and policy alterations \\nthat can help improve the governance p erformance in both rural and urban local government bodies.  \\nImproving the Effectiveness of Local Government and Rural Development: Under the 7FYP, the \\nGovernment prepared the “Local Government and Rural Development Sector Strategy Paper (LGRD \\nSSP)”, which  is a planning tool intended to help translate national goals and priorities outlined in the 7FYP \\ninto sector strategies and objectives. This planning tool is designed to complement and be consistent with \\nboth the 7FYP and other strategic and policy docume nts. In particular, LGRD SSP is designed to offer \\nbenefits in six main ar eas: (i) Project Identification – it offers a clear guidance to Ministries, Divisions, and \\nAgencies (MDAs) engaged in the identification of projects to ensure that projects are aligned  with sector \\ngoals and outcomes from the identification stage; (ii) Project Formulation – it provides a clear guidance to \\nMDAs engaged in the formulation of projects to ensure that projects deliver sector goals and outcomes \\nrequired to achieve 7FYP objectiv es; (iii) Project Appraisal –it provides a means by which both \\nMinistries/Divisions and Planning Commission (PC) Sector Divisions can assess project proposals against \\ntheir 7FYP relevance; and (iv) FYP Monitoring – by elaborating a Sector Results Framework ( SRF) that \\noffers the General Economics Division (GED) with more detailed information on sector -level performance \\nto complement the higher -level DRF; (v) FYP Financing –it offers information on the needs for resources \\nat the sector -levels that is valuable to  GED, Programming Division, and Finance Division; and (vi) Aid   \\n \\n171 \\n Coordination – it provides a clear overview of the current priorities within the Local Government and Rural \\nDevelopment (LGRD) sector to  the Development Partners (DPs) –under the tutelage of the  Economic \\nRelations Division (ERD).  \\nDepartment of Immigration and Passports (DIP): Under the 7FYP, the DIP has successfully offered \\nMachine  Readable Passports (MRP) to all new applicants and is following the guideline of the International \\nCivil Aviation O rganization (ICAO) to issue and extend the validity of Machine -Readable Visa (MRV). \\nDIP has also started issuing e -Passports to its citizens, making Bangladesh the first South Asian country \\nand 119th country in the world to issue such advanced travel docum ents. The DIP has also taken measures \\nto enhance the acceptability of Bangladesh passports and visas around the world and have simplified the \\nprocess of obtaining Bangladesh visas. Additionally, measures have been taken to simplify the process \\nassociated w ith the issuance of passports to Bangladeshi citizens, which will help accelerate the export of \\nlabour force to the overseas markets. This is expected to have a positive impact for the inflow of remittances \\nand reductions in poverty.  \\nResults -Based Monitori ng and Evaluation:  The Government of Bangladesh has remained committed to \\nstrengthen its Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as advocated by in the both Sixth and Seventh Plans. Mid -\\nTerm Reviews of all the plan documents are commissioned regularly to understan d the effectiveness  of the \\nmacro and sectoral policies that the Government has adopted. GED is vibrant in periodic result -based M&E \\nexercise at the macroeconomic level. It has performed end evaluation of 6FYP  and midterm implementation \\nreview of 7FYP  durin g the 7th plan period. The  Government has also widened its exercise of generating \\ndata by aiding the capacity of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), which helps document a large \\narray of socio -economic indicators and allows the examination of variou s policies in different sectors. \\nImplementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Ministry of Planning also continues \\nto focus on physical and financial aspects of project implementation.   \\n1.3 KEY CHALLENGES IN INSTITUIONS  \\nLaw making and Rule  of law: A consolidated legal framework is one of the most important conditions of \\nsustainable development. Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs division of Ministry of Law, Justice and \\nParliamentary Affairs is extending its intense assistance to the gove rnment to reach the goal. Still there are \\nsome challenges for achieving the desired goal. There is shortage of legislative officials to deliver the \\ndemanded quantity of drafting. For ensuring proper and perfect legislative draft, adequate and expert \\nlegisl ative officials are required. Therefore, expertise should be increased through providing national and \\ninternational training.  \\nMost of the people of Bangladesh are not aware about the legislation and constitutional provision. For \\nensuring legal and constitu tional rights of the people, awareness building is required. Before 1987, all laws \\nwere enacted in English and therefore all people of Bangladesh could not understand the meaning of law. \\nFor proper enforcement of law, people should be aware about the law. Therefore, all English laws should \\nbe translated in Bengali. In Bangladesh, there is also shortage of translation officer which should be \\nincreased.  \\n   \\n \\n172 \\n Justice and the Rule of Law:  The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh envisages a society \\nin which the rule of law, fundamental human rights, freedom, equality and justice will be secured for all its \\ncitizens. Moreover, all democratic polities recognize that the rule of law and an effective Judiciary create \\nthe fundamental foundations for human  well-being – along with offering markets a predictable and efficient \\nenvironment for performing productively. The Government of Bangladesh recognizes this and is committed \\nto improve both the state of the Judiciary by improving both the substantive nature  of the law and the neutral \\ntreatment of all its citizens, enhancing one’s access to it and ensuring timely disposals of judicial cases. The \\nGovernment of Bangladesh also takes Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) very seriously, \\nwhich makes it a mandate for all policymakers to improve the access to justice for all citizens and create \\neffective and inclusive accountable institutions at all levels. However, attaining timely disposals of cases \\nhas become a key concern within the Judiciary. In 20 10, the total back log of cases in both upper and lower \\nJudiciary was approximately 1.8 million, but it increased to approximate ly 3 million in 2014 and 3.3 to 3.8 \\nmillion cases by 2020. This undermines the timely disposal of both civil and criminal litiga tions. \\nAdditionally, current debates on developing an effective, accountable and an inclusive justice sector have \\nunderscored a large array of factors responsible for its under -performance – i.e. scarcity of necessary \\njudicial staffs (as reflected in Table : 1.5 and Figure1.1) to rules guiding recruitment and incentives for better \\nperformance to limited access to justice for the poor and marginalized communities. More specifically, in \\nterms of specific cross -country comparison on judges for every 1 million populations , Bangladesh has 11, \\nIndia has 19, Australia has 41, England has 51, Canada has 75 and the United States has 107.  This \\nunderscores the magnitude of human capital scarcity within the justice sector of Bangladesh. It is to be \\nnoted that appointmen t of the Ombudsman has not yet taken place , even though it was a stated objective of \\nthe 7th Plan. The objective of preparing and approving standardized criteria for the recruitment of Supreme \\nCourt judges was also not achieved.  \\nTable 1.5: Case Load agains t each Judge by types of Court  in 2018  \\nType of Court  No. of Cases  \\n1.

Bangladesh has a traditionally bee n a \\nprudent and effective manager of macroeconomic stability – and the Government has demonstrated \\neffective management skills in maintaining inflation, import coverage of foreign reserve and international \\ndebt obligation. Moreover, maintaining sound macro economic stability is critical as it helps countries avoid \\nwhat is popularly known as the “middle income trap” previously experienced by countries like Argentina \\nand other Latin American countries.   Governmen t needs to seriously address the existing challe nges related \\nwith governance in the banking sector. To protect the interest of depositors and to ensure safety of the \\nbanking sector Bangladesh Bank (BB) instructed all commercial banks to have strong and healthy corporate \\ngovernance so that any fraudulent  activities can strictly be monitored. Besides, BB has introduced \\nsubstantial changes in bank supervision techniques and approaches in recent years. In light of global \\nexperiences, BB is emphasizing strengthening capital adequacy structure of the banks, re -fixation of reserve \\nstructure, strengthening risk management system and information technology in banks are being upgraded \\nto enable rapid online accessing of data from banks.    \\nOn the other hand, there is an urgent need for measures that reduce N PLs in the banking sector, especially \\nin the State -Owned Commercial Banks. The NPL s as a percent of total loan were stable (9 per cent) from \\n2015 to June, 2020 except 20 18. NPLs (% of total loan) of S CBs after reaching peak at 30 have been \\ndecreasing since 2018. H owever , issuance of rules, such as increasing the number of family members in a \\nbank’s board of directors, and significant recent relaxation of provisions for rescheduling of defaulting \\nborrowers have weakened the regulatory environment.  \\nMoreover, Banglad esh maintains on e of the lowest Tax -GDP ratios  in the world, which underscores the \\nneed to improve its tax framework to mitigate both tax avoidance and tax evasion by the economic agents. \\nThe NBR took few measures to broaden the revenue base and enhance  revenue collection. As an incentive, \\nthe government kept income tax rate and company tax rate unchanged. However, while tax revenues \\nincreased throughout the Plan period, it had little impact on a stagnant Tax-GDP ratio. As a result, the Plan \\ntargets on the Tax-GDP ratio were unmet, and due to the present Covid -19 pandemic – it is unlikely that \\nthe 7th Plan’s tax -GDP ratio will increase in FY20.  \\nTable 1.6: Trend in Non -Performing Loans as a Percent of Total Loans during 2011 -2020  \\nBank type  Non-performing loa n as % of total loan amount   \\n2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  \\nSCBs  11 24 20 22 22 25 27 30 24 23 \\nDFIs  25 27 27 33 23 26 23 19 15 16 \\nPCBs  3 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 \\nFCBs  3 4 6 7 8 10 7 6 6 5 \\nTotal  6 10 9 10 9 9 9 10 9 9 \\nSource: Banking  Regulation and Policy Department (BRPD), Bangladesh Bank  \\nState of Decentralization:  Despite being a country of about 170 million people, Bangladesh administration \\nand economic management remains heavily centralized. The national government undertakes more than  \\n90% of all public expenditures and mobilizes 98% of all resources, which is indicative of extreme fiscal \\ncentralization.  Additionally, the initiatives of the local governments are excessively dependent on support \\nfrom the LGD . Having lack of strong initia tive as well as capacity of local resource mobilization, LGIs are   \\n \\n174 \\n unable to deliver required services to the citizens.   Decentralization issues are discussed in detail in Chapter \\n7, Part 2 of the Plan Document.  \\n1.4 8FYP STRATEGY FOR IMPROVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE A ND INSTITUTIONS  \\n1.4.1  Key Area 1: Public Sector Capacity: Improving Administrative Capacity  \\nThere is a unanimous agreement in the development literature that long -run economic progress is only \\npossible when nations are able to create and sustain effective  states that can mobilize resources to invest in \\nphysical and human capital, enforce contracts and ensure public order. The Government is committed to \\ndemocratic governance, which has motivated the public administration to harness more transparency, \\npartic ipation and accountability within its operations. Consequently, improving the Government’s \\nadministrative capacity is fundamental for enhancing its effectiveness.  The following measures will be \\nprioritized for implementation under the 8FYP:  \\n\\uf0b7 Participation,  Accountability and Transparency in Decision -making:  The Government will \\nensure greater participation throughout the administrative process to ensure that its policies are \\nformulated and implemented after completing a consultative process with all the stak eholders to \\nenable better outcomes. This will also ensure better transparency and accountability within the \\nadministrative process.    \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing a Shared Vision for the Public Administration:  The government will ensure that \\nVision 2041 and the associated  PP2041 must be embraced by different organs of the state and \\ngovernment employees must understand and recognize their exact role in ensuring this vision is \\npursued with upmost rigour and diligence. This necessitates that each organ of the state operates \\nunder a clear framework with well specified organizational goals and targets. Moreover, \\ngovernment officials will be motivated to take ownership of this shared vision by developing sense \\nof membership of the organization  \\n\\uf0b7 Offering Adequate Training: To devel op an effective public administration, the policymakers \\nwill ensure that poorly qualified or insufficiently experienced personnel are not promoted within \\nthe Administration. Moreover, to mitigate this problem, the Government is committed to offer the \\ncivil servants specialised training to general educational and management skills. More specifically, \\nthe Government will ensure that: (i) the right set of training that addresses the deficit of skills in \\nthe public sector is provided to the employees; and (ii) the right candidates are chosen for the \\ntraining. The Government will further ensure that every official should get a minimum number of \\nhours/days of the right set of training, which will be included in the Annual Performance \\nAgreement of the Government Of fices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase the Effectiveness of the Public Service Commission (PSC):  The Government will \\ncontinue promoting the merit -based competent bureaucratic apparatus to effectively function as a \\nmodern state where the government employees are not only capable enough to perform their \\nresponsibilities efficiently, but can also improve the system of governance by becoming agents of \\npositive change through undertaking innovation and reforms. It will also undertake measures to \\noffer itself more financial autonomy fo r the PSC, so that it can undertake initiatives on its own to \\nstrengthen its operations and efficiency.    \\n \\n175 \\n Annual Performance Agreement (APA):  The Government has remained committed to the \\nimplementation of the APA under the 7FYP and it has taken a wide range of measures to make the APA an \\neffective institutional arrangement. The key objective here is to enhance the state of accountability in line \\nMinistries and make them more accountable to the Cabinet. In particular, the APA allows a systematic \\nprocess for ma naging and monitoring the activities and work environments of public sector organizations. \\nConsequently, under the 8FYP, the Government will remain committed to strengthening this appraisal \\nsystem further and improve its methodology. No punitive measure or  reward was built into the original \\ndesign and the system only functioned as a mechanism for naming and shaming. However, under the 8FYP, \\nit will be under consideration to see if some degree of tangible incentives is attached to the assessments of \\nthe APA,  so that the line Ministries are further incentivized to deliver the targets that are agreed upon . \\nOnline APA management system will be further focused and  improved during the 8th plan period. Cabinet \\nDivision is planning to implement five major activities  to fulfil the desired commitment through \\nstrengthening the implementation of APA. These are i) formulation of a policy/strategy on government \\nperformance management including incentive mechanisms, ii) extension of APA to all public sector \\norganizations , iii) linking employee performance with APA to synchronize organizational vision and \\nobjective with employee work plan, iv) updating online Annual Performance Agreement Management \\nSystem (APAMS) for the improvement of preparation, monitoring, reporting and e valuation of the APA of \\npublic sector organizations and v) enhancement of the capacity of the implementing agencies.  \\nGrievance Redressal  System (GRS):  Under the 8FYP, the Government will improve the functioning of \\nthe central Grievance Redressal  System (G RS). The system has, until now, allowed the citizens to benefit \\nfrom the availability of an institutional scope to systematically express their concerns or grievances with \\nthe public bodies, so that genuine concerns about them are addressed through a non -threatening, supporting \\nmechanism.  Thus, further mainstreaming of such institutional scopes for registering public grievance will \\nallow the public bodies to serve the people better . \\n1.4.2  Key Area 2 a: Justice and the Rule of Law  \\nThere is an increasing rec ognition within the Government that effectiveness of the formal judicial \\ninstitution, semi -formal judicial institution and access to justice is crucial  for improving the state of rule of \\nlaw in Bangladesh. Even under the SDGs, formulated by the United Nati ons for all countries , an agenda to \\nachieve “access to justice for all” has seen a prominent presence. It is also widely believed among social \\nscientists that long -term development prospect of nations critically depends on the rule of law and their \\ncapacit y to protect property rights and individual rights within their polities. This, nonetheless, necessitates \\nthat the policymakers invest resources to make judicial services accessible, affordable and acceptable. Thus, \\nto improve the state of the rule of law in Bangladesh, the following activities are prioritized under the 8FYP:  \\nFormal Judicial Institutions  \\n1. Bangladesh presently has one of the lowest judge -to-people ratios in the world, which has contributed \\nto the huge backlog of cases and the low rates of the ir disposal. In fact, latest estimates indicate that \\nBangladesh has approximately 1.1 judges  for every 100,000 people, which is far below the South -East \\nand South Asian average of between 2 and 2.5 judges per 100,000 people. Consequently, the \\nGovernment un der the 8FYP, will continue expedit ing the recruitment to the Judiciary to increase the \\njudge -to-people ratio.    \\n \\n176 \\n 2. Existing empirical examinations have revealed that a handful of administrative Districts work as \\n“pipeline” through which case backlogs cumulativ ely increases over time. Additional measures will be \\nundertaken for such “pipe -line” districts to ensure that Districts Courts in such administrative Districts \\nhave the necessary resources to dispose cases efficiently in a time -bound manner.  \\n \\n3. Strategic Pla n of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh 2017 -2022 was adopted under the 7FYP period – \\nand it identifies in details specific goals, strategies and activities that need to be pursued and undertaken \\nin order to strengthen the effectiveness of the formal judiciar y. Against that context, the Government \\nunder the 8FYP will remain committed to all the goals, strategies and activities that were formulated \\nby the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, which remain incomplete or unrealized.  \\n \\n4. Reducing pressure on the district lev el courts and institutions by filtering out simple, minor or vexatious \\ncases, while better equipping the actors in the judicial process to manage the serious and complex ones \\nin need of legal representat ion and adjudication.   \\n \\n5. Increasing the capacity of lo cal justice services to resolve disputes at low cost, fairly and quickly – so \\nproducing better outcomes for people.  \\n \\n6. In relation to the excessive backlog of cases on court records, the Government will take a two -pronged \\napproach based upon the findings of  the Justice Audit. It will review all pending cases, and institute \\nrigorous and consistent filtering of new cases. Continuing the on-going  work of the Supreme Court \\nBacklog of Pending Cases Monitoring Committees, cases pending for more than 5 years and 10  years \\nwill be reviewed with the aim of closing or dismissing them and thus pruning the cases which are \\npending to those which are still ‘live’. It will also explore supplementary screening activities to assess \\nwhether other pending cases are indeed pendin g or may have been unofficially settled along the way, \\nwith a view to closing these.  \\n \\n7. The Case Coordination Committees (CCC) will play a pivotal role in filtering cases to the more \\nappropriate venue, as well as clearing the backlog of cases. During Eighth  Plan an Inter -Ministerial \\ncoordination mechanism will be established to complete the policy -evidence feedback loop from \\ndistrict (CCCs) to national level.  \\n \\n8. The Government will invest in better understanding the barriers to justice for women and children.  The \\ngrowth of pending cases in the Nari O Shishu courts will be reduced rapidly. A root and branch study \\nof the workings of the Nari O Shishu courts will be conducted so that services can be adjusted \\naccordingly.  \\n \\nSemi -Formal and Informal Justice Institut ions \\nNearly 70-80% people in developing countries use semi -formal or informal judicial institutions to find \\nredress al for civil disputes or quasi -criminal litigations2. Thus, developing an effective semi -formal or \\ninformal justice sector institution  is fun damental for improving the state of rule of law in a country. \\nConsequently, to improve the effectiveness of the informal justice sector, the following activities will be \\nundertaken under the 8FYP:  \\n                                                     \\n2  See: UNDP, (2006). Doing Justice:  How informal justice systems can contribute  Oslo Governance Centre    \\n \\n177 \\n 1. The Government will increase the capacities of the Union Pa rishads (UP) that operate as a key \\ninstitutional arrangement guiding arbitration among people within their communities.  \\n2. The Government will scale up village courts and ensure their 100% coverage of all Unions under the \\n8FYP . This will also require greater mobilization of resources in order to enhance their capacities.  \\n3. The Government will design the village  courts further so that there is limited duplication of judicial \\nservices between the village court and union parishads.  \\n4. The Government will encourage the  local agencies to increase the awareness amongst citizens in rural \\ncommunities for them to use the village court mechanism to resolve disputes without resorting to formal \\njudicial institutions, so that the problem of case backlogs in the formal Judiciary is reduced over time.  \\nAccess to Justice  \\n1. To improve the access to justice, the Government will offer legal aid to approximately 200,000 victims \\nannually by 2025.  \\n2. The Government will invest in the National Legal Aid Services Organization’s (NLASO) capacity so \\nthat it can effectively reach the poor and marginalized communities, and improve their access to legal \\nredressal . The NLASO was established in 2000, and started to operate in fully since 2009 in all 64 \\ndistricts of Bangladesh aiming to provide legal ass istance to the poor and marginalized groups. At \\npresent, sixty -four District Legal Aid Offices, Supreme Court Legal Aid Office, two Labour  Court \\nLegal Aid Cells and the National Helpline Call Centre  are working to ensure government legal aid \\nservices under  NLASO. However, capacity constraint still remains a major problem in the NLASOs. \\nEven though the plan committed to recruit legal aid officers in all 64 districts, a 2017 report states that \\n41 out of 64 districts do not have legal aid officers.  \\n3. The NLASO will also formulate greater partnerships with the NGOs and other non -state actors to \\nfacilitate the access to justice. This will help greater synchronization of efforts and will assist an \\nefficient delivery of quality legal aid.  \\n4. The NLASO will commission d iagnostic assessments so that better instruments are designed to deliver \\nlegal aid. It will also assess and document the proportion of the vulnerable population who qualify for \\nlegal aid, and their key profiles in order to understand the combination of fac tors that shape who has \\naccess to justice and when.   \\n5. The Government will institutionalize Para-legalism as an instrument to complement  the objectives of \\nthe NLASO. The use of paralegals has mitigated problem of case -backlogs and under -trial prisoners, \\nand is associated with numerous positive outcomes. In effect, paralegals are not only addressing the \\nproblem of ‘asymmetric information’ that undermines the scope of the poor or women from availing \\nnecessary legal redressal , but they also facilitate jail visi ts by the District Judges and Deputy \\nCommissioners  (DC)/District Magistrates (DM) –as they help them to observe and recognize the real \\nsituation of the prisons. Paralegals are also encouraging the Police to submit reports within time, \\nespecially for petty c rimes, as they reduce the amount of time prisoners have to stay in prison awaiting \\nthose Police reports. As a result, courts are becoming more ‘proactive’ in administering such cases.    \\n \\n178 \\n 1.4.3 Key Area 2b: Law Making and the Rule of Law  \\nThe government of Ba ngladesh is not only engaged in making proper legislation, but is desired in making \\nthe process fruitful and accommodative. For that purpose the following activities will be undertaken during \\nthe 8FYP  to improve the existing law making process: (i) local a nd overseas training of legislative officials \\nand various diploma and higher studies courses relating to legislative drafting for preparing skilled \\nmanpower in conformity with international standard, (ii) set up of legislative research cell and legislative  \\nediting unit, (iii) translation of all act from English to Bengali and vice versa on the basis of priority and \\nimportance, (iv) set up of legislative library with electronic cataloguing  system, an archive and record room \\nfor conservation and preservation of historical and important documents in the field of law, (v) set up of \\nlaw public awareness  cell and resource  documentation centre, and (vi) codification and update of \\nsubordinate legislation.  \\nAdvanced Steps to Keep Forward Judicial Sector  under the 8th Plan  \\nE-Judiciary:  The Government of Bangladesh recognizes an imminent need for digitization of judiciary. \\nThis digitization will cover all the necessary equipment for the judges and court staff, hardware and \\nconnectivity support and relevant software su pport. So, three folds mixing and collaboration is needed \\namong Supreme Court as of domain institution. Law and Justice Division has planned  to undertake a \\ndevelopment project valuing Tk. 2690 crore to  develop ICT infrastructure, supply hardware and instal l \\nconnectivity  with the help of Bangladesh  Computer Council . In every district there will be a Programmer \\nand some Assistant Programmers, Maintenance Engineer and other supporting staffs to look after the digital \\nactivities of the Judiciary at field level.  \\nEstablishment of Independent Prosecution Services:  Government plans to institute a permanent attorney \\nservice to provide adeq uate, prompt and expert service . In principle, it is decided that with a guided and \\ndue process Bangladesh Judicial Service Commis sion will recommend appointment of the Addl. AG, DA Gs \\nand AAGs. Government will gradually execute this decision.  Primarily 70% of th is attorney service  \\nappointment will be from registered advocates which will be selected by Government. Rest 30% will be \\nrecommended by Judicial Service Commission to appoint. Before, adhering  to the appointing process, it \\nwill develop attorney service appointing rule, disciplinary rule, service rule, posting and promotion \\nguidelines, in service training procedures etc.  \\nEstabl ishment of a Judicial Academy: The Government of  Bangladesh plans to achieve an ambitious \\ntarget within 2041 in all aspects of a developed country. Respecting that target Judicial Sector will also play \\na role. To hold the judicial sector in a high position  comparing to developed country necessity of \\nestablish ing a Judicial Academy is crucial . Judicial Academy will conduct research and studies in the areas \\nof interest , develop  standard curriculum, design  planning  and standard  training, maintain international  \\ncollaboration and deal other issues for both subordinate and higher judiciaries . The academy  may be located \\nnearby Dhaka and it will  require  about 35 acres of land to construct physical infrastructures and provide \\nallied facilities.       \\nProfessional Dev elopment of the Judges of Sub -Ordinate Judiciary:  The Government of Bangladesh \\nacknowledges that Judges need continuous in -service training. In particular, judicial staffs need to acquire \\ninternational standard orientation through state of the art training s on issues such as cybercrime, online   \\n \\n179 \\n security, transnational terrorism, ICT use in judicial activities, digital court management, environmental \\njustice, juvenile justice, domestic violence, offshore crime and dispute regarding offshore activities, law of  \\nthe sea, climate change law and policy, energy law and policy, judicial sector planning  for sustainable \\ndevelopment, judicial sector project & programme monitoring, coastal zone management and planning, \\nfisheries resources management, maritime security, environmental planning, governance and justice, \\nenvironmental court system and trans boundary  marine spatial planning system etc. Gov ernment will \\nundertake specialis ed projects and activities to train Judges on all such dime nsions - and will form \\nspecialis ed groups to address  the key issues that carry  key economic importance.  \\n1.4.4 Key Area 3: Improving Economic Governance  \\nEconomic governance involves the processes that support economic activity and economic transactions by \\nprotecting property rights, enf orcing contracts, and taking collective action to provide appropriate physical \\nand organizational infrastructure and adequate human capital. This necessitates that institutions ensure the \\nenforcement of contracts; protection of property rights and practice  the rules and regulations required to \\nfacilitate successful interactions among the economic agents. Moreover, it is widely believed and \\nempirically demonstrated that the countries that can harness public institutions which offer better economic \\ngovernance  have higher scopes to sustain long -run development. Consequently, the Government aims to \\nundertake the following activities to improve state of economic governance in some key areas under the 8FYP.     \\nImproving Effectiveness and Accountability of the Bank ing Sector  \\nImprove Supervision of the Banking Sector: Under the 8FYP, the Government will sufficiently empower \\nthe Bangladesh Bank to effectively perform its responsibilities. As a result, the Government will facilitate \\nincreased recruitment of quality sta ffs, offer the resources to procure the technology required to strengthen \\nits effectiveness, and implement prudential norms. The Government acknowledges that an effective \\nautonomous Central Bank is necessary to conduct sound monetary policy management and to exercise \\nutmost prudence in matters such as the licensing of new banks, bank consolidation, bank supervision and \\nloan recoveries.  \\nThe positive experience with better supervision of banks leading to the adoption of Basel I and II is a \\nreflection of the importance of continuously improving high -quality supervision. However, the \\ndeterioration in the portfolio quality of the State -Owned Commercial Banks is limiting  the soundness of \\nthe banking sector. Consequently, under the 8FYP, the Government will take n ecessary measures to \\nimprove the performance of the banking sector. The entire banking sector (SCBs, PCBs, FCBs and NBFIs) will \\nbe brought under a single regulator, i.e., the Bangladesh Bank. The government will enable BB to act quickly \\nto reduce NPLs in t he banking sector and ensure that capital adequacy ratios comply with Basel III requirements.  \\nSpecial Measures for Monitoring NBFIs:  Under the 8th Plan, the Government will take measures  for \\nproper  monitoring and supervision of the non -bank financial insti tutions (NBFIs) and Bangladesh Bank \\nwill be advised and supported to classifying them into categories, such as those that are performing well, \\nthose that may be salvaged through stringent central bank supervision and liquidity support.  \\n   \\n \\n180 \\n Improving Loan Rec overy and Effectiveness of Banking Courts: Attaining decisions from the court \\nsystem on outstanding loans is a time -consuming process, which discourages the financial institutions from \\nseeking this remedy. To mitigate this constraint, the Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003 (Money Loan Court Act, \\n2003) was enacted in March 2003 with a view to streamline the process of realization of overdue loans and \\nadvances by the banks and financial institutions.  Provisions have been made in this Act for realization of \\nthe banks’  dues by selling properties held in security, without prior orders of the court. This is an \\nencouraging step; however, its effectiveness has remained questionable due to the tremendous challenges \\nof implementation. Against this context, the Government will  improve the effectiveness of the ‘Artha Rin \\nAdalat ’ under the 8FYP  to make loan recovery attain the desired benchmark. Moreover, steps will be taken \\nto implement Artha Rin Adalat Ain 2003 along with other related acts effectively so that the defaulters ge t \\nno loopholes to avoid and delay loan repayment.  \\nProper Management of the Interest Rate Policy: Under the 8FYP, the government will assist the \\nBangladesh Bank to prudently manage its interest rate policy in order to strengthen financial intermediation \\nwhile also keeping interest rate low to promote economic activities. Instability or weakness in the \\nmanagement of interest rates can hinder a stable momentum of growth and weaken the banking sector by \\nreducing the rate of growth of bank deposits. A slow -grow ing deposit base in the face of rising NPLs could \\ncreate serious liquidity and profitability problems for the banks, possibly leading to financial \\ndisintermediation.  The positive real interest rate for deposit mobilization can be reconciled with low real \\ninterest rate for lending by lowering NPL and improving bank competition . \\nStringent Criteria for Re -Capitalization of Public Banks:  Budget transfers (recapitalization) to under -\\nperforming state -owned banks will be linked to stringent performance criteria w hich require the recipient \\nbanks to reform their operations and become sustainably solvent, failing which required to  be penalized as \\na first step. If non-performance  continues beyond and agreed time frame, deeper reform measures to reduce \\nthe size of thei r operations, foreign management contracts, mergers, etc. will be considered. Information on \\ncapital injections to individual banks along with the reform program agreed between the government and \\nthe banks will be placed in the public domain on a full disc losure basis to justify the use of public funds.    \\nImproving Public Financial Management  \\nImproving Tax -GDP Ratio:  Effective functioning of the Government is contingent on the institutions that \\nsupport markets. This, nonetheless, depends on the effectiven ess of the institutions of taxation. It is well \\nrecognized that weak tax collection is a manifestation of weak state capacity and it undermines a \\ngovernment’s possibility to mobilize resources for investing in human and physical capital and provide \\npublic order, which hinders the long -run growth of nations. As a result, the Government of Bangladesh has \\nundertaken numerous measures to broaden the tax base in Bangladesh. The National Board of Revenue \\n(NBR) also organizes regular events to enrol new taxpayers and encourage the existing taxpayers to pay \\ntheir due share accordingly. Given that Bangladesh has among the lowest Tax -GDP ratios in the world, the \\ngovernm ent aims to increase its Tax GDP ratio under the 8FYP. Consequently, the Government will \\nprioritize f iscal reforms and adequate investments in the NBR  capacity.  Details of the tax reforms are \\ncontained in Chapter 5, Part 1 of th is document.  \\n   \\n \\n181 \\n Improvements in Planning and Budgeting: Considerable progress was made in strengthening the \\nplanning and budgeting  process during the 6FYP and the 7FYP. The medium -term fiscal framework is now \\nintroduced in all line ministries. The budget accounts are all integrated through the computerized ibas++ \\nprocess that allows timely release of funds and expense accounting usin g a standard accounting framework. \\nHowever, the budget process is still on a yea rly cycle and expenses do not carry over to the next fiscal year \\ncausing an end -year spending bulge. Importantly, the link between development budget and revenue budget \\nis stil l weak.  Efforts will be made to address these issues in the 8FYP.  More integration and synchronis ation \\nof National Plans and Annual Budget s need  to be ensured.  \\n \\nImproved Public Financial Management (PFM): A series of financial management reforms in public  \\nspending at the national level based on multi -donor technical assistance has improved the accountability \\nfor public spending. Nevertheless, major gaps remained. The 2016 Public Expenditure Financial \\nAssessment Report (PEFA) provided a mixed performance ra ting on PFM management for Bangladesh. \\nSome 31 PEFA indicators were rated on a grading scale of A -D, with A as highly satisfactory. In between, \\ngrades are also rated as a plus, which brings the performance closer to the next higher grade (e.g. a C+ is \\ncloser to B).  The distribution of ratings is shown in Figure 1.2.  \\nFigure 1.2: Distribution of PEFA Ratings 2015  \\n \\n           Source: 2016 PEFA Report.  \\nThe areas that require most attention (a grade of C or below) include: expenditure composition outturn \\n(D+);  revenue outturn (C);  budget classification (C); government off -budget operations (D); transfers to \\nsub-national governments (D+); performance information for service delivery (D+); public access to fiscal \\ninformation (D), fiscal risk reporting (D+); p ublic investment management (C); public asset management \\n(D+); macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting (D+); revenue administration (D+); expenditure arrears (D); \\ninternal controls on non -salary expenditures (C); internal audit (D); annual financial reports ( D+); and \\nexternal audits (D+).  \\n \\nEfforts were made in the 7FYP to address these concerns by developing an Action Plan that was endorsed \\nby the Ministry of Finance. However, implementation has been limited owing to a number of factors \\nincluding the delay in  technical assistance for the next round of reforms. The 8FYP will make a strong \\neffort to implement the agreed program of actions with a time bound  implementation plan.   026\\n19\\n1329\\n13\\n05101520253035\\nA B C+ C D+ DPercent  \\n \\n182 \\n Increased Commitment to Transparency and Participation in the Budgetary Process:  To enhance \\ntransparency in the budget preparation process, the Government will make the pre -budget statement \\navailable in the public domain. This will be done to improve the level of transparency and participation of \\nkey stakeholders. The progress in this spe cific dimension will be tracked through Bangladesh’s overall \\nperformance in the Open Budget Index –produced by the Open Budget Survey, which uses over 100 \\nindicators to assess whether the government puts eight important budget documents in the public domain  \\nin manner that is both useful and comprehensive . The government will also make available all fiscal data \\nshowing actual outcomes for both expenditure and revenues.  \\n \\nIntroducing Multi -Year Public Investment Programme (MY PIP): Building on the progresses and  \\nachievements in the 7FYP , the government is committed to accelerating the PIM reform in the 8FYP . The \\nPlanning Commission will continue taking the lead in the PIM reform in the 8FYP . It will plan and implement \\nthe PIM reform under the larger umbrella of t he PFM Reform Strategy 2016 -2021 and the PFM Action Plan \\n2018 -2023. They will ensure full participation of all PIM stakeholders in the PIM reform process.  \\n \\nThe focus areas of the PIM reform in 8 FYP include the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve project formulation, apprai sal, and approval processes . In the 8FYP period, Ministry \\nAssessment Format (MAF) and Sector Appraisal Format (SAF) will be introduced and used in the \\nassessment and appraisal process of all DPPs in two pilot sectors – (i) power and energy, and (ii) local \\ngovernment and rural development.  After successful introduction in the two pilot sectors, MAF and \\nSAF will be rolled out to all other sectors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen strategic linkages between ADP, FYP and MTBF .  In the 8FYP period, Sector Strategy \\nPapers (SSPs) and Multi -Year Public Investment Programme (MYPIP) will be introduced and used in \\nthe MTBF, ADP, and Revised ADP (RADP) processes in the two pilot sectors, then rolled out to all \\nother sectors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Align sector classification of ADP/RADP with FYP and MTBF processe s. Current sector \\nclassification of ADP/RADP is based on 17 sectors, and this does not match with 14 sectors of FYP \\nand MTBF. The Programming Division has taken the initiative to prepare ADP/RADP based on the 14 \\nsectors of FYP and MTBF to contribute to str engthening the linkages among FYP, ADP/RADP and \\nMTBF processes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Operationalize the database management system of ADP .  In the 8FYP, the new database management \\nsystem for ADP will be made fully operational, including modules of MYPIP, for all government \\nentities. In this process, digital interface of the ADP database management system will be also \\nestablished with that of FD in the preparation process of national budget.  \\n \\nImproving the Effectiveness and Accountability of the Capital Market  \\nThe capital marke t of Bangladesh has not yet played a substantial role in financial intermediation and \\nmobilization of resources in the economy, in spite of the ever -growing large financing needs of the economy. \\nThere are three major constraints hindering the performance o f the capital market: asymmetry of information \\nand lack of trust in the market; preference of the citizens towards investing more in banking sector more than \\nthe capital market, and weakness of monitoring and surveillance. In particular, the following acti vities will \\nbe undertaken under the 8FYP  to ensure greater capacity and effectiveness of the capital market:    \\n \\n183 \\n \\uf0b7 Government will undertake a long -term capacity building of Bangladesh Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (BSEC) in areas of skilled human capital, modern technologies and prudential regulations. \\nA new organizational structure of BSEC is in -progress. The Commission is also redefining securities \\nlaws and regulations in order to ensure prudential regulations and supervision of issuers and market \\ninterme diaries in the capital market.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Bangladesh will build a vibrant, dynamic and good -governed primary market. Acts and regulations \\nconcerning public issue of debt and equity securities will be redefined so that securities are fair ly valued \\nand the interest o f investors is protected. In this process, the role of auditor and rating agencies is \\ncritical. Their regulations and enforcement will require speedy  reforms.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A technology platform of extensible business reporting language (XBRL) shall prove critical to this \\nend of transparency and accountability for stock exchanges, issuers and other market intermediaries. \\nBSEC will invest heavily to enforce observance of issuers and market intermediaries with International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), Internat ional Standards of Auditing (ISAs) and modern \\ncorporate governance codes.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Government is committed to building a diversified capital market involving both bond and derivative \\nmarkets so that financing of business moves from banking system to the capital m arket. A well -functioning \\nderivative market is indispensable for prudential risk management for the investors. The Commission shall \\nclosely work with stock exchanges for this important capacity building.    \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Continuous coordination is needed between key reg ulators including Bangladesh Securities and \\nExchange Commission, Bangladesh Bank and National Board of Revenue (NBR) for a well-governed \\ncapital market. The Government will evaluate the need of an institutional mechanism to facilitate this \\ncoordination bet ween Bangladesh Bank and BSEC for building a modern capital market. It will also \\ncreate a task force to detect conflicts of interest within the regulatory bodies and financial institutions, \\nespecially amongst those who have an exposure to the stock market.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will improve the surveillance software/systems to prevent manipulation of the \\ntransaction of securities in the stock market and to ensure greater transparency. To this end, BSEC will \\nguide stock exchanges in upgrading their trading platfor ms, order management system (OMS) and a \\ndynamic real -time trade settlement infrastructure.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Inquiry, supervision and enforcement of securities laws will comprise a critical capacity building for \\nBSEC and stock exchanges. The new organogram of BSEC has mad e provisions for new human capital \\nand other resources to deliver these core functions. Securities laws are also continuously evolving to \\nmake a big difference to this end. The Government will take measures to ensure that companies comply \\nwith the financia l reporting and disclosure rules of the BSEC. Strict accountability will be enforced in \\ncases where companies fail to comply with the financial disclosure rules. This may require penal \\nmeasures. More stock market related legal cases need to  be transferred to the special tribunal on capital \\nmarket for quick disposal of the cases.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Tax laws are undeniably important for capital market. The Government will improve the tax incentives \\nfurther for the private sector companies to be listed with stock exchanges and to commit to enhanced \\ntransparency and accountability. An option to go for listing shall be made attractive for an issuer of \\ncapital and tax policies will be geared to this end. The Government is committed for a transition from \\nthe current bank -based borro wing to capital market -based financing.    \\n \\n184 \\n  \\n\\uf0b7 During the 7th plan period the government formed the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to upgrade \\nthe accounting and auditing standards of the capital market to international levels. It is also mandated \\nto play a ke y coordinating role between BSEC, NBR and the Bangladesh Bank to improve regulation \\nof the capital. The Government will make FRC to be further operational and effective for enforcing \\naccounting and auditing standards. On the other hand, the special tribuna l on capital market was \\ndormant for the last 18 months due to not receiving any stock -market -related cases. Under the 8th Plan, \\nthe Government is committed to upgrading the accounting and auditing standards of the capital market.  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial literacy is very  low in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Academy of Securities Market (BASM) and \\nBangladesh Institute of Capital Market (BICM) are two institutes of the Government to enhance \\nfinancial literacy in Bangladesh. The Gove rnment is committed to invest  in both the institu tes and \\nmaking them effective for financial literacy.   \\n1.4.5 Key Area 4: Improving Governance in Local Government  \\nImproved governance in the activities of local governments allows  countries to benefit from the rewards of \\ndecentralization. This allows effec tive policy formulation and execution as both local and national organs \\nof the State coordinates to decide what policy is needed and how they can be best executed. The \\nGovernment of Bangladesh recognizes the need of improved governance in the local governm ent \\nadministration to take  up the decentralization agenda, and intends to undertake a wide array of initiatives \\nunder the 8FYP. The detailed local government institution (LGI) reforms are discussed in Chapter 7, Part \\n2. The main objective of these reforms is to strengthen the capacity of LGIs to delivery better services to \\ntheir constituencies through greater administrative and financial autonomy including higher and more \\npredictable resources. The aim is to take the first step to move towards establishing a system of LGIs as \\nfound in current UMICs.  \\n1.4.6 Other Areas of Activities under the 8th Plan  \\n\\uf0a7 Strengthening the Election Commission (EC): The Government recognizes that without an \\nindependent and effective Election Commission (EC), democratic franchise c annot be extended to the \\ncitizens. Consequently, under the 8FYP , the following activities will be pursued to enhance the \\nperformance of the EC: (i) The Government will offer all necessary support to EC to expand the use \\nof electronic voting machines to imp rove transparency in the electoral process; (ii) EC will e xecute its \\noperations independently and effectively; and (iii) More measures will be taken to improve EC’s \\ncapacity to monitor election expenditure by candidates and control campaign contribution du ring local \\nand national elections .  \\n\\uf0a7 Making Parliamentary Process Effective: The Government of Bangladesh is not only committed to \\nthe ideals of democratic governance, but is interested in making the process transparent, accountable \\nand participatory. To th at end, the following activities will be undertaken during the 8th Plan to improve \\nthe role of the Parliament as a reservoir of people’s trust and aspirations: (i) The Government will \\nremain committed to increasing the number of hearings open to the public , particularly of important \\nbudgetary committees such as the Public Accounts Committee; (ii) Efforts will be undertaken to \\nreduce the time that is lost due to lack of quorum; (iii) The Government will remain committed to    \\n \\n185 \\n improvements in the functioning of  Public Accounts Committee; (iv) The Govt. will try to ensure that \\npercentage of seats held by women in the national parliament is at least 33% by 2025.  \\n\\uf0a7 Appointment of Ombudsman:  The government will e nsure the appointment of an Ombudsman \\nwhich was committe d under the 7th Plan.  \\n\\uf0a7 Addressing Corruption:  Addressing corruption will receive top priority from the governmen t in \\norder to eliminate it from institutions and society at large. This requires strong government \\ncommitment and major overhaul of ACC. It also requires a ‘whole of government’ approach along \\nwith collaboration with civil society organizations and other stakeholders, as ACC alone will have \\ndifficulty in combating corruption. Hence, the Government will focus on improving the country’s \\nperformance i n the internationally accepted ratings on governance. The following specific measures \\nwill be prioritized: (i) ACC will be empowered to effectively function as an independent institution \\nreporting directly to the head of government by amending legal provis ions if needed; (ii) ACC will \\nnot face any hindrance in investigating offenders, and prosecuting offenders; (iii) ACC will track the \\nassets of public representatives; (iv) the Government will increase resource allocat ion to ACC to \\npermit it to function at a level commensurate with its mandate —these resources include, more staff, \\nfinancial resources and logistical support and enhance automation; (v) with additional resources ACC \\nwill commit to dispensing casing faster and take responsibility for failure; (vi ) ACC  will strengthen \\nits  capacity in modern preventive and investigative anti -corruption methods to improve effectiveness \\nand efficiency; (vi) ACC will  improve transparency by maximi sing information in the public domain \\nand being responsive to RTI filing s and views expressed in the public domain; (vii) ACC  will facilitate \\nmore accountable through public hearings by the parliamentary committee; (viii) Government will \\nestablish anti -corruption cells in relevant departments within an agreed time frame; and ( ix) \\nGovernment will enact the Whistle Blower Act.  \\n\\uf0a7 Strengthening the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh :  The Office of \\nthe Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh are responsible for auditing and reporting on the \\naccounts of  the Republic and of all courts of law and all authorities and officers of the Government. \\nMoreover, policymakers recognize that a transparent supreme audit institution will ensure regular \\nauditing of these bodies and authorities and publish reports for pu blic scrutiny – facilitating general \\naccountability,  views and opinions. Consequently, the government will take measures to develop a \\nregular and effective framework so that the institution utilizes more independent and results -oriented \\naudits. In addition , audit reports need to ensure transparency and accountability by clearly stating the \\nmethods approached.  \\n\\uf0a7 Digitization of Land Management:  Land record digitization will be completed so that it is available \\nto the three nodal offices : (i) land registration,  (ii) Assistant Commissioner of land (ii) Deputy \\nCommissioner of districts. This will ensure ease of access to the data when needed and also quicker \\ndisposal of the land disputes. In particular, digitally maintained particulars of mutation records along \\nwith clear and accurate records generated from plot -wise cadastral surveys of land and registered deeds \\nof land transfer will provide an efficient and transparent basis for authentication of ownership or \\ninheritance including the history of all previous tran sactions.  Moreover, a one -stop service delivery \\nsystem needs to be introduced for better public service delivery.  \\n   \\n \\n186 \\n \\uf0a7 E-Registration:  The Government will continue the process of ensuring that land ownership is \\nmanaged transparently and fairly. It will facilit ate appropriate linkages between the role played by \\nVillage Courts at the local level in relation to resolving land disputes, and the process of formalising \\nland registration, in order to support Vision 2041. The establishment of digital registration and \\npresence of Land Registry Offices in all 64 districts will both simplify the range of registration \\nprocesses, which are often a bar to individuals securing their property rights, as well as promoting \\nspeedy and transparent services.  \\n\\uf0a7 Better Coordination among Concerned Ministry:  To ensure efficient and effective delivery to land -\\nadministration -related e -services, the coordination between Ministry of Land (MoL) and Ministry of \\nLaw, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs (M oLJPA) will be improved, both at the natio nal and at the \\nfield level. Capacity -building programmes  need to be conducted to improve the skills of staff in the \\noffice of the Assistant Commissioner (Land ). Regular monitoring of the work of land offices along \\nwith regular publication of monitoring rep orts will be ensured . The authorities, involved with land \\nadministration, will be strengthened with adequate staff, financial resources and logistical support.  \\n\\uf0a7 Addressing Data Availability:  There is scarcity of data ; data is not  also made available in a ti mely \\nfashion, for example websites are not regularly updated. Availability of data and information will be \\ngiven top priority to improve transparency and for conducting independent evaluation and assessment \\nof government strategies, policies, activities, f unctions, etc. In many instances, the data provided in \\ngovernment websites are not user friendly. All public data collecting agencies, including BBS, needs \\nto be strengthened to address this vital concern.  \\n\\uf0a7 Increasing the Effectiveness of Information Commis sion:  The Government will ensure that the \\nInformation Commission authorit y would  be more responsive to requests made under the Right to \\nInformation Act. Close monitoring of the status of such requests and follow up actions will be ensured \\nto achieve this a nd faster release of the requests for information. The Information Commission will \\nprovide more data on the requests, filings and release of information in the public domain in a timely \\nmanner. Measures will be undertaken to include RTI act in the text boo k. \\n\\uf0a7 More Resources for Governance -related Institutions:  The Government will mobilize more \\nresources to increase ADP allocation to justice institutions, public sector capacity development, \\ndigitization and automation of public sector  organizations , ACC, NBR and PSC’s operations, LGIs \\nfor effective decentralization, reform of the banking sector and capital markets. Moreover, it will take \\nmeasures to ensure that the financial resources earmarked for the ADP projects are disbursed and \\nutilized in a timely manner . \\n\\uf0a7 Strengthening UDCs:  The services provided through Union Digital Centres  (UDCs) are internet -\\nbased. Technology infrastructure in regions where UDCs are located will be enhanced to enable \\nresidents of the regions to access the services of UDCs. Awareness c ampaigns about the operations of \\nUDCs at the local need to be launched.  \\n\\uf0a7 Improving Digital Literacy:  The level of digital literacy of the general public will be enhanced to \\ntandem with the rapid roll out of digitization in the public systems and launching of e-services to \\nenable them to benefit from them. This is also important to prepare people for adjusting with the 4th \\nindustrial revolution.    \\n \\n187 \\n \\uf0a7 Department of Passport and Immigration (DIP): Increased acceptability of Bangladesh passports \\nand visas around the  world will have a positive impact on the export of manpower. To that end, DIP \\nis committed to the simplification of the process of obtaining Bangladesh visas. Simplification and \\nmodernization of the issuing of passports to Bangladesh nationals will also h elp to accelerate export \\nof labour to the overseas markets. This is expected to have a positive implication on remittance \\nearnings. Consequently, the target s for the 8th Plan are: (i) Achieve full coverage of electronic \\npassports by 2025; (ii) Issue  and de livery of passports in a time -bound manner; (iii) Create use -friendly \\nprocedures; and (iv)  Make all necessary information available through the digital space.   \\n\\uf0a7 Strengthening Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED): IMED is the sole \\ngovern ment agent to monitor and evaluate all development activities included in Annual Development \\nProgram (ADP). IMED is now focusing mainly on physical and financial aspects of project \\nimplementation and also conducting mid -term evaluation, terminal evaluation  and in some cases \\nimpact evaluation of completed projects. The government recognizes that without strengthening \\nIMED, updating monitoring tools, introducing results based and real time monitoring, monitoring and \\nevaluation would not be effective. With a v iew to ensuring sustainable development, more measures \\nwill be taken to strengthen IMED for effective implementation of project.  \\n1.5 PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY IN THE 8FYP  \\nThe Government of Bangladesh remains committed to maintain public order and safeguard the assets and \\nlives of its citizens under the 8FYP  period. Guaranteeing the enforcement of the law, protecting the citizens \\nfrom internal and external threats, maintaining security in the border, battling narcotics, terrorism and other \\nsocial vices and rehabi litation of prisoners remain the key objectives of the Ministry of Home Affairs \\n(MoHA). As a result, the MoHA will ensure the cooperation of all the agencies under its jurisdiction to \\noffer the necessary safety and security.  \\nImproving the Effectiveness of  Bangladesh Police: Bangladesh Police, as an organization, remains \\ncommitted to the enforcement of law, ensuring social order, minimizing fear of crime, improving  public \\nsafety and ensuring internal security with active support of the community. In particu lar, creating an \\neffective and accountable police force is fundamental for the enforcement of the rule of law and improving \\nthe criminal justice system. This necessitates activities on multiple dimensions – and under the 8FYP , the \\nfollowing activities will  be prioritized:  \\n\\uf0a7 Strategic Directions and Organizational Reforms:  The Government will formulate strategic \\ndirections  and organizational reforms to support planning and budgeting, enhanced accountability and \\noversight, as well as a modernized legislative fr amework. The primary objective of this is to build the \\ncapacity of the Bangladesh Police to formulate and implement its organizational vision.   \\n\\uf0a7 Enhancement of Efficiency of the Police Personnel through Capacity Building at Home and \\nAbroad and through Moder n Training Centres:  Proper initiatives will be undertaken to increase \\nskills and competency of police personnel by means of arranging training, workshops and seminars in \\nthe country.  Police officials will be sent to the overseas to equip them with the lat est policing \\nknowledge, best practices and development in view of addressing recent issues and problems in \\nBangladesh. Appropriate budget allocation will be provided to implement the initiative  of enhancing \\ncapacity of training institutes and capability of  police personnel.  Adequate initiatives will also be taken   \\n \\n188 \\n to improve the infra -structure, equipment, transport and ICT facilities for furnishing a total of 30 In -\\nService Training Centres of Bangladesh Police. The facilitators and instructors of In -Service  Training \\nCentres will be trained at home and abroad through some capacity building projects. The In -service \\ntraining centres would be utilized up to the maximum level to impart knowledge, skills and changed \\nattitude to the field level police officers. The  existing training centres would be made women -friendly \\nwith respect to quality of training , infrastructures and allied services  \\n\\uf0a7 Developing Infrastructure and Improving Capacity of the Anti -Terrorism Unit (ATU):  Required \\ninitiatives will be undertaken to d evelop infra -structure for ATU in Dhaka and all over the country to \\ncurb terrorism and religious militancy. Besides, modern equipment will be procured and forensic labs \\nwill be set up  in this purpose . In addition, Counter -Terrorism policy will be formulate d incorporating \\nother stakeholders in the initiative of ATU.  \\n\\uf0a7 Setting up Forensic Labs in Six Divisional Cities: Forensic science has been an essential part of \\nmodern police performances. Modern investigation process is based  on forensic evidence. Prosecuti on \\nof criminals and the clearance of innocent suspects become easier if forensic evidence is analysed \\nproperly and timely. At the same time, quick disposal of chemical and forensic Alamats expedite the \\nquick disposal of pending cases of the police stations . For this reasons Bangladesh Police has \\nestablished a central forensic lab , which  has been proved as an effective facility in terms of quick \\ndisposal of Alamats and forensic evidence. For this reason,  six more forensic labs will be established \\nto make Ban gladesh Police an effective investigating agency, which will be prioritized under the \\n8FYP .  \\n\\uf0a7 Improvement in Investigation, Operations and Prosecution:  The Government will increase efforts \\nto improve police operations, investigation and prosecution to enhan ce fair and equitable justice. In \\nparticular, Grievance Redressal  Systems (GRS) will be introduced into police administration more \\neffectively  to ensure fair treatment of both police offic ials and citizens.  In particular , IGP’s Complaint \\nCell will be more effective as a Grievance Redressal  System to ensure fair treatment to both police \\noffic ials and citizens.     \\n\\uf0a7 Crime Prevention and Community Policing:  Measures will be taken to improve the trust and \\ninteraction between the community and the Police resulting  in improved access to justice, human rights \\nand reduced fear of crime.  Bangladesh Police is applying Bit Policing technique countrywide as an \\nimplementation tool of community policing.   \\n Under the 8FYP , these efforts will be further strengthened to enhanc e better policing services for the \\ncitizens.  In particular, e fforts of finding durable solutions to reduce crime through community policing \\nwould be conti nued. The Community policing would be made functional through practical initiatives \\nlike: (a) Communi ty Policing Forums; (b) Sector -wise community involvement; (c) Open house day; \\n(d) Bit meetings ; (e) Youth and Student involvements; (f) School/ College based awareness \\nprogrammes ; (g) Mass meeting/ Rallies; (h) Anticrime meetin gs; (i) Victim Re -contract; ( j) Door to \\ndoor/ home to home visits.  \\n\\uf0a7 Promoting Gender Sensitive Policing:  The government is committed to ensure the rights of women \\nand children at all levels by ensuring equitable and sensitive policing and support services for the \\nvictims . In particular , it will develop a Woman Policing Strategy (WPS) through the Bangladesh Police \\nto mitigate gender discrimination in policing services.    \\n \\n189 \\n \\uf0a7 Digitalization of all Police Stations:  With a view to implementing vision -2021 and vision -2041, \\ndifferent steps will be  taken to digitize all police stations of Bangladesh Police for making them fully \\naccessible to the citizens from all walks  of life . Police Stations need  to be interconnected electronically \\nto reduce time, resources and workforce in terms of making daily t ransactions. In addition, web -based \\napplications will be introduced to preserve legal documents and perform policing activities like online  \\nGeneral Diary  (GD), investigation, enquiry etc.  \\n\\uf0a7 Strengthening and Building Capacity of 999 National Emergency Servic e: National Emergency \\nService, 999 is a popular public enterprise undertaken by the present government. People at stake find \\n999 services as their cyber saviour. It has already enkindled hope in general masses to secure a space  \\nin the criminal justice syst em. Furthermore, 999 service has become popular with the distressed and \\nfire-victims. The increasing number of calls at the 999 service will be handled promptly and \\nefficiently. So, investments in the necessary infrastructure of the 999 centre and developi ng a pool of \\ntrained human resource will receive priority under the 8th Plan.  \\n\\uf0a7 Reducing Cybercrime and Fake News:  The Government remains committed to reducing cybercrime \\nand will undertake the necessary capacity building measures and investments in technolo gy that will \\nallow the prevention of cybercrime in the society. Especially, measures will be taken to reduce the \\nmisuse of social media networks to disrupt communal harmony through the spreading of “fake news” \\nthat hurt religious sentiments of any communit y.   \\n\\uf0a7 Model Police Stations (MPS):  Police Reform Project I & II supported the creation of Model Police \\nStations  (MPS) which benefit from better facilities, such as customer service areas, barracks and toilets  \\nfor women, separate holding cells for men and wo men, secure facilities for firearms, private interview \\nrooms and accessibility ramps. Moreover, under the 8FYP , the Bangladesh Police will  continue to \\nprovide services from “Model Police Stations” to improve the facilities for delivery of services.  \\n\\uf0a7 Enhanc ed CCTV and Other Surveillance Mechanisms:  Under the 8th Plan, the Government will \\nensure that selected metropolitan police jurisdictions and selected portions of highways would be \\nbrought  under the surveillance of CCTVs to  increase the state of safety on national highways and key \\ncities.  \\n\\uf0a7 Combat Human Trafficking: Public Security Division (PSD)  of MoHA is the focal division to \\ncombat human trafficking. Th is Division has formed the National Authority to address this crime \\nunder the Prevention and Suppressio n of Human Trafficking Act 2012. In 2018, PSD has adopted the \\nNational Plan of Action to Prevent and Suppress of Human Trafficking (NPA -PSHT) 2018 -2022. The \\nNPA 2018 -22 is harmonized with the SDG implementation strategy of GoB. Under the 8FYP , PSD \\naims to strengthen the capacity of the National Authority to better implement the NPA. During the \\nimplementation of the 8FYP , this Authority can grow into the lead agency to coordinate all out efforts \\nagainst the traffickers. As a priority, PSD plays a critical ro le in enforcement of legal provisions \\n(Migrants Act 2013 and PSHT Act 2012) to make mobility of people, migration and migrants safer.  \\nThe 8FYP  will focus in  invest ing in capacity development for law enforcement and border control to \\ncombat trafficking and smuggling in persons. As per NPA the counter trafficking committees (CTCs ) \\nare placed at Unions, Upazi las and Districts to reduce vulnerability to trafficking and to assist the \\nvictims of trafficking. The 8FYP  can provide resources and capacity building as sistance to strengthen \\nand activate these CTCs. Hence during the 8FYP , the government will set priority on strengthening \\nthe role of PSD in meeting the objectives set in the NPA to prevent and suppress human trafficking.    \\n \\n190 \\n \\uf0a7 Ensure repatriation and rehabilitat ion of Rohingyas: Being denied  citizenship, more than one \\nmillion Rohingyas have crossed into Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Government deserves enormous \\ncredit for all it has done to help these destitute people. Under the leadership of Honourable Prime \\nMinist er Sheikh Hasina, the worst potential consequences of this human calamity have been avoided \\ndespite the incredibly difficult circumstances. Bangladesh is making every effort in a professional \\nfashion to harness regional and global power to end this emergin g crisis. The Bangladesh government \\nhas been making diplomatic efforts in persuading Myanmar to repatriate the refugees. Bangladesh is  \\nlooking forward to the successful repatriation of the Rohingya to Myanmar and enable them to have \\naccess to different dim ensions of human security. Considering the issues of overcrowding, congestion, \\nand security in Cox’s Bazar, the government of Bangladesh has been developing a relocation site in \\n‘Bhasan Char’ island to  rehabilate  the Rohingya refugees. Efforts will be cont inued to ensure peaceful \\nstay of these forcibly displaced Myanmar citizens until repatriation in Myanmar.  \\nBorder Guard Bangladesh (BGB):  The Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) is entrusted with the security \\nof the borders, addressing and minimization of smuggli ng and protection of the economic and commercial \\ninterests of Bangladesh. In particular, attaining effectiveness on such fronts allows the BGB to minimize \\nthe smuggling of foreign goods/commodities and reduce the evasion of duties – which would otherwise \\ncreate uneven competition between the foreign goods and the goods manufactured /produced  in the country. \\nIn 2017, the BGB adopted a long -term strategy named \"BGB Goal 2041\". This strategy aims to make the \\nBGB a well -trained, well -equipped and technologically advanced force.  Thus, to improve the effectiveness \\nof the BGB, the 8FYP  will prioritize the achievement  of the targets within BGB Goal 2041. In particular, \\nspecific focus will be offered to the following areas:  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing the number of personnel working f or the BGB to meet the international standards;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing investments in logistics that facilitate the effective functioning of the BGB;  \\n\\uf0b7 Support ing formation and strengthening of a “Quick Response Force” within the BGB which will \\nwork to supply modern ar ms and ammunition to the border points swiftly in case of any emergency;  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing a permanent station on the St Martin’s island to protect the territorial integrity of \\nBangladesh;  \\n\\uf0b7 Installing mechanized inspection system in Benapole and other land borde rs;  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhancing the security of the international boundary between Bangladesh, India and Myanmar \\nthrough increasing the number Border Out Posts (BOP) and the construction of border ring roads and \\nbarbed wire fencings;  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing a comprehensive strategy wi th all stakeholders to reduce smuggling;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing operation to reduce human trafficking mainly women and children in neighbouring \\ncountries;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increas ing supervision of the Myanmar border to maintain peace at the Rohingya camps.  \\nBangladesh Coast Guard ( BCG): The Bangladesh Coast Guard  (BCG) is designed and formulated to \\nenforce the maritime laws of Bangladesh. It is a paramilitary force and operates under the jurisdiction of \\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs . Its officers serve under deputation from the Bangladesh Navy . Additionally, \\nthe BCG also perform s the duty of maintaining the maritime border security of Bangladesh. During the \\n7FYP period, the Government has also articulated the - Coast Guard Goal 2030 - which is a strategic \\ndocument to modernize the Bangladesh Coast Guard . More specifically, the plan aims to improve the \\norganizational capacity of the BCG by increasing the manpower, purchasing more ships , hovercraft ,   \\n \\n191 \\n helicopters , Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  (UAV) , maritime patrol aircraft s and adding new generation \\nsurveillance technologies. The vision is  to make the BCG a technologically advanced two -dimensional \\nforce that is capable of protecting the coastal areas of Bangladesh well. Moreover, it will support the \\nBangladesh  Navy  during all national emergencies. Hence, under the 8FYP period, the Government will \\nprioritize implementing the targets as noted in the “Coast Guard Goal 2030”. It will also ensure that the \\nstrategic objectives of the “Blue Economy” agenda are protec ted by ensuring the safety of our marine \\nresources.   \\nBangladesh Ansar and Village Defence Party (VDP): The Bangladesh Ansar  is a paramilitary  auxiliary \\nforce , which is entrusted to maintain  internal security  and law enforcement  in Bangladesh. Its operation is \\nadministered by the Ministry of  Home Affairs – and under the 8FYP  period, the following initiatives will \\nbe taken to strengthen the role of the Ansar and Village Defence Party (VDP):     \\n\\uf0a7 The Government will enhance its capacity to effectively dispensing public welfare activities as per  \\nthe instruction of the Government effectively;  \\n\\uf0a7 It will receive logistical support to ensure that it can effectively support the Bangladesh Armed \\nForces in any national emergency.   \\nDepartment of Prisons : The Department of Prisons aims to ensure safe custo dy of prisoners, maintain \\nstrict discipline among the inmates and prison security, ensure humanely treatment of all prisoners; provide \\ndecent accommodation, food, medicine of the prisoners, as well as opportunities to meet their relatives, \\nfriends and lawy ers and provide necessary training and motivation to the prisoners, in order to rehabilitate \\nas a good citizen in the society. As a result, under the 8FYP , the Government aims to ensure better facilities \\nfor prisoners, by allowing them  to have access to pr ofessional training and counselling  services, develop \\nadvanced infrastructure to reduce prisoner burden – and provide special care for female and under -aged \\nprisoners.  \\nFire Service & Civil Defence: The 7th Plan period witnessed numerous incidents of fire h azards that \\nresulted in the death of hundreds of people. In fact, over the last twenty -three years – the average incidents \\nof fire per years has increased threefold - with the year 2018 seeing a daily average of 53. More specifically, \\nat least 1,970 people  were killed in around 200,000 fires across the country between 2004 and 2018. \\nConsequently, under the 8FYP , the Government will strengthen the capacity of the Fire Service and Civil \\nDefence department to ensure public safety by investing in training of ke y emergency personals, importing \\nnecessary technologies and fire -fighting instruments to effectively carryout rescue operation during any \\nman-made or natural disasters. The Government will also develop a surveillance team under the Fire \\nService Department to monitor hazardous economic activities, so that fire safety regulations are effectively \\nenforced across the key “fire -hotspots” of the country.   \\nNarcotics Control Department (DNC): The 7th Plan period witnessed a strong commitment to anti -\\nnarcotics driv e by the Government and remains a key component of the elect ion manifesto of the current \\nGovernment. Hence, under the 8FYP, the Government will undertake the following activities: (i) It will \\nstrengthen the Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) to reduce  the availability and usage of narcotics in \\nthe country. In particular, strong surveillance teams will be developed to stop drug trafficking across \\nborders, so that key supply chains aiding the entry of drugs from various parts of the regions are disrupted; \\n(ii)  The Government will also support strong awareness building campaigns in both private and public \\nschools, colleges and universities, to ensure students understand the adverse consequences of drug usage;   \\n \\n192 \\n (iii) The Government will create partnership wit h NGOs to develop a state of the art rehabilitation hospitals \\nin every administrative Division of Bangladesh to ensure affordable treatment and effective  rehabilitation \\nof drug addicts in the country.  \\nNational Tele -Communication  Monitoring Centre (NTMC):  The NTMC was formed in 2014 to \\nimprove the state of security and stability of the country by rigorously monitoring over all branches and \\nmedium of latest telecommunication arena. This organization provides a platform for all law enforcing \\nagencies to moni tor the activities of suspected threats. The threat in cyber space is radically different from \\nothers. The objective of NTMC for 8th Plan are as follows: (i) Support the procurement of state -of-the-art \\ntechnological devices that can protect citizens from t errorist organizations; (ii) Increase parliamentary \\naudits of its expenditure to ensure more public scrutiny of its expenditure; (iii) More investments in training,  \\ninfrastructural facilities to accommodate all major components of NTMC like data centre, m onitoring \\nstation and physical security measures; (iv) Deploy necessary IT experts to deal with emerging threats from \\ntelecommunication sectors; (v) Ensure annual hearings of NTMC officials with the Honourable  Prime \\nMinister and Defence Advisors to ensure that basic privacy of citizens are not violated.  \\n1.6 DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION UNDER THE 8FYP  \\nThe Government believes that improvements in public administration, public institutions and governance \\nis fundamental for attaining the growth and poverty redu ction targets of PP2041 and it requires noticeable \\nimprovement under the 8FYP. More specifically, the need for a more effective coordination mechanism  \\ncontinued strong political leadership, forward -looking attitude within government employee s and an \\neffect ive, transparent and accountable legal framework that guides governance within the public \\nadministration cannot be overstated. It is also essential to recognize that in order for the country to maintain \\nits solid momentum in its socio -economic progress, no t only it requires an enabling and effective public \\nadministration and institutions, it also needs an environment where  there is order, public safety, and rule of \\nlaw that ensures investments and exchanges within the commercial sphere enjoy predictable, ef fective and \\nequitable legal framework. This, nonetheless, considerable investment in institutions will ensure that they \\nare guided by the most adequate laws, infrastructure and human capital.  \\nAccordingly, the 8FYP is committed to provide adequate resource s to enable the smooth function of general \\nadministration and law and order to ensure safety and security. Most of the spending for general public \\nservices and law and order are recurrent in nature and are therefore provided for from the current budget, \\nyet, it is understood that many development projects are necessary to enhance capacity and strengthen the \\nunderlying services. Therefore, in addition to allocations for current spending from the national budget, the \\n8th Plan provides sizable resources from t he ADP.  The indicative ADP allocations are contained in Table \\n1.7. Nonetheless, need based changes are possible to key areas of public administration given the Plan aims \\nto be a living document – and it recognizes flexibility and adaptability are fundamen tal for achieving the \\nbroader objectives of the 8FYP that is linked to PP2041.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n193 \\n  \\nTable 1.7: 8FYP Ministry -wise ADP Allocation for General Public S ervices and Public Order and Safety \\nin Current Prices (Taka billion)  \\nNo. Sector  Ministry/ Division  FY2021  FY2022  FY23  FY2024  FY2025  \\n1.

Therefore, besides the challenge of \\nsustaining economic and social progress, the 8FYP will have to start off with an economic recovery progr am \\nthat can then morph into the medium -term development agenda for rapid pro -poor and inclusive growth as \\nenvisioned in PP2041. The challenge is particularly telling because COVID -19 has been most damaging to \\nthe engine of past growth, the RMG sector, wher e the slump in world demand has already cost the economy \\na colossal loss of $10 billion in exports in the first 4 months of the FY2021.  \\nThe period of the 8FYP straddles two key milestones for the Bangladesh economy: (a) 2021 is the 50th \\nanniversary of ind ependence of Bangladesh, and (b) the economy is set to graduate out of UN’s LDC group \\nof nations in 2024. Given the stage of our social and economic progress, the Government is determined to \\nembrace graduation and prepare for the challenges that may be exp ected – primarily arising from the process \\nof “trade preference erosion”. That calls for trade and industrial policy to be revamped during the 8FYP to \\ncope with the impending challenges. A particularly important task is to diversify the manufacturing \\nprodu ction and export base to insulate the economy from adverse developments associated with dependence \\non one single product group. The other task is to restructure manufacturing sector in a way that it creates \\nmore jobs as it grows, notwithstanding the ramifi cations of technology change and growing capital intensity \\nof production associated with the on-going  Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).  \\nBut first, the economy must deal with the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic that has swept the globe with \\nspeed and imp act on global output and trade. The fact that in 2020 Bangladesh economy is far more \\nintegrated with the world economy through trade and financial flows makes it highly likely that the global \\nslowdown this time will have far greater ramifications on our ex ports, remittances, GDP growth and \\nemployment than was the case in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 -09. So, the first year \\nof the 8FYP will have to cope with the challenges of an economic recovery that will need robust policies \\nto stimu late trade and growth in order to protect livelihoods of millions of vulnerable people including non -\\npoor that are on the brink of poverty. In the first phase of policy response, the Government has launched a \\n$12 billion (over Tk.1 trillion) stimulus (or r elief) package to cushion the economy from the immediate \\nhealth -cum-economic shock. The FY2021 Budget should comprise the economic recovery package that \\nwill launch the 8FYP to fuel economic recovery and resume the growth trajectory that was laid during th e \\npast 10 years. Yet, in light of the severe global economic slowdown in the aftermath of COVID -19 crisis, \\nmost global analysts are predicting a slow recovery rather than a sharp bounce back (V -shaped recovery). \\nSince future trade (i.e. exports and imports ) is a function of the state of global demand for Bangladeshi \\nproducts and supply of essential agricultural and manufacturing products (food and intermediate inputs)   \\n \\n198 \\n that enter the production and consumption system of Bangladesh, it is important to keep th e global \\neconomic scenario as the backdrop of domestic policies directed towards boosting the manufacturing sector \\nthat is and will be the major driver of rapid growth and employment creation over the period of the 8FYP.  \\nTrade Policy and Industrialization   \\nThe broad goals of Bangladesh’s industrial policy can be classified into two tracks: import -substituting \\nindustrial development and export -oriented industrialization. This creates the need for industrial policy to \\nbe in tandem with trade policy, as the t wo-track industrialization policy raises issues of complementarity \\nas well as conflict in the articulation of incentives between the two strands of trade policy – import \\nsubstitution and export promotion. As part of policy fundamentals, the two -pronged app roach of import -\\nsubstituting and export -oriented industrialization brings to the fore the choice of two broad competing \\nstrategies: comparative -advantage -following (CAF) or comparative -advantage -defying (CAD). The CAF \\nindustrial and trade policies are thos e that promote economic activities based on the country’s comparative \\nadvantage (e.g. labour -intensive production) while CAD policies do not necessarily select activities with \\ncomparative advantage (e.g. promoting capital intensive import -substituting indu stries with heavy \\nprotection in a labour  abundant economy). In articulating trade and industrial policies during the period of \\nthe 8FYP these two approaches will be kept in perspective.  \\nA sound industrial policy should complement market forces, maximizing  the potential for the industrial \\nsector to contribute to economic growth and job creation. In practice, Bangladesh industrial policy has \\nmultiple objectives including employment creation, promoting structural change towards an industrial \\neconomy, enhancin g technological capacity, improving regional distribution of industrial activity, \\npromoting investment in laggard regions, and facilitating more even income distribution. While it might be \\ntempting to cover wide ranging goals the 8th Five Year Plan (2021 -25) acknowledges that prioritization is \\nof critical importance as industrial policy to be effective must have limited and clearly defined objectives, \\nsimply because there are not sufficient policy instruments to address multiple objectives. Moreover, \\ndiffer ent objectives may be inconsistent with each other. Thus, the principal focus of our industrial policy \\nduring the 8FYP  will be to achieve structural transformation where industry’s share in GDP would reach \\n40-45% of GDP by 2030 thereby absorbing the bulk o f the labour  force that was hitherto under -employed \\nin agriculture and informal services. Furthermore, to develop a globally competitive manufacturing sector \\nthe strategy would be to provide support to infant industries with time -bound and performance -based \\ncriteria. Strategic coordination between the state and businesses in formulation and implementation of \\nindustrial policy is the accepted practice in Bangladesh.  \\nFinally, Bangladesh’s industrial policy for the 21st century (post -LDC graduation) has to be  comprehensive \\nrather than target specific in order to be WTO -consistent. Policies for promoting industries to stimulate \\ninvestment or export growth are then restricted to generic instead of specific policy instruments with some \\nscope for transitional arra ngements under Special and Differential treatment with de minimis provisions. \\nGeneric policies for promoting industrial development include policies related to infrastructure, human \\ncapital formation, innovation, and diffusion of technology, all critical f or export competitiveness.  \\nThe concurrent trade policy will have to be supportive of the industrialization strategy focusing on \\ndeveloping a globally competitive manufacturing sector with strong and sustainable export performance. \\nThe strategic approach w ill be to leverage the vast global marketplace via greater trade openness that   \\n \\n199 \\n involves greater trade integration with major players in the regional and global economy. There is no option \\nbut for high and sustainable growth of the future to be driven by ro bust trade and export performance \\nleveraging the enormous demand potential of the global marketplace.  \\nIn the post -LDC graduation environment trade may need to be reshaped in line with WTO rules. Subsidies \\nfor export promotion may not be available after gr aduation but other subsidies for regional development, \\nR&D; environment etc. may be used more extensively for competitiveness development of exportable \\nproducts.  \\n2.2 BANGLADESH TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL POLICIES IN RETROSPECT  \\nWhen it comes to trade and industrial policy Bangladesh began its development journey burdened by the \\nlegacy of past policies. It inherited highly restrictive trade policies that carried import substitution strategy \\nto its extreme through high protective tariffs and import bans on a wide range  of importable commodities. \\nAt independence since the economy was devoid of any foreign exchange reserves, this strategy was thought \\nto be appropriate for saving precious foreign exchange and ensuring a sustainable balance of payments \\nsituation.  As for th e industry, by default, the state became owners of a vast pool of jute, textile and other \\nindustries that were owned and operated by Pakistani entrepreneurs who abandoned them as they moved to \\nPakistan. Furthermore, state ownership of large industry – nationalization – was adopted as national policy \\nin 1972, thereby bringing within the fold of government management many large jute and textiles mills \\nowned by Bangladeshi industrialists. Though private enterprise in manufacturing was still permitted within \\nlimits public enterprises dominated the industrial sector thus determining resource allocation, investment \\nand production. Market competition was severely constrained in the presence of public monopolies which, \\nas expected, operated inefficiently, making los ses and drawing endlessly from the national exchequer.  \\nThroughout these years, the economy was characterized by slow growth, at a time when other South Asian \\ncountries recorded faster GDP growth. The share of manufacturing in GDP, which was 10.2% in 1975 -76, \\nwas down to 9.8% in 1990 -91, without showing much traction in industrial growth. The policy of import -\\nsubstituting industrialization with high tariffs and import bans produced neither manufacturing jobs nor \\nindustrial progress, nor the kind of growth n eeded to make a dent on the poverty situation. Consequently, \\nin the final years of the 1980s, Bangladesh economy was engulfed in a severe macroeconomic crisis that \\ninvolved foreign exchange shortages, the balance of payments difficulties, and fiscal imbala nces in the \\ndomestic economy. Structural reforms were long overdue if the economy were to survive.  \\nIndeed, the economy turned a page in the 1990s by undertaking structural reforms that included \\ndenationalization program, further liberalization of agricult ural input markets, engaging in financial sector \\nreforms, streamlining monetary policy to reduce inflation, all combined with de -regulatory measures to \\nenhance the role of private sector enterprises. Trade policy changed direction towards outward orientati on, \\nwith tariff and import liberalization, exchange rate flexibility, current account convertibility, including a \\nhost of supporting measures that encapsulated a strategy of export -led growth. All of these reforms in the \\n1990s together contributed to the l ift-off in GDP growth of Bangladesh.  \\nBy the close of the 1990s, Bangladesh economy was included among a select group of developing \\neconomies described as “globalizers” by the World Bank. A 2004 World Bank study of developing \\ncountries found that, unlike n on-globalizers, countries that were “globalizers” experienced growth   \\n \\n200 \\n acceleration as well as poverty reduction in the 1990s3.  This was also Bangladesh’s experience starting \\nfrom the 1990s decade. After unsuccessfully targeting 5% GDP growth for the first two decades post -\\nindependence, for the first time GDP growth in the 1990s averaged 5% for the decade while export growth \\nfor the first time crossed double digits averaging 12%. Particularly the period of 1996 -2001 experienced a \\nrobust growth in export led growth of Bangladesh economy due to trade liberalization. Being a founding \\nmember of the WTO that was established in 1995 gave reasonable prediction and market stability in the \\nworld with preferential market access by developed nations.  \\nDuring the first de cade of the 21st century, industrial and trade policies evolved around the basic tenets of \\na free market economy with generous bits of government intervention in regulatory control of the economy \\nwhile the private sector was acknowledged as the key driver of the economy as far as production and \\ninvestment activities were concerned. Despite some occasional political setback, export -led growth took on \\na new meaning for the Bangladesh economy with the emergence of readymade garments (RMG) as the \\nleading export  industry overtaking jute and jute goods as the primary export product of the country. RMG \\nexports overtook jute and jute goods as the predominant export item reaching 70% share in the export basket \\nby close of the 1990s. During the period of the 6th and 7FYP RMG march continued with increasing export \\nconcentration, introducing export vulnerability on that account, though Bangladesh emerged as the No.2 \\nexporter of apparels after China, with Vietnam now a close No.3 posing serious competition in US and EU \\nmarkets, the competition that is likely to become even more acute as Vietnam has signed an FTA with EU \\nand joined the recently established plurilateral free -trade club of East Asia and the Pacific, Comprehensive \\nand Progressive Agreement for Trans -Pacific Pa rtnership (CPTPP) .  \\nTable 2.1: Trade and Tariff Policy Trends during  6th and 7FYP  \\n FY11  FY12  FY13  FY14  FY15  FY16  FY17  FY18  FY19  FY20  \\nAverage NPR  23.74  26.96  28.93  28.09  26.69  25.60  25.64  26.55  26.70  26.75  \\nAverage Output \\nTariff ( *) 41.29  43.49  46.82  45.98  43.16  41.32  40.55  38.79  39.64  46.43  \\nAverage Input \\nTariff (**)  12.5 12.72  13.02  12.17  12.02  11.63  12.13  12.57  12.03  13.52  \\nExports  \\n($ billion)  22.9 24.3 26.6 30.2 31.2 34.2 34.8 36.6 39.6 32.8 \\nExport growth  41.5 6 9.3 13.6 3.4 9.7 1.7 5.2 8.2 (-) 17.2 \\nImports  \\n($ billion)  32.5 33.3 33.6 36.6 37.7 39.9 43.5 54.5 55.4   50.7 \\nImport growth  52.1 2.4 0.8 8.9 3.0 5.9 9.0 25.3 1.7 (-) 8.5 \\nSource: BBS; GED estimates based on NBR data;  \\nNotes: NPR=Nominal Protection Rates; (*) Output tariffs refer to NPR on mainl y consumer goods; (**) Input tariffs refer to \\nNPR on basic raw materials, intermediate and capital goods.  \\n \\n \\n                                                     \\n3  Trade, Growth and Po verty, David Dollar and Art Kray, 2014    \\n \\n201 \\n Table 2.2: Industrial Sector Performance 6 FYP  \\n FY11  FY12  FY13  FY14  FY15  \\n Share  growth  Share  growth  Share  Growth  Share  growth  Share  Growth  \\nManufa cturing  17.7 10.0 18.3 10.0 19.0 10.3 19.5 8.8 20.2 10.3 \\nIndustry  27.4 9.0 28.1 9.4 29.0 9.6 29.6 8.2 30.4 9.7 \\nGDP growth   6.5  6.5  6.0  6.1  6.1 \\n Source:  BBS  \\nTable 2.3: Industrial Sector Performance 7 FYP  \\n FY16  FY17  FY18  FY19  FY20  \\n Share  growth  Share growth  Share  Growth  Share  growth  Share  Growth  \\nManufacturing  21.01  10.30  21.74  10.97  22.85  13.40  24.08 14.73  24.18  5.84 \\nIndustry  31.54  10.10  32.48  10.5 33.66  12.06  35.00 13.02  35.36  6.48 \\nGDP growth   7.1  7.3  7.9  8.2  5.2 \\nSource: BBS  \\nProgress during 6FYP  and 7FYP : With the launch of the 6FYP began the most prosperous decade of \\nBangladesh’s development experience. Both the 6th and 7th Five Year Plans articulated trade and industrial \\nstrategies and approaches that were designed to generate high rates of  growth with macroeconomic stability. \\nInternal and external macroeconomic stability having been maintained, for the first time Bangladesh \\nexperienced 7 -8%+ annual GDP growth during the 7FYP. In contrast to the average GDP growth that \\nincreased by roughly o ne percentage point each decade until FY2010, average annual GDP growth rose by \\none percentage point every five years during the 6th (6.3%) and 7FYP  (7.6%). The share of industry in GDP \\nrose from 27% in FY2011 to 35% in FY2019, with the share of manufactur ing rising from 18% to 24% \\nduring the same period (Tables 2.1 -2.3). Manufacturing growth averaged 10% during the 6th Plan and 12.3% \\nduring the 7th Plan playing the principal driver of growth acceleration.  \\nHowever, trade policy stance remained practically unchanged after some modest reforms in tariffs and \\ncustoms practices during the first decade of the 21st century. The economy reaped the benefits of trade \\nliberalization and deregulation in industrial investment. Trade and tariff liberalization of the 1990 s soon \\ngave way to the compensating emergence of para -tariffs in the form of Regulatory Duties (RD) and \\nSupplementary Duties (SD) thus leaving average nominal and effective protection levels practically \\nunchanged for much of the decade (Table 2.1). Though export performance could have been far more \\ndynamic with CAF -based export -oriented trade policies proposed in the two Plans but left largely \\nunimplemented, average double -digit growth of 11.2% was still maintained boosted mainly by the 41.5% \\ngrowth spurt r ecorded for FY2011. For much of the 7FYP  export growth was sluggish averaging a mere \\n6.8% until FY2019.  \\nThough trade liberalization and export -led manufacturing growth became the principal strategy of growth, \\na fundamental conflict emerged between trade a nd industrial policies since the close of the 1990s decade. \\nThe industrial policy made no particular distinction between export -oriented industries and import -\\nsubstituting industries in incentivizing “thrust” sectors. The promotion of “winners” was based p rimarily \\non current successes and presumption of potentially successful industries. Though average tariffs were   \\n \\n202 \\n falling moderately, the decline was mainly due to a reduction in input tariffs while output tariffs remained \\nstubbornly elevated resulting in pe rsistently higher effective rates of protection. In comparison incentives \\nfor exports (through subsidies or concessional credits) were no match to the higher levels of protection to \\nimport substitutes. Thankfully, the RMG sector remained largely outside th e ambit of the tariff regime \\nbecause of the free trade regime they enjoyed though Special Bonded Warehouse facility that ensured inputs \\nat international prices. Compared to the non -RMG exports, the RMG sector suffered no such handicap and \\ncontinued with do uble-digit export growth until the end of the 6FYP .  \\nAppreciation of the real exchange rate:  A major factor underlying the weakening of export performance \\nduring the 7FYP was the cumulative effect of appreciation of the real exchange rate since 2006. The T aka \\nappreciated by 36% in real terms against the US dollar over the periods 2005 -06 and 2018 -19 (Figure 2.1).  \\nThe appreciation against the Euro happened a couple of years later from 2007 -08. From then until 2018 -\\n19, the taka appreciated by 48% in real ter ms (Figure 2.2). This extra appreciation against the Euro reflects \\nthe fact that Taka is loosely pegged with the US dollar, which has strengthened significantly against the \\nEuro. The resultant appreciation of the dollar also transmitted into an additional source of taka appreciation \\nagainst the Euro. These appreciations of the Taka in real terms against the two dominant global currencies \\nwhere Bangladesh conducts much of its export trade was a real problem that substantially hurt export \\nprospects and stemme d the diversification of exports.  \\nFigure 2.1: Bangladesh -US Dollar Nominal and Real Exchange Rate Trends  \\n \\n        Source: GED estimates based on BB data  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 0.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0090.00Tk/USD (nominal) Tk/USD (real)  \\n \\n203 \\n Figure 2.2: Bangladesh Taka -Euro Nominal and Real Exchange Rate Trends  \\n \\nSource: GED estimates  based on BB data  \\nBased on the available evidence, the conclusion is that the large anti -export bias of trade protection and the \\nadditional substantial loss in export competitiveness owing to the appreciation of the real exchange rate \\nbasically rendered th e cash subsidies and other fiscal incentives for exports as ineffective instruments of \\nexport growth and diversification. Export growth plummeted since FY2017 and is yet to recover its long -\\nterm trend of the past. Proper management of the exchange rate to boost exports will be a major policy \\nfocus of the 8FYP.  \\n2.3 LESSONS OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE  \\nIn planning trade and industrial strategies for the next five years, Bangladesh can learn from the positive \\nexperience of developing economies that adopted trade an d industrial strategies that yielded huge dividends \\nin terms of rapid growth and poverty reduction. Notable among these are once the East Asian Tigers (i.e. \\nKorea, Taiwan (China), Hong Kong (China), Singapore), high -performing economies of Malaysia, \\nThaila nd, Indonesia, China, and, more recently, Vietnam. Figure 2.3 gives a picture of the extraordinary \\nexport performance (in manufacturing goods) of the East Asian Tigers during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. \\nChina surpassed their performance in export growth i n the 1980s, 1990s, and thereafter. Vietnam is a new \\nentrant to the club of high export performers. From poor developing economies in the 1960s, the East Asian \\nTigers joined the ranks of developed countries in about 50 years.  \\nThe development paradigm of e xport -led growth emerged out of the experience of the high -performing \\nEast Asian countries which led other developing countries to adopt strategies of trade openness with CAF -\\nbased export orientation, departing – some more speedily than others - from the p revious policies of CAD -\\nbased import substituting industrialization. To pursue this change of direction in trade and industrial policies \\nLDCs and other developing countries received guidance and financial support of multilateral agencies like \\nthe World Ban k and IMF.  \\n 0.0020.0040.0060.0080.00100.00120.00Taka/EuroTaka/Euro (real) Tk/Euro (nominal)  \\n \\n204 \\n Figure 2.3: Growth Rates of Manufactured Exports (%) of East Asian Tigers  \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank  \\nResearch by leading trade and development economists reveal two strains of policies pursued: (a) openness \\nto int ernational trade based on largely neutral incentives between exports and import substitute production, \\nand (b) selective industrial policy interventions, which often used trade policy instruments, in order to shift \\nindustrial structures towards newer and m ore modern sectors to capture opportunities from dynamic scale \\neconomies in the global marketplace. During their heavy and chemical industries (HCI) programmes , Japan \\nand Korea were the most active in promoting individual industries and sectors. Singapore and Taiwan have \\nalso actively provided incentives for technological upgrading. Malaysia had an HCI program reminiscent \\nof Japan\\'s and Korea\\'s, while Indonesia has attempted to leapfrog from labour -intensive manufacturing to \\nhigh-technology industries such as machineries and electronics.  \\nEarly writing on trade policy and growth stressed the benefits of neutral incentives between production for \\nthe domestic market and production for export. With neutral incentives, it was argued;  resources would \\nflow to sect ors in which the economy was most internationally competitive. Later theoretical work shows \\nthat, where market power, economies of scale, learning, or externalities are significant, departures from \\nneutral incentives to favouring  export production improves  export performance. As far as government \\nintervention is concerned, evidence shows that, on the one hand, government efforts to promote specific \\nindustries generally did not increase economy wide  productivity. On the other hand, broad government \\nsupport f or exports was a highly effective way of enhancing the absorption of international best -practice \\ntechnology, thus boosting productivity and output growth.  \\nThe review of East Asian countries trade and industrial policies indicates that most of the East Asia n \\ncountries began industrialization with a protectionist orientation and have  gradually moved toward \\nincreasingly free trade. Along the way, they often tapped some of the efficiency generating benefits of \\ninternational competition through mixed trade regim es: they granted exporters duty -free imports of capital \\nand intermediate goods while continuing to protect consumer goods. Since they had no control over export \\nprices which were set in the international market and were often substantially less than curren t marginal or \\naverage costs the strategy was to ensure that profits in the protected market offset losses on export \\nproduction. Nevertheless, export policies leveraged competition in the international market to ensure that 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.045.0\\nSingapore Hong Kong Korea, Rep.

Subsequently, all the high -performing East Asian countries \\nreduced their protection of import -substituting industries, thus virtually eliminating any remaining ant -\\nexport bias of policy. What is notable is that even during the hay days of  protection, effective rates of \\nprotection were much lower than what is in Bangladesh today.  \\nMost East Asian countries made export performance the standard by which all economic activity would be \\njudged. Even firms benefiting from higher than -average rate s of protection in the domestic market \\nunderstood that in the near future they would be forced to compete in world markets. Sustained reduction \\nin import protection sent a similar message to producers in the Southeast Asian newly industrializing \\neconomies.  Governments were credibly committed to export competition. Exports were important because \\nthey ensured that productivity growth would be facilitated by the improved ability to tap international \\nknowledge. Import substitution was quickly accompanied by the  promotion of exports and duty -free \\nadmission of imports for exporters. The result was limited differences between international relative prices \\nand domestic relative prices. Market forces and competitive pressures guided resources into activities that \\nwere consistent with comparative advantage and, in the case of labour -intensive exports, laid the foundation \\nfor learning international best practice and subsequent industrial upgrading. The experience of China and \\nVietnam is highlight below and in Figure 2.4 .  \\n2.3.1  China’s Strategy of Economic Development Post -1978  \\nFrom the position of a poverty r idden large society until the 1970s, the emergence of the Chinese economy \\nas a major global player within three decades of pro -market and pro -global reforms is the  most striking \\nexample of successful economic strategy in the 21st century so much so that it is being described as “the \\nworld’s factory” for creating the largest manufacturing hub in the world. This spectacular rise of China in \\nbecoming the top exporter o f the world perhaps belies the record of the East Asian Tigers and is worth a \\ncareful review by all developing economies aiming at growth acceleration and poverty reduction in the \\nshortest possible time. Bangladesh can surely attempt to take a leaf or two out of the Chinese book.  \\nAccording to the 2013 World Bank report, China 2030 - Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative \\nSociety , the key features of China’s development strategy post -1978 that produced export surge, rapid \\ngrowth and poverty reduction com prised the following:  \\n Pragmatic and effective market -oriented reforms : One key feature of these reforms was their “dual -track” \\nnature —supporting state -owned firms in old priority sectors while liberalizing the entry of private \\nenterprises.  \\nBalancing growt h with soc ial and macroeconomic stability:   The unstable economic situation that \\nprevailed prior to 1978 reform phase made economic growth an urgent priority.  A mix of fiscal, \\nadministrative, and employment policies helped to maintain social stability dur ing this period of rapid \\neconomic and structural change. The restructuring of SOEs created massive displacement of labour  that \\nhad to be rehabilitated in alternative employment.  \\nDomestic market integration:  Policies were undertaken to restrict the regiona l barriers to the movement of \\ngoods, labour , and capital and the establishment of a single national market. Infrastructure development \\nprojects to improve connectivity via roads and coasts were prioritized to help markets grow.    \\n \\n206 \\n Steady inte gration with the  global economy:   The establishment of special  economic zones and  accession \\ninto the World Trade Organization  (WTO) helped China expand its economic integration with the global \\neconomy.  \\nValue Chain Integration : The country evolved from a somewhat closed a nd guarded economy to a highly \\nintegrated manufacturing hub for the global value chains (GVCs) by implementing policies to attract \\nforeign investment and promote trade facilitation. Over the years, China invested heavily in transportation, \\ninternet, inform ation and communication technology (ICT) related infrastructure. Integration into GVCs \\nhelped improve firm productivity and competitiveness. As a result, today China is one of three main global \\nmanufacturing hubs; besides the US and Germany.  \\nAsian economi es are tightly linked with China through regional supply chains. McKinsey Global Institute \\nfinds that value chains are becoming more regional and less global. This development is particularly \\nnoticeable in Asia. China is the largest trading and investment partner of Malaysia, Singapore, and the \\nPhilippines. In recent years, China’s role in international trade has begun to shift. China is moving into \\nhigher value -added sections of the GVCs.  \\n2.3.2  Vietnam – Manufacturing Miracle  \\nWorldwide, one in 10 smartpho nes is produced in Vietnam today. Mobile phones are Vietnam’s number \\none export, generating export revenues of more than $50 billion  in 2019. Globally, Vietnam is among the \\nmost open economies with a trade -to-GDP ratio of 190 percent in 2018. Through the removal of both tariff \\nand non -tariff barriers and fulfilling its commitment in several regional and global trade agreements, the \\ncountry has made remarkable achievements in trade liberalization and integration with the largest trading \\nblocs in the world.  \\nThere is something unique about Vietnam’s development strategy. At a time when global trade has \\nstagnated, Vietnam’s trade has soared to 200 percent of GDP in 2018 from 70 percent in 2007. By \\nleveraging the world economy , Vietnam’s manufacturing sector has steadily expanded, adding an estimated \\n1.5 million new manufacturing jobs between 2014 and 2016 alone.  \\nManufacturing witnesses  a renaissance  in Vietnam, while relapsing in many parts of the world. Given the \\nrecent clarion call by several world leaders to create manufacturing jobs in their countries, Vietnam’s \\nexperience holds lessons for developing and advanced economies alike.  \\nVietnam succeed ed in sustaining strong export growth based on its strong foundations through good \\npolicies. First, it embraced trade liberalization with gusto. Second, it complemented external liberalization \\nwith domestic reforms through deregulation and lowering the cos t of doing business. Third, it welcomed \\nFDI with open arms without conditions or restrictions. Finally, Vietnam has invested heavily in human and \\nphysical capital, predominantly through public investments. These lessons —global integration, domestic \\nliberal ization, courting FDI, and investing in people and infrastructure – are worth emulating for developing \\ncountries.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n207 \\n Figure 2.4: Export Growth in China and Vietnam (1980 -2015)  \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank  \\nFirst, trade policy has  arguably been the most important industrial policy for Vietnam. With Singapore, it \\nshares the top spot in East Asia of being a member for bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. A \\nsignatory to 16 bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements,  Vietnam is a member of the World Trade  \\nOrganization, ASEAN, and has concluded bilateral agreements with the U.S.A, Japan, South Korea, the \\nEU, and the Eurasian Customs Union. Earlier this year, it became one of 11 countries to join the revived \\nCPTPP.  \\nThes e trade agreements dramatically reduced tariffs, anchored difficult domestic reforms, and opened much \\nof the economy to foreign investment. It is estimated  that more than 10,000 foreign companies —including \\nmajor global players such as Samsung, Intel, and L G—operate in Vietnam today, mostly in export -oriented, \\nlabour -intensive manufacturing.  \\nSecond, Vietnam has leveraged its demographic dividend through effective investment in its people. \\nVietnam’s efforts to promote access to primary education and to ensure  its quality through minimum quality \\nstandards have paid off.  \\nThird, focus on competitiveness and the ease of doing business. Vietnam has made steady progress in \\nimproving its investment climate, as evidenced by higher scores in the 2018 World Economic For um’s \\ncompetitiveness index (up five points to 55th in the world), and the 2018 World Bank’s ease of doing  \\nbusiness ranking (68th in the world, up 31 places since 2014). Vietnam also reduced the corporate income \\ntax rate to 20 percent from 32 percent in 200 3. \\nFinally, Vietnam invested in infrastructure, especially in the power sector and connectivity. Thanks in part \\nto high public investment, power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity have been scaled up \\nto meet rapidly rising  demand.  \\nOverall , Vietnam’s manufacturing sector remains relatively small. Most of the sector is driven by foreign \\ndirect investment (FDI), which accounts for close to 90 percent of manufacturing exports. Many of the \\nnewly created jobs in manufacturing are in basic assemb ly which requires manual labour  but does not 17.60 17.51 17.66\\n7.1226.36\\n17.28\\n0.005.0010.0015.0020.0025.0030.00\\n1980-1989 1990-1999 2000-2015China Vietnam  \\n \\n208 \\n necessarily add a lot of value (per worker). Moreover, as wages inevitably rise, Vietnam’s current \\ncomparative advantage in low -skill, labour -intensive industries  will start to dissipate, a trend that may be \\namplified by new labour -saving technologies and automation. Vietnam’s recent ascension to the ranks of \\nglobal manufacturing hubs offers lessons on the potential of export - and manufacturing -led growth.  \\nThe take away : When it comes to trade and industrial poli cy the high -performing economies of East Asia \\nincluding China left an indelible mark on development policies pursued until the present day. Vietnam, a \\nlatecomer, has taken export orientation to the extreme with its export -GDP ratio now crossing 100% and \\nits trade -GDP ratio approaching 200%. What is common in the development strategies of all these \\neconomies is the leveraging of global markets through greater trade integration to provide impetus to \\nindustrialization and massive job creation at home. One comm on strategy across all East Asian Tiger \\neconomies was to ensure that, on balance, incentives to export production remained above those designed \\nfor production for the domestic market. This is contrary to the orthodox prescription of maintaining neutral \\nincentives between the two markets. Industrial protection existed but was never high enough to undermine \\nexport incentives or create significant anti -export bias. In the case of industrial policy, “selective \\nindustrialization with significant government inter vention” approach taken by Korea (heavy and chemical \\nindustries), Taiwan, and Malaysia, did not produce intended results and were ultimately abandoned by all. \\nDeparture from the age -old strategy of import -substituting industrialization (ISI) to export -led \\nindustrialization was clearly the predominant strategy. With the rise in global value chain integration and \\nthe explosion of trade in parts and components Vietnam brought in the added approach of FDI -led \\ninvestment and export orientation so much so that in  2018, 90% of Vietnam’s manufacturing exports were \\ndriven by FDI. All three lessons – incentives favouring  export production over import substitution, the \\nparadigm of export -led growth, and FDI -driven manufacturing exports – are worth drawing from in \\narticulating a medium - to long -term development strategy for Bangladesh.  \\nFinally, it is important to reflect on the limited but effective role state intervention played in these \\neconomies. Markets are powerful forces but they are not perfect; institutions are needed to make them work \\nefficiently and Government interventions are needed to improve on market outcomes. I n their approach to \\ndevelopment, there was always a supportive though a market -facilitating role for the state with the pivotal \\nresponsibility of p roviding a stable macro -economy with clear rules of the game, opening the economy \\nfully to international product and factor flows, giving the lead role to private enterprise, and furnishing \\nessential public goods like basic huma n capital and infrastructure .  \\n2.4 8FYP TRADE POLICIES FOR MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT  \\nIn the globalized world of today, trade policies are recognized as the major instruments for industrial \\ndevelopment. In fact, industrial and trade policies are often two sides of the same coin. Broadly defined, \\nindustrial strategies are of two kinds: export -oriented industrialization and import -substituting \\nindustrialization, depending on which market – foreign or domestic – is the preferred destination of \\nproduction. Trade policy is the major instrument  used in steering the direction of industrial development \\ntowards foreign and/or domestic markets.  \\nFor much of the next quarter -century, the bulk of job creation in Bangladesh will be taking place in a \\ndiversified manufacturing sector that is globally com petitive, export -oriented, and focused on breaking into \\nemerging markets while expanding its market share in developed economies of the world. The   \\n \\n209 \\n Government’s Sixth and Seventh Five Year Plans, the Perspective Plan 2010 -21 and the Perspective Plan \\n2041 al ready laid out the blueprint for trade and industrial policies for growth acceleration through outward - \\norientated trade policy regime. The strategies for outward -orientation of trade policies in order to ensure \\nexport -led or trade -led growth will have to be activated in full during the 8FYP. However, the reform \\nagenda in this area remains unfinished and more will have to be done particularly as we approach the stage \\nof graduation out of LDC status in 2024. Policies have to be put in place that ensures CAF -based export \\ncompetitiveness on the one hand, and restores the balance of incentives between production for exports and \\nimport substitute production for sale in the domestic market on the other. There is little doubt that \\n“preference erosion” in the post -graduation scenario is expected to unleash the strongest forces of \\ncompetitiveness in the global market. That calls for stronger measures to raise productivity, efficiency, and \\ncompetitiveness of Bangladeshi products – mostly manufacturing, but agro -process ed (e.g. jute goods) and \\nagricultural products could be no less competitive.  \\nTrade Policy Strategy for Industrialization and Growth  \\nOnce the world economy has gone past the COVID -19 pandemic Bangladesh’s future industrial prospects \\nwill be intricately lin ked to the projected trends in (a) global and regional trade in a highly competitive \\nenvironment, (b) the future of globalization, and (c) the evolution of trade policies determined by the \\ntransformation of manufacturing and services of the future, during the 8FYP  which is also a preparatory \\nperiod of LDC graduation, it is imperative to develop an integrated strategy for future growth and job \\ncreation for Bangladesh building on the interplay of these three interlinked and strategic forces that can fuel \\neconomic growth and propel Bangladesh comfortably across the finishing line of LDC graduation that also \\nstraddles the end -year of the 8FYP.  \\nFocus and principles of industrial policy : Structural change in Bangladesh has been consistent with the \\nstylized facts of growth – where the share of industry in GDP rises at the expense of agriculture. Sound \\nindustrial  policy is needed to make industrialization work for job creation and growth. Industrial policy \\nhas worked in countries such as Singapore, Ireland, Taiwan, Malaysia and S. Korea, who managed to \\ndirect the market into sectors using clustering and targeted technology complemented with human \\nresource development. Over time, a more pragmatic view about the effectiveness of industrial policy is \\nemerging: industria l policy is important in theory and practice and it is possible to identify a set of design \\nprinciples behind effective industrial policy. Bangladesh does commit to an industrial policy periodically, \\nso it is important that we should examine what makes goo d industrial policy that helps to promote growth \\nand productivity change.  \\nTo sustain and boost industrial dynamism during the 8FYP, a two -pronged approach is needed and it is \\nbroadly on track though some shortcomings remain:  \\na. Growth acceleration will be dri ven by export -oriented industrialization  along with promoting the \\ndomestic market demand  that is globally competitive and based on the country\\'s dynamic comparative \\nadvantage, such that industrialization is employment -intensive with evolving skill -intensit y consistent \\nwith technological sophistication of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4) thus paving the way \\nfor greater export diversification  and domestic market expansion based on competitiveness . \\nRecognizing that export and protection policies a re not mutually exclusive, the objective will be to \\nstrike a harmonious balance between the two policies by modernizing and rationalizing export   \\n \\n210 \\n incentives and protective tariffs in addition to completing the unfinished trade reform agenda with \\nemphasis on  the trade facilitation component of customs administration modernization.  \\n \\nb. Private sector will remain the driver of growth  and, to this end, creating an investment -friendly \\nenvironment by transforming the state’s role as a facilitator of economic and inv estment activities, \\nstrengthening economic and political governance, including the interaction of the state with the private \\nsector; improving law and order; addressing  the critically constraining infrastructure bottlenecks (in \\npower, overland and port tr ansport, and communications); establishing a sound and well -functioning \\nfinancial sector; and addressing other barriers to productivity growth and international competitiveness.  \\n \\nWith growth acceleration for faster poverty reduction as the desired goal, Ba ngladesh’s private sector \\ncomplemented by facilitating state apparatus will have to pursue the following strategies in a world market \\nthat will get more competitive by the day:  \\nSeek global markets : We are living in  a world that is transforming at speeds al most incomprehensible to \\nthe average mind. Unlike historical growth rates experienced in the past centuries, it is now possible for \\ndeveloping economies like Bangladesh to grow at 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent annually.  This is because of the \\nenabling effect of a rapidly integrating global economy. The global economy provides two things. One is a \\nhuge market which is getting more integrated over time. Provided an economy has some competitive edge \\n– and Bangladesh does -- it can basically grow as fast as it can in vest and build productive capacity. The \\nsecond thing — even more important —is that the global economy provides knowledge, technology, know -\\nhow. Globalization coupled with the instantaneous transmission of digitized information results in \\nacceleration and au gmentation of the flow of knowledge, technology, and learning. Properly harnessing these \\nglobal forces will enable Bangladesh to grow at higher a rate in future that was  simply not possible before.   \\nGiven Bangladesh’s enormous challenge for creating roughl y 2 million jobs annually, there is no option \\nbut to creating bridgeheads in the global market for our exports. Given the small size of its domestic \\neconomy, Bangladesh needs to expand its exports of goods and services in order to move to a higher growth \\npath and grow out of poverty. The domestic market, despite its continual expansion, is still no match for \\nthe vast global market place of $80 trillion Capturing pieces of that market, beyond EU and North America, \\ninto China, India, and the Asia Pacific regi on to top $100 billion  of exports by 2025 will have to be the \\ntarget to reach.  \\nEnhance productivity : Over the next five years or so Bangladesh must be ready to face unbridled \\ncompetition in the global marketplace as significant “preference erosion” will ha ve taken place by then. In \\nthe new competitive environment, the key challenge for us will be to raise \\'productivity\\' of our firms and \\nindustries/sectors within the framework of sound macroeconomic management . Bangladesh has roughly \\nfive years to climb appr eciably up the ladder of World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EDB 2019) where \\nit is behind most of the comparators. Economic governance and regulatory environment have to be \\nconducive for business and investment -with well -functioning factor markets, effici ently run infrastructure \\nservices, easy market entry/exit, enabling regulatory environment and bureaucracy, access to information, \\nand strong competitive pressures --would allow firms to become more productive, competitive, dynamic, \\nand innovative. Such an environment accentuates competitiveness of exporting firms. It extends beyond \\ncomparative advantage (based on cheap labour ) and shifts to competing on the basis of competitive \\nadvantages. Keeping this in mind , “Bangladesh National Productivity Master plan FY2021 - FY2030”   \\n \\n211 \\n prepared by National Productivity  Organization under Ministry of Industry needs to be implemented. \\nConsidering the importance of productivity Government has declared to observe the 2nd October as the \\nNational Productivity  Day every year.   \\nStrive for diversification and competitiveness : This is what Bangladesh needs to strive for in the coming \\nyears for promoting export diversification and competitiveness. Given that there is a significant backlog of \\nincomplete reforms, there is indeed an urg ency to act fast in addressing the priority policy and institutional \\nconstraints to improving Bangladesh\\'s competitiveness. First, global markets are undergoing rapid \\ntechnological transformation and trade integration with mooting competitive pressures. Th ere is no option \\nfor Bangladesh but to strengthen its competitiveness and diversify its export in order to improve our export \\nperformance to engender faster growth. Second, though Bangladesh has become a global player in RMG it \\nhas to be ready to cope with  stiffer competition once it loses preferential access to its leading export market \\n– the EU. The RMG industry has indeed matured with some of the world’s greenest factories (top 3 eco -\\nfriendly and 7 of the top 10 garment factories in the world are in Bang ladesh). Nevertheless, the industry \\nmust remain on the alert to keep in step with technological innovations taking place that could undermine \\nBangladesh’s competitive edge unless all efforts are made to at least march in step with the industry leaders \\naround the world. Finally, the potential for export diversification needs to be fully exploited. Bangladesh \\nhas a mono -product export basket with 83% of her exports made up of RMG. Yet, over the past 10 years, \\nBangladesh has been exporting non -RMG goods number ing 1000 to 1300 products (at HS6 -code level) \\nmostly under $1 million in value (75% of non -RMG exports in FY2018).  \\nWith LDC graduation looming large, the severest degree of competition will be unleashed over the next 5 \\nto 10 years. Preparation for that sta ge must be done in earnest now. Given the current state of trade \\norientation, there are two areas in which the country faces serious challenges: (a) making trade policy – \\ninternal and external – tilted in favour  of exports, and (b) addressing the plethora of behind -the-border \\nobstacles or deficiencies in order to make exports diversified and competitive in the world market based on \\nour comparative advantage. Efforts made towards enhancing international competitiveness and removing \\nanti-export bias will even tually pay off. It is therefore critical that concerted effort is made to improve \\nBangladesh\\'s competitiveness by addressing both behind -the-border constraints as well as the remaining \\nsignificant external trade agenda.  \\n2.5 CURRENT TRADE REGIME AND EXPORT PERF ORMANCE  \\nThe trade policy reforms of the 1990s signalled  a significant departure from the highly protectionist, \\ninward -oriented import -substitution policies of the past, some of which were clearly CAD -based (e.g. \\nmachine tool and some chemical industries).  Trade integration was enhanced along with greater domestic \\ncompetition, and domestic relative prices were aligned closer to international prices. These reforms were \\nmeant to promote efficiency in resource use, lead to productivity growth, spur activities w ith comparative \\nadvantage, encourage technological progress and diffusion and thus generate dynamic gains. The trade \\npolicy measures included tariff cuts and rationalization, elimination of quantitative restrictions, adoption of \\na unified exchange rate sys tem, switching from a fixed to a more flexible exchange rate regime, and current \\naccount convertibility. The expectation was that these reforms would be gradually intensified to make \\nBangladesh a CAF -based export powerhouse in the region with the economy m ore open and fully integrated \\nwith the global market.    \\n \\n212 \\n Progress in the accentuation of trade liberalization has not been as deep and comprehensive as was needed \\nto give sustainable impetus to Bangladesh’s export performance. But with LDC graduation looming  large \\nBangladesh can ill afford to remain complacent. Unless trade policy reforms are taken to the next phase, \\nLDC graduation in 2024 could serve as an adverse shock to the economy. The plan is to move this agenda \\nforward and be fully prepared to face any  adverse developments in the global marketplace.   \\nDespite considerable progress in the past decade, the current trade regime appears  yet biased in favour  of \\nimport substitute production  Slower tariff reduction  and phase by phase elimination of other prote ctive \\ninstruments that protect domestic industries create some disincentives to exports and export activities \\nthrough several channels. It has taken time to recognize that tax and incentive policies have created a \\nsituation where production for export is l ess incentivized than production for the domestic market.   \\n\\uf0b7 Almost all domestic production of manufactured consumer goods is protected by tariffs and Para-tariffs. \\nDuties levied on imports of final goods raise their domestic relative prices, thereby increas ing the \\nprofitability of import substitutes relative to exports, which have to be exported at world prices. This \\ndiverts resources towards production for the domestic market, away from the production of exports. \\nFor example, the very high protection (85.6 percent to 113 percent) afforded to the ceramics, plastics, \\nand biscuits industry —tableware, kitchenware; footwear, lamps, etc. which, to some degree, are \\nreflected in much higher domestic prices of these products compared to their export prices. The net \\nresult is that domestic sales are far more profitable than exports, so exports are discouraged. Almost all \\nof these products have some exports but export potential, which is much higher, is never realized.  \\n\\uf0b7 With import demand being curtailed under high prot ection, import -related (ex -ante) demand for foreign \\nexchange is being curtailed, thus perhaps enabling the exchange rate to be lower than otherwise (i.e., a \\nlower domestic currency price for US$). This would mean that export proceeds, expressed in domestic  \\ncurrency, would be lower than what the exporter would receive. Thus, the exchange rate becomes over -\\nvalued as a result of protection making exports less competitive.  \\n\\uf0b7 Not just tariff levels, tariff escalation is also high. An escalating tariff structure, with lower tariffs on \\nimports of raw materials and intermediates and higher tariffs on more processed products, raises the \\neffective protection for an import substitute above the nominal protection that the same import substitute \\nreceives from import dutie s and other protection. This means that the value -added (processing margins) \\ninvolved in production for the domestic market will exceed the value -added that would have existed in \\nthe absence of any protection, by proportionately more than the nominal prote ction of the final product. \\nThis further increases the anti -export  bias. Research shows that the rates of tariff escalation in \\nBangladesh’s tariff structure are among the highest in the world.   \\n\\uf0b7 Exporters sell in competitive world markets and cannot pass o n increases in their costs of production \\nto their buyers. Thus, import duties paid on imported inputs increase their production costs and reduce \\ntheir profit margins. Similarly, if they buy their inputs from local producers, again there may be cost \\nraising  effects due to protection and/or lack of local  competition.  \\n\\uf0b7 To counter the effects of tariffs on inputs and ensure supply of inputs at international prices, the \\nGovernment has put in place two mechanisms: (a) The special bonded -warehouse (SBW) scheme use d \\nlargely by the RMG sector and occasionally by others, and (b) the Duty Exemption and Drawback \\n(DEDO) scheme, both managed by the Customs department. The SBW, which allows duty -free import \\nof inputs, is far more effective in a high tariff economy and NBR is working to extend the facility to   \\n \\n213 \\n other exporters as well. DEDO, which involves reimbursement of tariffs already paid on inputs, has \\nproved dysfunctional and cannot be relied on to make exports competitive.  \\nAnti-export bias remains high. Research  shows  that high tariff protection is the main source of anti -export \\nbias. Export success so far has been limited to readymade garments (RMG) without much traction in other \\nlabour -intensive exports. Among other things, there is an inherent conflict between expor t policy and \\nprotection policy, which are not mutually exclusive. This needs to be recognized and actions need to be \\ntaken to streamline these policies. Table 2.4 shows Bangladesh’s low ranking in reducing high trade tariff. \\nHigh tariffs raise the relative  profitability of domestic sales compared to exports, thus discouraging \\nproduction for exports. Thus, there is an inherent bias of incentives skewed in favour  of import substitute \\nproduction rather than exports. This has to change.  \\nTable 2.4: Bangladesh R ank, Average Tariff  Ranking of Bangladesh in Relation to  \\nOther Developing Countries 2018  (Rank higher for lower tariff)  \\nCOUNTRIES  ALL PRODUCTS (IN ASI A) MANUFACTURING (IN WO RLD)  \\nBANGLADESH  4 19 \\nINDIA  10 74 \\nPAKISTAN  5 25 \\nSRI LANKA  12 82 \\nVIETNAM  16 90 \\nMALAYSIA  22 102 \\nTHAILAND  14 84 \\nNote: All products tariff rankings are based on Asian countries (46 countries); Tariff ranking in manufacturing is based on \\nworld ranking of tariffs (182 countries); Ranks higher for lower tariffs  \\nSource: ITC database, In dexmundi trade statistics , 2017 -2018  \\nTables 2.5 -2.7 show that our tariffs compare unfavourably  with the average rates for different country \\ngroups based on various standard classification criteria.  \\nTable 2.5: Average Tariff Rates by WB Country Classificat ions \\nCountry Categories  Average Tariff Rate (%)  \\nLow -Income Countries  11.0 \\nLower Middle -Income Countries  7.2 \\nUpper Middle -Income Countries  3.7 \\nHigh -Income Countries  2.0 \\nSource: World Bank Tariff Tables , 2018  \\nTable 2.6: Average Tariff Rates of Countries  by UN Classification  \\nUN country classification  Average tariff  Minimum  Maximum  \\nDeveloped/ OECD Countries  2.06 0.2 (Iceland)  5.8 (Chile)  \\nDeveloping Countries  6.53 1.1 (Turkmenistan)  25.7 (Bahamas)  \\nLeast Developed Countries  8.41 3.4 (Bhutan)  19.6 (Djibout i) \\nSource: Compiled from UN country classifications (2014) & World Bank tariff data , 2018  \\n    \\n \\n214 \\n Table 2.7: Simple Average MFN Applied Tariffs of Selected Comparator Countries  \\nCountry  Average tariff  \\nBangladesh  13.5*  \\nVietnam  9.5  \\nThailand  9.6  \\nMalaysia  5.6  \\nPhilippines  6.2  \\nIndonesia  8.1  \\nIndia  17.1  \\nSri Lanka  \\nChina  9.3 \\nSource: World Tariff Profiles 2019, World Trade Organization, ITC 2019 and UNCTAD 2019;  \\n(*) Average CD only, excludes para -tariffs of another 13%.  \\nIn conclusion, though Bangladesh’s exp ort performance was boosted by the trade liberalization program of \\nthe 1990s clocking double -digit growth for a quarter -century, by the end of 6FYP export growth faltered \\nowing to renewed trade protection and exchange rate over -valuation (Figure 2.5). This  situation needs to \\nbe reversed with a concerted effort – a combination of trade and industrial policies and competitive \\nexchange rate – to regain the export momentum of the past. Policies and actions need to be directed towards \\nexploiting the latent poten tial in our exports beyond the RMG sector without losing continued momentum \\nin RMG exports of course.  \\nFigure 2.5: Disaggregated Export Performance (Average annual growth rate %)  \\n \\n              Source: Export Promotion Bureau , Various Years  \\n2.6 IMPLEMENTING A  TRADE REGIME FOR HIGHER EXPORTS AND \\nDIVERSIFICATION  \\nHaving established that the two inter -linked policies  of rationalizing the protection structure and sufficiently \\nincentivizing exports needs immediate attention, the 8 FYP articulates the required strate gy.

So, there is no option but to \\nrationalize the level and structure of protection to import substitute industries in  order to minimize the level \\nof anti -export bias.  \\nThe Im perative of Tariff Modernis ation : Streamlining trade and tariff policies calls for a five -year program \\nof adjustment culminating in a trade and tariff regime that is reflective of or trending towards  a UMIC \\neconomy, a goal that is set for 2031 in the Bangladesh Perspective Plan 2021 -41. Needless to say, that the \\ncurrent tariff regime, which is replete with para -tariffs for protection purposes and the near absence of tariff \\nbindings on manufacturing pr oducts, will have to change after LDC graduation . Both external (opening \\nmarkets by seizing opportunities of bilateral, regional and plurilateral agreements) and domestic content \\n(eliminating anti -export bias by balancing incentives for exports and domesti c sales) of trade policy will \\nhave to be revamped to fit the demands of a dynamic global market and an export -oriented trading regime, \\nnot to mention the impending structural adjustments that might be unleashed into the manufacturing and \\nservice sector  by the on-going  4IR.  \\nThe current tariff structure is archaic and needs urgent reforms. One required priority action is the further \\nrationalization and modernization of the tariff regime.  A close examination of the structure of tariffs reveals \\nthat the decli ne in average nominal protection rate (NPR) was due primarily to the reduction in tariffs on \\nbasic raw materials, capital goods and intermediate inputs, while the top CD rate remained flat at 25% since \\nFY05, topped up by generous supplement of levies such as supplementary duty (SD) and regulatory duty \\n(RD) – para-tariffs. The trends in nominal protection rates of import categories reveals that in the recent \\npast the average NPR for input categories have been declining rapidly while that of final consumer go ods \\nremained practically flat if not increased. The wedge between output and input tariffs has become unusually \\nlarge, unlike that in any other country (Figure 2.6 and Table 2.8). What is seldom recognized is that this \\ntrend of input and output tariffs is unique for Bangladesh and deviates far from the pattern followed by the \\nhigh-performing economies in East Asia and other comparator countries. Two things to be noted: while the \\ndivergence between input and output tariffs (tariff escalation ratio) in compar ator countries is low and over \\ntime both input and output tariffs trend downwards, Bangladesh tariffs have not followed this trend. Instead, \\noutput tariffs have risen while inputs tariffs declined over time. It is also necessary to adjust the tax regime \\nto shift the focus from indirect tax to direct tax for revenue collection sources.  \\nTable 2.8: Tariff Escalation Ratios of Bangladesh and Selected Countries/Regions  \\nCountry/Region  Year  Average Input Tariff  Average Output Tariff  Tariff Escalation Ratio  \\nBangla desh  2018  13.13  45.98  3.50 \\nChina  2016  8.33 13.41  1.61 \\nIndia  2016  11.69  14.99  1.28 \\nIndonesia  2013  5.28 9.20 1.74 \\nSouth Korea  2015  13.24  12.06  0.91 \\nMalaysia  2014  3.69 7.53 2.04 \\nPhilippines  2015  5.01 9.82 1.96 \\nThailand  2015  7.92 18.59  2.35 \\nVietnam  2016 6.41 17.59  2.74 \\nTurkey  2016  7.69 10.58  1.38 \\nSouth Asia  2016  10.66  16.00  1.50 \\nASEAN  2016  3.65 7.27 1.99 \\nSource:  NBR; WITS Database, World Bank     \\n \\n216 \\n Figure 2.6: Trends in Output and Input Tariffs:  \\nBangladesh, India, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\nSource: NBR, TRAINS Database, WITS  Various Years  Average Input \\nTariff17.8 14.6 12.2 12.813.1Average Output \\nTariff 37.434.247.347.846.0\\n0102030405060\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018Tariff Rate (%)Bangladesh\\nInputs Consumer Goods\\nAverage \\nInput …\\n11.80 11.41 11.69Average \\nOutput \\nTariff\\n17.74 14.66 14.99\\n0.005.0010.0015.0020.0025.0030.0035.0040.00Tariff Rate (%)India\\nInputs Consumer GoodsAverage \\nInput Tariff \\n10.810.9\\n6.26.4Average \\nOutput \\nTariff30.0\\n30.4\\n17.417.6\\n0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.0Tariff Rate (%)Vietnam\\nInputs Consumer Goods\\nAverage \\nInput Tariff \\n4.03 4.133.52Average \\nOutput \\nTariff \\n11.7\\n7.45\\n5.71\\n0.002.004.006.008.0010.0012.0014.0016.00\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2016Tariff Rate (%)Malaysia\\nInputs Consumer GoodsAverage \\nInput Tariff12.4\\n7.4 7.9Average \\nOutput \\nTariff\\n25.0\\n18.318.6\\n0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0\\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Tariff Rate (%)Thailand\\nInputs Consumer Goods  \\n \\n217 \\n The gaping wedge between the two averages – of input and output tariffs – lasted all through the 6th and \\n7FYP  (Table 2.9).

Export diversification matters because \\nit lowers volatility and instability in export earnings. The Government believes that the strategy of export \\ndiversification cannot be limited to product diversification in the export basket. Rathe r, the strategy must \\nembrace many different facets, each of which addresses the vulnerability aspect of export concentration, as \\nsummarized below:  \\n\\uf0b7 Product diversification – introducing a range of new products in the export basket.  \\n\\uf0b7 Geographical diversific ation – widening the range of destination markets for exports.  \\n\\uf0b7 Quality diversification – upgrading the value of existing products, i.e. moving up market from \\nlow end to high -end products.  \\n\\uf0b7 Goods -to-services diversification – seeking opportunities to expan d non -merchandise exports.  \\n\\uf0b7 Intermediate goods diversification – product diversification need not imply adding only final \\nconsumer goods in the export basket.  \\nNevertheless, product diversification is the immediate and major challenge. Export concentration  in \\nreadymade garments, which now accounts for 84% of our export earning,  makes the economy, jobs and \\nincome, extremely vulnerable to external shocks arising from changes in global demand for RMG. While \\nBangladesh’s export growth for the last decade and a half could be characterized as robust, a sudden decline \\nin demand for Bangladeshi RMG would send shock waves throughout the economy. Such a prospect can \\nbe avoided through the creation of a diversified export basket. Some important non -traditional exports like \\nfootwear and leather products, light engineering products (bicycle and electronics), pharmaceuticals, \\nceramics, jute goods, ocean -going ships, and numerous labour -intensive products have the potential to \\ngrow. Thus, product diversification is a key ob jective underlying the strategy for manufacturing growth.  \\nTo gain traction on export product diversification the Ministry of Commerce recognizes the importance of \\nfocusing on three aspects of the trade policy regime:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring export competitiveness – by addressing barriers (e.g. tariffs, trade infrastructure, \\nenergy and telecommunications, regulations, finance, etc.).  \\n\\uf0b7 Strategy for reducing anti -export bias of the trade regime.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strategy for reducing anti -diversification bias of exports.  \\nThe export -led gro wth philosophy underscores the need for setting up an incentive structure that overcomes \\nthe problem of serious policy -induced anti -export bias. The principal route to this ‘ biases  or discrimination \\nis accomplished by altering relative prices of exports an d domestic sales. While for exporters it is not \\npossible to influence the world price, import tariffs and quantitative restrictions allow the producers to raise \\nthe domestic price of their commodities above the world price. The resultant profitability (and  thus \\nrelatively high price of import substitutes to export goods) under the shield of protective measures \\nencourages reallocation of resources from the production of exportable to that of import substitutes. Also, \\npolicy -induced domestic production may re sult in increased demand for non -tradable diverting further \\nresources into this sector at the cost of exportable.  \\nThe RMG sector escaped this anti -export through the government’s creation of a “free trade channel” for \\nthis 100% export -oriented sector with in an otherwise high tariff regime. Aided by the MFA which gave \\naccess to world markets, domestic policies designed exclusively for RMG industry, comprising special \\nbonded warehouse and back -to-back LC, were able to soundly neutralize anti -export bias of a  high tariff \\nregime. Replicating these policies for non -RMG exports is the way to go as long as high tariff protection \\nprevails.    \\n \\n219 \\n At around the end of the 7FYP (FY19), Bangladesh exported some 1400 non -RMG exports (at HS -6 digits) \\nbut only a handful reache d the volume of $1 billion (e.g. jute and jute goods, footwear and leather goods, \\nhome textiles, etc.), though this picture would be different if we include “deemed exports” (backward \\nlinkage industries to RMG) where fabrics, yarn and accessories supplies now account for over 60% of RMG \\nexports of $34 billion in FY2019. This is part of the export diversification to be reckoned with. As for other \\nnon-RMG exports, the fact that exporting firms (estimated at about 3500) have a choice between producing \\nfor expo rts or the domestic market and find the latter to be far more profitable (i.e. anti -export bias), the \\nincentive to export looks feeble, with the consequence that both the firms and their exports remain small in \\nsize (barely 300 non -RMG products exceed $1 m illion). The critical step needed to break ground on export \\ndiversification and to get traction under these policy circumstances is to rationalize the tariff and protection \\nstructure to change the current policy tilt in favour  of import substitute producti on. This is the necessary \\ncondition for getting progress in export diversification that has been elusive so far.   \\nGoing forward, other aspects of efficiency and transparency will have to be added to customs administration \\nwhich, by 2025, will no longer ha ve a major role in revenue collection because domestic taxes (income tax \\nand VAT) will become the principal revenue instruments. Trade facilitation will be the underlying principle \\nof its existence. Still, protection of specific products through the applic ation of tariff peaks (a high tariff \\nrate) might emerge from time and time and exceptions to the uniform tariff rule would then have to be made \\nas temporary measures. Such a tariff structure will impart minimal distortion to domestic production and \\ntrade. Our trade regime must be so formulated as to enable a modern high -tech industrial sector of the future \\nto function with seamless movement of goods and services across borders or via online with least \\ntransaction costs.  \\nNew directions in trade policy : Some new thinking and new directions in trade policy orientation, with \\nsignificant departures from past approaches have become the national imperative for successful export -\\npush policies for industrialization in the post -LDC period.  These are:  \\n(a) New approach to protection policy : High protection for a long period creates inefficiency and \\nundermines competitiveness over the long -term. Consider reviewing protection policy, scale down \\nthe level of protection, and institute a mechanism of time -bound protection for im port-substitutes.  \\n \\n(b) Tariff rationalization : Bangladesh tariffs, nominal and effective protection levels are among the \\nhighest in the world. In addition, tariff escalation, and the spread between NPR on output and inputs \\nis too high. Recognizing that a high tariff regime undermines export competitiveness, it is time to \\nseriously start scaling back NPR on domestically produced final consumer goods. NBR must adopt \\na strategy of lowering average NPRs by 3 -5 percentage points every year until 2025, largely by \\nreducing NPR on import -substitute consumer goods.  \\n \\n(c) Access to world -price (duty -free) inputs must be ensured to all exports : The spectacular success of \\nRMG industry has not been replicated. A major reason for this is the existence of anti -export bias \\nin non -RMG export production. To replicate RMG success in other labour -intensive production, \\nthe facility of duty -free imported inputs must be provided even to firms that export part of their \\ntotal production. The policy for providing duty -free inputs for export p roduction is not a privilege \\n(or support) but a requirement for all export production in order to be on a level playing field with \\nglobal competitors who have access to world -priced inputs. Export success calls for a policy \\nenvironment with no anti -export bias.    \\n \\n220 \\n  \\n(d) Intermediate goods sector needs a boost : 98% of Bangladesh’s exports are final consumer products \\nwith little or no intermediate goods. As high protection is provided to mostly consumer goods, trade \\nand domestic policies have an anti -intermediate go ods bias. This needs to change as trade in \\nintermediate goods is the fastest component of global trade. Bangladesh needs to exploit the \\nopportunities created by cross -border production networks to produce and export intermediate \\ngoods that could be assembl ed elsewhere.  \\n \\n(e) Access to long -term and short -term financin g: It must be made available to both large and small \\nexporters in a country where large numbers of small exporters are unable to scale up their export \\nactivities due to various constraints.   \\n \\n(f) Forei gn direct investment (FDI): Partnership with good international investors that can support \\ntechnology transfer, create market access abroad and jobs at home  can be the ultimate boost for \\ndiversification of our exports. Most important for the next decade, F DI can help bridge the \\ntechnology gap and make Bangladesh manufacturing catch up with the latest advancement in global \\nmanufacturing.  \\n \\n(g) Government support to open external markets:  As trade preferences get phased out over the 5 -10 \\nyears in developed market s, government assistance and support through embassies become even \\nmore critical for successful market penetration in the largest global markets, such as EU, North \\nAmerica, Japan, and emerging economies.  \\n \\n(h) Policy flexibility helps : Not all good policies alw ays produce their intended outcome. Experience \\nof successful export economies shows how flexibility in policy implementation averts crisis. When \\na policy does not yield results there should be scope for changing directions.  \\n \\n(i) Trade Agreements with Regional Communities : Barring the USA, the vast majority of WTO \\nmember countries would like to see a reformed and more effective multilateral trading system. \\nBangladesh, which has benefited from the multilateral regime as an LDC, may use the special \\ndispensation fo r LDCs for the remaining years (until 2024) but will have to prepare for the stiffer \\ncompetition our firms will face in the global market, once the preferential access provision \\nevaporates following graduation. Furthermore, it must seek market access under  various bilateral \\nand regional trade and investment agreements. Markets in Asia are growing faster than any other \\nregion of the world and ADB projects that by 2050 50% of global GDP will be in Asia. Two \\nregional trading arrangements that hold tremendous p otential for trade and investment are RCEP \\n(ASEAN+) and CPTPP which together will constitute the bulk of the Asian market of the future. \\nBangladesh would be well advised to reach trading arrangements with these groupings. But that \\ncould be an uphill task g iven the current high tariff regime in Bangladesh and the enormous \\nresistance from domestic import substitution industries to any reduction of protective tariffs. The \\npolitical economy challenge is considerable but a breakthrough is essential in this area.    \\nBehind -the-Border Issues for Export Competitiveness : For effective export promotion, in addition to the \\nexport policies, a set of other complementary policies and programmes  are critically required. Stabilities of \\nthe macroeconomic environment, effectiv eness of the export promoting and supporting institutions, and \\nsmooth functioning of the financial markets are necessities. Furthermore, the quality of governance should \\nbe improved through promoting transparency and accountability, and by reducing the ext ent of corruption. \\nThe government should also take an effective role in technology diffusion and in providing appropriate \\nphysical infrastructural facilities.    \\n \\n221 \\n Streamlining and mainstreaming trade policies over the next five years or so will be the most imp ortant \\npolicy challenge to deal with. Then, there is the burning issue of ensuring competitiveness in a dynamic \\nglobal marketplace. The competitiveness agenda is getting increasingly more challenging in the era of 4IR \\nand the associated technology revoluti on, and automation. Trade preferences and trade concessions seek to \\ncompensate for some of the inherent vulnerabilities of LDCs. These vulnerabilities often include the high \\ncost of production owing to infrastructure constraints and other domestic policy -induced rigidities. Indeed, \\nglobal evidence shows that high trade logistic cost often imposes a higher cost disadvantage than trade taxes \\nin developing countries. Evidence from Bangladesh also shows that there are many behind -the-border \\nconstraints that inc rease the cost of production and trading across borders thus undermining export \\ncompetitiveness.   \\n2.6.1  Improving Trade Logistics  \\nExport competitiveness can be adversely affected by the high cost of trading, both for imports of raw \\nmaterials and capital g oods and exports of products. Bangladesh has gradually opened its economy to \\ninternational trade.  Domestic production and investment are now heavily reliant on imported inputs.  \\nImports as a share of GDP amounted to  18.5% in FY2019 . Exports have also grow n and are now about \\n14% of GDP. Financial cost of trading (transport, insurance, and handling ) and the efficiency of port \\nclearances can both have determining influence on competitiveness.   \\nRecognizing the importance of trade logistics, the World Bank com piles and regularly updates index of \\ntrade logistics performance (LPI) and ranks countries based on the LPI scores.  The 2018 LPI rankings for \\nBangladesh and comparators are indicated in Figure 2.8.  Bangladesh is ranked at 100 out of 160 countries.  \\nThe L PI ranking is very low relative to China, Thailand, India and Vietnam. For example, China, India and \\nVietnam are major Bangladesh competitors for RMG in the EU market and the higher cost of trade logistics \\nmay have serious adverse consequences for maintain ing ma rket share post -LDC graduation. So, paying \\nattention to improve  trade logistics performance gains added significance in a post -graduation environment. \\nBangladesh must improve the LPI rankings.  \\nFigure 2.8: Rankings of Bangladesh in the World Bank\\'s L ogistics Performance Index 2018  \\n \\nSource: World Bank , 2018  \\n2632394494100122\\n020406080100120140\\nChina Thailand Vietnam India Sri Lanka Bangladesh Pakistan  \\n \\n222 \\n The Way Forward : Exports stimulate imports. Delays in imports not only increase the costs to the firms \\nimporting them, but it also puts them in a tight situation when many of these imports are raw materials for \\nexport -oriented industries. After Bangladesh graduates from LDC status in 2024, the competitiveness \\nchallenge will intensify. In order to maintain their market share in the more competitive environment, it \\nwill be vital for all the firms to h ave timely and less costly access to raw materials, maintain their production \\nschedules and ship their products to their buyers on time. Chittagong port handles 75% of Bangladesh’s \\n$100 billion of export -import trade. Ship turnaround time and cargo clearan ce from container yards are \\nlonger than most ports in the region. O perational efficiency at the port must be radically enhanced to ensure \\nlower  turnaround  time for vessel s in order to benchmark good productivity and performance in this port. \\nHigh efficienc y in import clearance at ports is critical for export competitiveness.  \\n2.6.2  Strengthening Electricity and Transport Infrastructure . \\nIn today’s globalized environment, infrastructure is one fundamental determinant of external \\ncompetitiveness. While high GD P growth has been achieved, for further growth acceleration and achieving \\nthe medium to long -term socio -economic development targets, improved infrastructure including expanded \\nand uninterrupted power supplies will be crucial. Besides, Bangladesh’s inabili ty to attract enough quantum \\nof FDI as well as mobilizing higher levels of domestic private investment is often attributable to the lack \\nof adequate and reliable infrastructure services. The 6th and 7th Five Year Plans rightly prioritized the need \\nfor impr oved power, energy, transport and other infrastructure -related services for achieving GDP g rowth \\nand development targets. The implementation of these plans has been backed by enhanced resource \\nallocation through the Annual Development Programme (ADP), leve raging private investments in the \\npower sector with policy and institutional support.  \\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in terms of upgrading power and transport infrastructure. But the \\nmagnitude of the infrastructure gap can be gauged from cross -country comparison of infrastructure \\nadequacy. The World Economic Forum regularly publishes global comparisons on competitiveness based \\non 12 broad pillars. Quality of infrastructure is one of them. Despite Bangladesh’s notable economic growth \\nperformance an d an impressive record of social progress, the country lags many other Asian developing \\neconomies on infrastructure -related indicators. In 201 9 the GCI ranking for Bangladesh infrastructure stood \\nat 114 out of 14 1 countries (Figure 2.9).   \\nFigure 2.9: Glob al Competitiveness Index; Ranking in Infrastructure , 2019  \\n \\nSource: Global Competitiveness Report 2019, World Economic Forum.  1141107170676136\\nBangladeshPakistanThailandIndiaVietnamSri LankaChina  \\n \\n223 \\n The way forward : Keeping in mind the rise of projected demand for electricity to 34,000 MW by 2030, the \\ngovernment is planning to  invest around $70 billion in the power sector over the next 15 years. It is \\nimportant that this investment is based on using least cost options and renewable energy to the extent \\ntechnically possible to lower the cost of electricity, to ensure the sustain ability of primary energy supply \\nand to reduce carbon pollution.   \\nThe current road network in Bangladesh is yet inadequate to provide infrastructural support to a country \\nwith a population of more than 160 million people which is aspiring to become a High -Income Country in \\n2041. This is reflected in the GCI’s Road Connectivity Index, where Bangladesh is given a score 57.5 out \\nof 100 and a rank of 1 17 out of 14 1. In transport there is presently excessive relian ce on the road network. \\nThis is very costly and  will also become increasingly difficult owing to the growing land constraint and the \\ncosts of rehabilitation of large number of displaced people. On the other hand, as analysed in great detail in \\nthe Delta Plan  2100  the inland waterways are low -cost and e nvironment -friendly option and in the past that \\nhas not received adequate attention. Implementation of the inland waterway development strategy \\narticulated in the Delta Plan will be of high priority. Additionally, much more attention needs to be given \\nto the issue of inter -modal transport balance based on cost and efficiency.  \\n2.6.3  Improving Technology Transfer and Market Access through  FDI.  \\nExport expansion and diversification is often constrained by limited domestic capital, technology and \\nmarket knowled ge. It is not surprising that the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in promoting export -\\noriented industrialization has attracted considerable attention in recent times. FDIs with their better \\ntechnological and managerial skills and knowledge about in ternational marketing conditions, are expected \\nto improve the productivity as well as export performance of host country firms by creating certain positive \\nexternalities known as ‘ spill overs ’. Spill overs  can take place when FDI improves the productive \\nefficiencies of domestic firms, making their products efficient in price and quality in the international \\nmarket and thus improving their export performance. Such spill overs  may occur either to domestic firms \\nin the same industry group of foreign firms thro ugh competition, known as ‘horizontal spill overs ’, or to \\nfirms in the upstream supply chain through buyer -supplier linkages, known as ‘backward spill overs ’. FDI \\ncan help to channel capital and technology into industries that have the potential to compete  internationally, \\nand the global linkages of multinational corporations can facilitate their access to foreign markets. In \\naddition to exports that are generated directly by foreign affiliates, FDI can also promote exports of \\ndomestic firms through the tea ching of proper marketing strategies, methods, procedures, and channels of \\ndistribution.  \\nFDI strengthens competitiveness and fuels GVC exports . Finally, FDI is critical in supply chain trade \\n(SCT). Bangladesh needs to get on the bandwagon of GVCs as a mean s to export -oriented industrialization. \\nCross -border FDI flows have been the lifeline for the growth of GVC (or SCT) trade that helps sustain the \\ngrowing production networks across borders. Therefore, courting FDI in the future to capture and expand \\nsupply  chains will have to be an essential strategy for Bangladesh’s export -oriented industrialization. \\nBecause of the widespread existence of production fragmentation across borders – a phenomenon that \\ncreates challenges as well as opportunities - a better unde rstanding of how Bangladesh as an LDC is \\npositioned within global value chains is absolutely critical. In Asia, FDI has played a particularly catalytic \\nrole in stimulating trade in intermediate goods over the past 25 years or so.    \\n \\n224 \\n The way forward : Currently , Bangladesh faces the dual challenge of mobilizing more FDI and into the \\nGVC operation. That is, its best chance of getting on the GVC bandwagon lies in aggressively courting FDI \\nfrom multinationals that are seeking low -cost locations for producing parts and components or for final \\nassembly within the framework of cross -border production integration. FDI thus becomes critical for \\nBangladesh to not only develop a wider base of intermediate goods industry but also to diversify exports \\ninto intermediate goods  by vertically integrating with cross -border production entities. It needs to translate \\nits RMG experience with GVC on to other sectors like Footwear and Leather goods, electronics, light \\nengineering, toys, plastics, and other sectors with an aggressive st rategy of FDI -driven GVC over the course \\nof the next decade. That would constitute a new form of export -oriented industrialization for Bangladesh \\non way to graduating out of LDC status and becoming a UMIC.  \\n2.6.4  Improving the Investment Climate  \\nDespite pr ogress with the policy environment for the private sector that has spurred the expansion of private \\ninvestment from a low of 6% of GDP in FY1989 to 24% of GDP in FY2019, the overall investment climate \\nfor Bangladesh remains substantially weaker than those found in competing countries. This is reflected in \\nthe global rankings of investment climate prepared by the World Bank. For example, the World Bank’s \\n2020 Ease of Doing Business (EDB) ranks Bangladesh at 168th out of 190 countries (Figure 2.10). The \\nmore advanced economies of the ASEAN countries perform much better than the South Asian countries in \\nthe rankings due to their institutional strengths and openness to trade (Figure 2.11).  \\nFigure 2.10: Ease of Doing Business Rank of the South Asian Countries in 2020  \\n \\n    Source: World Bank Doing Business 2020  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 17316814710899948963\\nAfghanistanBangladeshMaldivesPakistanSri LankaNepalBhutanIndia  \\n \\n225 \\n Figure 2.11: Ease of Doing Business Rank of the South -East Asian Countries in 2020  \\n \\n   Source: World Bank Doing Business 2020  \\nThese rankings reflect Bangladesh’s shortcomings in the various factors wh ich are taken into consideration \\nfor these computations. The evidence also shows very little progress over the past several years. Similarly, \\nthe World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) puts Bangladesh at 103 out of 140 \\ncountries surveyed  for 2018. According to the World Bank’s EDB rankings, the major problem areas that \\nlower Bangladesh performance include weak infrastructure services and high transaction costs relating to \\npaying taxes, registering property, enforcing contracts and trading  across border. Additionally, the \\navailability of serviced land with all necessary infrastructure connections including electricity, water, and \\nindustrial waste disposal facility is a major hassle that lowers private investment in the manufacturing \\nsector.  To strengthen the investment climate to attract domestic and foreign investments, these constraints \\nwill have to be addressed head on in the next 5 years to bring significant improvement in the investment \\nclimate.  \\nIn order to improve its position in the E ase of Doing Business and Global Competitiveness rankings, \\nBangladesh can take inspiration from Vietnam that had to go through reconstruction after a long and \\ndevastating conflict around the same time as our War of Independence.  The country improved its ra nking \\nin the Global Competitiveness Report from 77th in 2006 to 55th in 2017, while its improvement in the Ease \\nof Doing Business has been even more impressive – from 104th in 2007 to 69th in 2019. The reasons behind \\nthis jump were the reforms which Hanoi undertook with regards to paying taxes, trading across borders, \\nenforcing contracts, access to credit and getting electricity.  \\nThe Way Forward:  Bangladesh has taken some positive steps to address the serviced land constraint \\nthrough industrial parks  and s pecial economic zones.  This is a welcome move.  Speedy completion of all \\non-going  facilities and making those available on a timely and business -friendly way will be an important \\nfactor to spur domestic and foreign investment.  The Government is focusing top attention on reducing the \\ntime it takes to (i) get electricity (ii) registe r property (iii) obtain credit  (iv) trading across  borders (v) enforce \\ncontracts  and (vi) resolve insolvencies. If carrying out reforms addressing these issues results in an \\nimprovement of the country’s rank for Ease of Doing Business, this should give a positive signal to potential \\ninvestors around the world that the climate for investment in Bangladesh is improving due to sincere efforts 1651541449573706621122\\nMyanmarLaosCambodiaPhilippinesIndonesiaVietnamBruneiThailandMalaysiaSingapore  \\n \\n226 \\n by the government. Improvements in the a bove areas are being developed under the direct supervision of \\nthe Prime Minister and coordinated by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA).  In \\naddition, a strong marketing effort is being launched by BIDA and Commercial Wings in Banglades h’s \\ndiplomatic missions around the world (especially Europe and North America) to highlight and showcase \\nthe progress made on the investment climate front as a means to attract FDI.  \\n2.6.5  Strengthening the Institutions for Trade and Industry.  \\nA careful r eview of economic history suggests that rapid growth that transforms developing economies into \\ndeveloped economies in the course of a generation requires a combination of two things: sound economic \\npolicies and good institutions to implement them. Research  has shown that differences in institutions related \\nto trade and industrial activity explain a good deal of why export and industrial performance differs across \\ncountries. There is much to be done in reforming several of the institutions in Bangladesh that  deal with \\ntrade and industry, particularly in the area of promoting exports and its diversification.  \\nThe next decade will be crucial for strengthening economic institutions that will help entrepreneurs seize \\nmarket opportunities emerging in a fast -changin g global economy driven by innovation and creative \\ndestruction. In order to attain and sustain high economic growth what is needed is building and nurturing \\ninclusive economic institutions that are effective in enforcing property rights, creating a level p laying field \\nfor small and large entrepreneurs, SMEs and big business, and encouraging investment in innovation, \\nadoption of new technologies and developing skills for the future.   \\nThe Way Forward : Transforming the Bangladesh economy into a high -income ec onomy over the next 25 \\nyears will require strengthening of institutions that promote sound economic fundamentals, enhance \\nfunctioning of markets for efficient resource allocation, and foster competitive discipline. Intervention in \\nmarkets would have to be kept to a minimum. The record of high -performing economies show that \\npromotion of specific industries did not yield results as industrial development tended to be market -\\nconforming and exports performed better when driven by factor -intensity based comparat ive advantage. \\nThat means we need to revisit the approach to “thrust sectors” providing instead a conducive policy \\nenvironment for all investors and let those  with the best potential success .  \\nAs Bangladesh graduates out of its LDC status, it will need to be cognizant of some WTO rules that it had \\nhitherto ignored – particularly, those relating to levels of protective tariffs and para -tariffs. Other \\nmultilateral disciplines will also come into play, such as rules governing intellectual property, subsidies, \\nstandards, and trade -related investment, which are going to be the same for developing and developed \\neconomies. Moreover, if Bangladesh were to seek membership of regional trading blocs, like RCEP, it \\nwould have to submit to their disciplines which are als o likely to be stringent. Broadly speaking, economic \\ninstitutions in Bangladesh will have to start getting ready to face and conform to a more competitive and \\nrules -based global trading environment in the future. Nevertheless, trade facilitation with impro ved customs \\ninfrastructure and administration will remain effective mechanisms to promote exports while being \\nconsistent with multilateral rules.  \\nOnce the above policies are effectively put in place, overall growth and manufacturing development can \\nfollow  the evolution presented in Table 2.10. FY20 -21 growth rates, overall and industry/manufacturing, \\nreflect the Covid19 shock plus recovery. The economy is expected to return to its pre -COVID -19 growth   \\n \\n227 \\n trajectory in FY22 and beyond. The effect of export -led trade and industrial policies articulated in the \\npreceding sections are expected to give the neces sary boost to industrial growth  of which manufacturing is \\nthe major component.  The 8 FYP projections indicate manufacturing growth to rise from 5.84% in FY2 0 \\nto 12.60 % in FY25, with its share in GDP rising from 24.18 % in FY2 0 to 30.23% in FY25. Manufacturing \\nwill by far be the principal driver of rapid GDP growth during the 8FYP.   \\nTable 2.10: GDP and Broad Sectoral Growth Rates and Shares FY 2020-FY20 25 \\nSectors  2019(Actual)  2020 \\n(Actual)  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\n \\nGrowth Rate (Percent)  \\nAgriculture  3.92 3.11 3.47 3.83 4.10 4.00 3.90 \\nIndustry  12.67  6.48 10.29  10.59  10.79  11.20  11.90  \\no/w Manufacturing  14.20  5.84 10.73  10.99  11.24  12.00  12.60  \\nServices  6.78 5.32 6.74 6.95 7.25 7.30 7.35 \\nGDP  8.15 5.24 7.40 7.70 8.00 8.32 8.51 \\n Share as % of GDP (Constant prices)  \\nAgriculture  13.65  13.35  12.84  12.36  11.89  11.16  10.56  \\nIndustry  35.00  35.36  36.25  37.17  38.07  40.37   41.86  \\no/w Manufacturing  24.08  24.18  24.89  25.61  26.33 28.75  30.23  \\nServices  51.35  51.30  50.91  50.47  50.04  48.47   47.58  \\n  Source: GED P rojections  \\n2.7 WTO -CONSISTENT INDUSTRIAL POLICY FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT   \\nIn Bangladesh, as elsewhere, trade policy is an instrument of and an integral part of industrial policy . And \\nindustrial development is an integral part of any economy’s growth strategy. So, it is and has been for \\nBangladesh for the past several decades. Structural change in our economy validates an important stylized \\nfact of development where the share of i ndustry rises over time, at 34% of GDP in FY2019 compared to \\nonly 14% in 1972. With impending LDC graduation it has also become essential to conduct an effective, \\nWTO -consistent industrial policy. Given the changing global and domestic landscape, our indus trial policy \\nwill have to encompass government efforts to promote industrialization that generates export -led and \\nproductivity -based rapid growth. In practice, industrial policy may include such goals as employment \\ngeneration, increased output, removing re gional disparity in incomes or investment, and enhancing \\ntechnological capacity. The priority goal should be to promote industrial growth that is export -oriented and \\njob creating.  \\nInstruments of industrial polic:  Bangladesh has been using a wide range of interventions in articulating its \\nindustrial policy. These could be categorized as external, product, and factor market interventions.  \\n\\uf0b7 External market interventions  involve protecting domestic industries from import competition, \\nusing instruments such as tariffs and para -tariffs, import quotas (eliminated since 2004), backward \\nlinkage programmes , as well as export promotion measures (e.g. duty -free import of inputs, EPZs \\nor SEZs, cash subsidies, concessional loans) to assist industries to catch up and brea k into new \\nmarkets. Other policies directed to exports include promotion of FDI and participation in \\ninternational networks, appropriate macroeconomic policies, efficient infrastructure and supporting   \\n \\n228 \\n services, and policies to enhance human capital and tec hnological capability, such as research and \\ndevelopment, education, and creation of industrial clusters.  \\n\\uf0b7 Product market intervention that includes domestic market entry regulations, regulatory control \\nand tax policies to ensure fair competition between do mestic and foreign firms, promoting domestic \\ncontent requirements.  \\n\\uf0b7 Factor market interventions include policies such as performance requirements and restrictions on \\nFDI designed to influence the operation of foreign affiliates so that Bangladesh realizes a net benefit \\nfrom FDI. Significant factor market interventions are prevalent in the capital market and the \\nfinancial sector aimed at promoting infant industries, and protecting declining industries. For this \\npurpose , there are development finance institut ions providing investible capital to selected \\nindustrial enterprises, furnishing capital subsidies and capital assistance to declining or mature \\nindustries and providing priority access to subsidized and directed credit by requiring financial \\ninstitutions to lend to “thrust” sectors (selected sectors with presumptive potential for future growth \\nbased on recent performance).  \\n \\nWTO -compliant Industrial Policy Instruments : Being a founding member and a major beneficiary of \\nthe WTO rules -based system of multila teral trade, it is incumbent upon Bangladesh to adhere by WTO rules \\nregarding application of industrial policy instruments. Some of these instruments widely used in \\nBangladesh are highlighted here.  \\nTariffs and para -tariffs : Tariffs are now the principal in strument of protection of domestic industries. \\nAlthough WTO only recognizes custom duties (CD) as the only tariff Bangladesh uses supplementary and \\nregulatory duties (SD and RD) for additional protection though, ostensibly, these are levied for revenue \\npurposes. WTO rules regard such para -tariffs under the nomenclature of other duties and charges (ODC). \\nAs an original WTO member, Bangladesh was subject to limited extent of tariff bindings or tariff caps. \\nBangladesh agreed to bind all agricultural tariff lin es at 200% and only 5% of non -agricultural tariff lines \\nat rates ranging from 3% on sparking plugs (HS3808.92) to 50% on sweet biscuits and wafers (HS1905.31). \\nGenerally, bound tariffs are much higher than the applied tariffs (CD). However, when ODCs are i ncluded, \\nthere are instances where applied tariffs exceed bound tariffs (e.g. biscuits, sparking plugs). Upon \\ngraduation from LDC in 2024, such deviation of WTO rules could evince complaints (and safeguard tariffs) \\nfrom trading partners; so, it would be wi se to restrict the level of applied tariffs within bound rates.  \\nExport subsidies and other support measures : The Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures \\n(SCM) prohibits export subsidies by countries with GNI per capita above US$1000 (at constan t 1990 US$), \\nwith an exception for LDCs and some developing countries (listed in ANNEX VII of SCM Agreement) \\nwith GNI per capita below US$1000. Bangladesh currently offers cash subsidies to 35 export products \\nranging from 4% (export to non -traditional mark ets) to 20% (fruits and vegetables). Upon graduation in \\n2024, Bangladesh will not have this option as an LDC but may still enjoy the exemption if its per capita \\nGNI is still below US$1000 (at constant 1990 US$), provided it applies to WTO for maintaining t he \\nexemption to be listed among the countries in ANNEX VII. Subsidies towards protecting local content use \\nare also prohibited, but with the exception for LDCs. Roughly one -half of export subsidies in Bangladesh \\ngo towards supporting backward linkage in te xtiles and garments. This option could be in jeopardy in 2024 \\nor thereafter. Finally, according to WTO procedures adopted in November 2001  export subsidies are \\nprohibited in cases where the export product exceeds 3.25% market share globally because then th e product   \\n \\n229 \\n is deemed to have become competitive and the infant industry export support does not apply. RMG exports \\nwith 6.5% global market share falls in this category; therefore, any or all export subsidies to RMG exports \\nare not WTO -consistent.  \\nTrade -Related Intel lectual Property Rights (TRIPS):  This is a major facility accorded to LDCs like \\nBangladesh, one that has allowed Bangladesh to develop a robust pharmaceutical industry manufacturing \\ngeneric drugs (through reverse engineering or imitation of brand  name patented drugs) without any patent \\ninfringement. Thanks to this facility Bangladesh pharma ceutical  industry now meets 97% of the domestic \\nrequirement of all drugs besides exporting about $150 million of medicines to some 60 countries. The \\nperiod for this facility for LDCs was extended to 2033 but if Bangladesh graduates out of LDC in 2024 it \\nwill expire in that year. The option for seeking a transition period and/or extension to 2033 would require \\napplying to the WTO but chances are that developed cou ntries will put up strong opposition to accepting \\nsuch a request.  \\nTRIPS agreement which was actually directed to strengthening of protection of intellectual property rights \\n(IPR), has important implications for industrial policy. Because developing countr ies do not in general have \\na comparative advantage in innovation, attracting FDI as a means of transferring and diffusing technology \\nis important for them. An important provision for developing countries from an industrial policy perspective \\nis TRIPS Artic le 66.2, which requires industrial countries to support technology transfer to LDCs. As IPR \\nprotection improves, firms from developed countries are expected to have greater incentive to invest in and \\noperate in developing country markets. So IPR strengthen ing would be one item to focus on if Bangladesh \\nwants to attract more FDI.  \\nIn sum, it is critically important to conduct industrial policy that maximizes its potential to contribute to \\neconomic growth while minimizing the risks that it will generate waste  and rent -seeking. Bangladesh \\nindustrial policy to be WTO -consistent will have to be comprehensive rather than target specific sectors; \\nthat is, there should be a concerted effort to shift toward more generic policies for promoting industrial \\ndevelopment. Policies related to infrastructure, human capital formation, innovation through more R&D, \\nand diffusion of technology is now critical for export competitiveness. WTO -consistent industrial policy \\ninstruments for Bangladesh would include tariffs (within boun d rates); subsidies for regional \\nconnectivity, R&D, and the environment; and export promotion measures such as credit and insurance \\nschemes at subsidized rates, concessional tax and duty provisions, and export processing zones (EPZ) \\nand special economic zo nes (SEZ).  \\nStanding by WTO commitments : Bangladesh is a founding member of the World Trade Organization  and \\nas a significant beneficiary of the multilateral regime,  it is incumbent upon Bangladesh to be compliant of \\nWTO  rules and regulations, availing of the opportunities under the WTO, building trade capacities and \\nprotecting the interest of the state in international trade regime.  \\nSupported by the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) WTO cell in the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) has \\naccomplished ‘Diagnostic  Trade Integration Study’ to radically improve Bangladesh’s trade regime. This \\nstudy ended up with an Action Matrix identifying the existing trade barriers in the country leading to \\naddressing those by own funds and various Aid for Trade (AfT) schemes. Mor eover, studies like ‘Export \\nPotentiality of Trade in Services of Bangladesh: Identifying opportunities and challenges’ and ‘Identification \\nof Non -tariff Barriers Faced by Bangladeshi Products in Major Export Markets’ have been completed . The   \\n \\n230 \\n findings of th ose studies will help in formulating export strategy and action plan. Improved  negotiation skill \\nof the officials, heighte ned trade in services, reducing  of non -tariff barriers will be in the sight once these \\nprojects are implemented. Other projects under MoC i.e., 1) Bangladesh Regional Connectivity Project 2) \\nExport Diversification and Competitiveness Development Project (Tier -2), 3) E - banijjo  korbo, nijer babsa \\ngorbo project will certainly contribute to establish digital   Bangladesh as envisaged under the “Vision -2021” \\nand the Perspective Plan  2021 . Additionally, Digital Commerce Policy -2018 has been approved by the \\nCabinet and duly made  operational.  Under this policy, an e -Commerce Cell will work to coordinate and \\nboost up electronic commerce in Bangla desh.    \\nThe WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement came into force on 22nd February 2017 with the stipulated \\nratification of two -third members of the WTO. Bangladesh also ratified the Agreement on 13th June 2016 \\nas the 94th country. This is the first multilater al agreement after the establishment of the WTO in 1995. The \\nmain objective of the Agreement is to establish a modern trade facilitation system globally so that time and \\ncost of trade transactions can be reduced significantly. The LDCs, including Banglades h, have been granted \\nvarious flexibilities under this Agreement.  \\nThe Ministry of Commerce has been taking different initiatives to increase export under the multilateral \\ntrading system. Bangladesh has made progress in getting duty free quota free facility  (DFQF) from many \\ndeveloped countries , thereby enjoying the preferential market access to almost all the major markets under \\nWTO. DFQF facility for LDCs has also been promised by several developing countries: China, India, South \\nKorea, Chile, and Thailand.  All developed countries excluding the USA, Russia and Ireland gives DFQF  \\nfacility for most products of LDCs. Furthermore, the European Union, Canada and China have simplified \\ntheir Rules of Origin for LDCs.  \\n2.8 COURTING FTA FOR RAPID MARKET ACCESS EXPANSION  \\nA Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) among member countries provides preferential market access, \\nthrough duty concessions or other means, to selected products of member countries (e.g. Asia Pacific Trade \\nAgreement (APTA), of which Bangladesh is a member ). A Free Trade Agreement – FTA- is an extreme \\nform of a PTA providing duty -free or lower -duty access to markets of partner countries on a wide range of \\nproducts, typically with a small negative list of products (sensitive list). Thus , a PTA is characterized by a \\n“positive list” of products whereas an FTA is characterized by a “negative list”. An FTA could be bilateral \\n(e.g. Vietnam and Japan), or regional (e.g. ASEAN), or plurilateral (among several countries spread across \\ngeographical regions; e.g. CPTPP -Com prehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans -Pacific \\nPartnership). Some 300 PTAs/FTAs have been notified to the WTO which has seen the proliferation of \\nPTAs/FTAs since 2000. Typically, two conditions mark all TPAs/FTAs: (a) reciprocity (in contrast with \\nnon-reciprocity of GSP schemes), and (b) rules of origin (ROO), to ensure that substantial transformation \\nof a product has occurred in the partner countries to deserve preferential access. The rules of origin are \\ntherefore a key element determining the mag nitude of the economic benefits that accrue from preferential \\ntrade agreements and who gets them.  \\nThe multilateral trading system is now characterized by a multiplicity of overlapping and intersecting \\nPTAs/FTAs with complex web of tariff schedules and ROOs . Each PTA/FTA creates its own web of \\nregulatory rules that coexist alongside multilateral rules. The attraction of an FTA stems from the fact that \\nit offers members a means of securing enhanced market access and attracting investment. A bilateral FTA   \\n \\n231 \\n requires the assent of both governments, which becomes easier when there is a balance in the potential trade \\nbetween the countries. It is understood that Bangladesh has received requests for bilateral trade negotiations \\nfor FTA from several countries including  China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Nepal.  \\nFor Bangladesh, an FTA could be an attractive proposition in the context of market losses due to preference \\nerosion following graduation in 2024. The only FTA that Bangladesh is signatory to is the South Asian  \\nFree Trade Agreement (SAFTA)) which, according to most analysts, has not made much headway in \\nexpanding intra -regional trade in South Asia – an avowed goal of the Agreement.  \\nPost-LDC Bangladesh may have to negotiate a trading arrangement with the EU along  with the possibility \\nof another one with the post -Brexit United Kingdom to ensure favourable access to these important markets. \\nBeyond that, Bangladesh may seek more bilateral or regional FTAs if the projected trade creation (or trade \\ngrowth) contributes positively to growth and employment creation.  \\nFirst, it is important to acknowledge that Bangladesh is a significant beneficiary of the multilateral trading \\nsystem (WTO) and its special and differential dispensation for LDCs and developing countries. It w ould be \\nin the best interests of Bangladesh to continue to be a strong participant under this global system of \\ncompliance of trade rules even after graduation.  \\nIn the meanwhile, since the multilateral system does permit the contracting of preferential tra ding \\narrangements, such as a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), departing from the guiding principle of non -\\ndiscrimination defined in Article  I of GATT, Article  II of GATS, and elsewhere. FTAs may be signed under \\nArticle XXIV of the GATT, which allows for the for mation of trade blocs, permitting WTO members of a \\ntrade bloc to discriminate against non-members , as long as the agreement results in trade liberalization \\namong the signatories extends what is available under the WTO. FTAs in recent times are seldom limit ed \\nto just trade in goods, as they encompass services as well as investment.  \\nOf late, the multilateral trade regime and its offshoot, globalization, has come under serious strain from the \\nrise in economic nationalism and protectionism. Consequently, a gro wing number of nations, both \\ndeveloped and developing, have been seeking to sign FTAs on a regional or bilateral basis. Bangladesh, \\nwith only one regional FTA (SAFTA) and no bilateral FTA in its armour , has fallen behind in this game of \\ntrade openness beyo nd the WTO. Basically, an FTA has the potential of creating access to larger markets \\nfor Bangladesh exports. But they have advantages and disadvantages.  \\nOn the plus side, an FTA can force local industries to improve competitively and rely less on governme nt \\nsubsidies. These can open new markets, increase GDP, and invite new investments. They also allow \\ncompanies to discover new technologies and better ways of doing things. FTAs could trigger a beneficial \\nprocess of \"competitive liberalisation\", as nations vie to open their markets to each other.  On the downside, \\nFTAs could bring disruptive competition, destruction of traditional livelihoods, with adverse implications \\nfor employment. Given Bangladesh’s high protection regime, an FTA with Malaysia (whose aver age tariff \\nis 6.2%) would imply “enhanced protection” for Malaysian exporters while Bangladesh exporters would \\nface “reduced protection”. An FTA with Malaysia would also require substantial scaling down of protective \\ntariffs which could be a major politica l economy challenge.    \\n \\n232 \\n Whereas Bangladesh’s preferential access into major global markets under WTO system relies on the \\nunilateral provision, a fundamental tenet of FTA is “reciprocity”. Concessions in the liberalization process \\nhave to be offered, though t here is scope for negotiations for staggered adjustments of tariffs or other trade \\nbarriers. Where Bangladesh is involved in a North -South (i.e. developed and developing country) \\narrangement, tariff reductions on its part could have a longer timeline. Gain s from an FTA is expected to \\nbe greater when such FTA opens larger markets (e.g. North -South FTA, such as between B angladesh and \\nOECD members).T here are potentially large market creation effects to be had from engaging with regional \\nassociations (South -South) like the BIMSTEC, ASEAN or its surrogate, the Regional Comprehensive \\nEconomic Partnership (RCEP) that adds six more FTA partners.  \\nHowever, it is worth keeping a few things in mind while considering FTAs:  \\n\\uf0b7 Deeper, broader, rapid liberalization under an  FTA produces a bigger effect. Firms are less likely \\nto incur additional administrative costs if the tariff advantage provided by the FTA is small.  \\n\\uf0b7 The FTA impact will be greater if the impediments to trade removed by the FTA are large relative \\nto those th at remain untouched.  \\n\\uf0b7 The most fundamental factor is the capacity of our economy to increase supply of products for \\nwhich the FTA has boosted demand.  \\n\\uf0b7 They reinforce the point that any contribution of an FTA to Bangladesh’s economic development \\nis likely to be influenced heavily by the broader policy stance of its government, the flexibility of \\nthe economy and the extent to which supply can respond to any new demand that has been created.  \\n\\uf0b7 We could target FTA with countries that have already shown interest, su ch as Malaysia, China, \\nIndia (post -LDC, as SAFTA already gives market access), and Thailand . Emerging market \\neconomies would also be good candidates, quite apart from OECD member countries. The point to \\nnote is that gains from any FTA will be minimal if th e market size of the partner country is small.  \\n\\uf0b7 Most importantly, the first item in an FTA relates to trade openness in terms of tariffs. With its sky -\\nhigh tariff regime relative to its comparators, that is where Bangladesh will face a major hurdle in \\ngetting prospective FTA suitors to come calling. Mutually reciprocating tariff reductions are \\nusually critical items in any FTA negotiation. But when tariffs are very high, as is the case for \\nBangladesh, the leverage from offering tariff reductions is all but lost. Thus,  rationalizing \\nBangladesh’s tariff structure then becomes a national imperative if the country seeks FTAs with \\nany country or region in the future. FTA negotiations could be highly complex and take long \\nperiods of time.   \\nAs Government policy, Ba ngladesh attaches high importance on bilateral and regional trade cooperation. It \\nhas signed a number of bilateral trade and investment cooperation Agreements. Beside the WTO \\nmembership, the country is also a member of SAPTA, SATS, SAFTA, APTA, BIMSTEC, TI P-OIC and \\nD-8 Preferential Trade Agreements. Bangladesh would continue its endeavours in RTA negotiations for \\nensuring better market access. Bangladesh will be officially graduating from the Least Developed Country \\n(LDC) status in 2024. The graduation is e xpected to have some adverse impact on trade as the country will \\nlose preferential market access in its major markets. The Ministry of Commerce will therefore prepare and \\nimplement an action plan for overcoming the potential challenges of trade and commerc e after graduation.  \\n   \\n \\n233 \\n Therefore, the Government has adopted a policy of signing FTAs with potential partners to overcome the \\ngraduation challenges, particularly to meet the trade challenges, especially after phasing out of Duty -Free \\nQuota Free (DFQF) and Ev erything but Arms (EBA) market access facility. The Ministry is now \\nnegotiating with a number trading partners for signing bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or \\nPreferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The Ministry of Commerce aims to accord as many as PTAs, FTA s \\nand continue efforts joining CEPA during the 8th Five Year Plan. The Ministry prepared a Policy Guideline \\nfor Free Trade Agreement in 2010. The Policy needs to be updated to meet the requirement of time. The \\nMinistry plans to revise the Free Trade  Agreement policy guideline during the 8th Five Year Plan to make \\nit more pragmatic.  \\nThe Ministry of Commerce has already completed its assessment for initiating FTA/PTA negotiations with \\nSri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States  of America. It has undertaken another \\nstudy for examining the impact of signing FTA/PTA with Lebanon. The Ministry has also taken program \\nfor conducting the joint study on Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India. At \\npresent, four bo rder H aats had been set up at the border’s  points of both Bangladesh and India in ensuring \\navailability of essential commodities to the marginalized people living in the surrounding remote areas.  16 \\nmore border H aats are expected to be opened during the 8FYP period.  \\nIt is necessary to explore the possibility of signing FTA with trade blocks of interest of Bangladesh. In this \\nregard initiative will be taken for signing FTA with European Union (EU), Association of Southeast Asian \\nNations (ASEAN), Eurasian Eco nomic Union (EAEU) & MERCOSUR Countries. The Ministry is \\ncurrently engaged in building trade negotiations capacity among officials in the Ministry and relevant \\nagencies.  \\nTo conclude, it is time to mainstream trade policy. For trade reform to unleash its c atalytic potential during \\nthe run up to LDC graduation it should be designed as part and parcel of Bangladesh’s 8th and 9th Five Year \\nPlans, where its role will be given due cognizance and the necessary facilitating infrastructure adequately \\nprovided to ma ke trade policy perform. In practical terms, this means incorporating trade issues into every \\nstage of the development planning cycle. This must be underpinned by strong inter -ministerial coordination \\nand consultative processes with a wide range of stakeho lders, including consumer groups.  \\n2.9 TECHNOLOGY, EMPLOYMENT AND 4th INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION  \\nThis chapter concludes with a brief message on the emerging challenge of labour  displacement and \\nemployment implications of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). As the digital economy gains a stronger \\nfoothold and digital technology spreads across all sectors and activities in Bangladesh, the manufacturing \\nsector cannot but embrace the benefits of technological sophistication to enhance productivity and maintain \\nglobal c ompetitiveness over time in the age of the 4IR. 4IR, primarily driven by automation, robotics and \\nartificial intelligence (AI), has been transforming the way we work, live, and produce goods and services. \\n4IR is both a destructive force and a creative forc e unleashing a tsunami  of Schumpeter’s famous “creative \\ndestruction” in the marketplace. In Bangladesh’s rapid march to industrial progress driven largely by \\nexport -led growth it faces the enormous challenge of coping with this technological transition so that the \\ngains far outweigh the loss.  \\n   \\n \\n234 \\n For Bangladesh, this slow but sure technological transformation in production, inescapable in the age of \\ninternet and growing digital sophistication of 4IR, undermines the time -tested principal of specialization \\nand competitiveness based on factor endowment –labour -intensive industrialization in the case of \\nBangladesh which is still endowed with abundance of low -skilled labour  force. The RMG industry is the \\nclassic case in point. Apparel production, particularly the fi nal stage of processing of garments, has been \\nfor the past 50 years a labour -intensive activity. Thanks to globalization and multilateral rules of open trade \\ncreating and opening vast global markets, Bangladesh was perhaps the most successful example of an  LDC \\nexploiting in full its comparative advantage in labour -intensive production and CAF -based exports of RMG, \\neventually becoming the second largest exporter of apparel in the world. With the rapid and deep \\ntechnological transformation occurring in the di gital age that static world of comparative advantage is \\nchanging fast.  \\nThe RMG sector is the lifeline of Bangladesh’s economy and industrial jobs. It turns out that this sector \\nhas been aggressively adopting automation technologies to cope up with the pre ssure of cost, quality, and \\nproduct cycle time. In terms of production per unit (unit measured by $ millions  of export revenue), o ver \\nthe last 35 years, research shows that reduction of labour  use per unit of output  has been as much as \\n350% . That is to say , that for every million dollars  of RMG exports, on average, the industry uses 3.5 times \\nless labour  than it used to 35 years ago, making the RMG industry much more technology intensive than \\nin the past. By the same token, the industry has become much more  technology and capital intensive and \\nmuch less labour -intensive than before. So far, the rapid growth in export volume has oﬀset the job loss \\ndue to automation.  \\nUnfortunately, growth is failing to cope up with the job loss due to automation, resulting in  net job loss. \\nDespite having fewer workers, falling from 4.4 to  4 million,  Bangladesh  succeeded  in nearly tripling the  \\nexport  volume  from  $12.5 billion  in FY2010  to $34 billion in FY2019. However, during this time, wage \\npressures with compliance costs hav e increased rapidly driving the industry to accelerate adoption of 4IR \\ntechnology. A joint research project by the ICT Division of Bangladesh Computer Council and UGC \\npredicted that by the end of the 8FYP  (2025), more than 40% labour reduction might take p lace in \\nproducing the same amount of RMG output produced today.  \\nThe reshoring prospect :  Moreover , due to the development of SewB ot in automating sewing, the reshoring \\nprospects (developed countries relocating apparel production in their own economies) is  getting far stronger \\nthan before. Bangladesh RMG growth has benefitted from many years of investors offshoring apparel \\nproduction to low -cost factories around the globe. With 4IR tech transformation  as the labour  content  in \\nproducing  apparel  keeps  falling , the offshoring  advantage keeps  eroding.  And at certain  point,  reshoring  \\nwould  take place.  But the world is far from reaching  the tipping  point.  Global analysts are still  developing  a \\ntheoretical  framework  to analyse  the offshoring  and reshoring  decisions  of firms  in the age of automation.  \\nAvailable  theory  suggests  that increasing  productivity in automation does lead to a relocation of previously \\noff-shored production back to the home economy but without improving low -skilled wages and without \\ncreating job s for low -skilled workers. Since it leads also to increasing wages for high -skilled workers, \\nautomation induced reshoring is associated with an increasing  skill premium  and increasing  inequality.  Such  \\ntheorization  endeavour  claims  that by using  a new measu re of reshoring  activity  and data from  the world  input  \\noutput  table,  there  is evidence  of a positive association  between  reshoring  and the degree  of automation.  On \\naverage,  within  manufacturing  sectors, an  increase  by one robot,  performing  jobs equivalent  to 6 workers,  for \\nevery 1000  workers  engaged in offshore production, there could be  a 3.5% increase in reshoring activity. There  may \\nbe disagreement  about  the numeric  figure  of implications  of automation  on reshoring  activity. But there is no   \\n \\n235 \\n denial that i ncreasing automation keeps eroding labour cost advantage, thereby decreasing the \\nattractiveness of offshoring. There is evidence that the degree of automation has been increasing in \\nBangladesh’s RMG sector over the past decade   \\nGreater reshoring would shri nk global demand or at least slow down import demand growth for apparels \\nfrom exporting countries like Bangladesh. On the positive side, apparel being a basic necessity, global \\ndemand growth is expected to be strongly correlated with income growth so that rising economies of non -\\nOECD countries (e.g. emerging markets of China, India, and other East Asian and Central Asian \\neconomies) could easily pick up the slack.  \\nRather than be too concerned about slack in global apparel demand Bangladesh must focus on cap turing a \\nbigger size of the market for, say, basic garments (where China is downsizing) and prepare the industry on \\nthe basis of double -digit growth in our export demand. Nevertheless, with the given progression of \\nautomation and likely growth of export vo lume (at 10% per year), it is being predicted that Ban gladesh’s \\nRMG sector will suﬀer a net loss of 1 million jobs by 2025, the closing year of the 8FYP . The Government \\nmust therefore begin taking measures for job creation in other potential sectors  (e.g. jute manufactures, \\nfootwear and leather goods, agro -processing, plastics, light engineering) by adopting necessary policy \\nreforms for invigorating the process of export diversification. Not to be ignored is the alarming research \\nfinding that women are far more likely than men to be retrenched from their jobs due to automation. That \\ncalls for a more forceful skill -development policy directed towards women with adequate investment in \\nTVET and other training options.  \\n2.10 DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN THE 8th PLAN  \\nThough public enterprises exist in a limited for m in jute and cotton textiles, and fertilizer sector, trade and \\nindustry are by and large in the realm of the private sector. Dynamism of the manufacturing sector, its \\nexport orientation, and job creation prospects depend on appropriate industrial and trad e policies that \\nsupport private sector initiatives to invest and become globally competitive. The primary role of \\nGovernment therefore lies in funding of support services in areas of trade policy, industrial policy, and \\nsmall and micro enterprises, rather than allocating public resources to install public enterprises. The \\nallocation of public investment will be available in Industrial and Economic Service sector . For \\nmanufacturing SOEs, the investment programme will be mainly financed from own resources. Th e \\nallocation of resources in the 8th Plan is basically intended to finance these support services for the \\nmanufacturing sector and fund activities or institutions that facilitate trade (Bangladesh Standards and \\nTesting Institute) and create market access ( e.g. PTAs and public expenditures incurred in opening of non -\\ntraditional markets) for Industrial and Economic Service sector . The following chapter on overall service \\nsector of the economy analyses the private sector investment in different services.

For an economy to undergo transformation from a low -\\nincome country to a high -income country traversing several decades of economic progress, significant \\nchange in the structure of the economy is inevitable. Broadly speaking, the stylized facts of such \\ntransformation indicate that the share of agriculture in output will be dwindling over time, as \\nindustrialization takes hold driving growth while creating wage empl oyment for the armies of redundant \\nlabour force leaving rural agriculture and migrating to urban centres that are home to industry, trade and \\nmodern services.  \\nThis is not to imply that agricultural output or its critical importance in the ec onomy will be declining. T he \\nhistorical record of progress towards a developed economy shows that the evolution of agriculture into a \\nhighly productive activity such that a small farm labour force complemented by modern technological \\ninputs is capable of meeting the dem and for cereals, meat, poultry, fisheries, and vegetables for the entire \\npopulation of the country and even leave some surplus for exports. Yet, even modern agriculture, with all \\nthe technologically driven productivity improvements over time, still suffers  from the vicissitudes of nature, \\nand historical output growth of agriculture in the developed or developing economies hovers around 3 -5% \\nannually. Thus, for all the productivity gains in agriculture, this sector cannot be counted on to drive high \\ngrowth i n a developing economy like Bangladesh whose share of agriculture has fallen a low of 14% of \\nGDP in FY20 20, from 60% in FY1973.  \\nFor developing economies seeking rapid growth in the range of 7 -8% or higher, the sectoral strategy boils \\ndown to rapid industr ialization as the growth driver. Development economists without exception have \\naccorded industrialization the role of prime mover in structural change during the evolutionary phase of \\neconomic progress. Historically, the one common feature of development h as been the secular rise in the \\nshare of industry in output compensating for the diminution in the share of agriculture. Concomitantly, \\nindustry has been responsible for the creation of wage employment in the modern sector as rural agriculture \\nshed its lab our force as rising productivity created a vast pool of redundant labour seeking gainful \\nemployment in non -farm and industrial activities. To this structural phenomenon was added the new \\nparadigm of manufacturing export led growth in the 1960s and 1970s th at only gave a new impetus to \\nindustrialization but also gave credence to a new strategy for rapid growth by leveraging the scale \\neconomies opened up by global markets.  This approach to industrialis ation and export led growth has been \\nthe cornerstone of Ba ngladesh’s development strategy for much of its existence with the result  that the \\nshare of industry raised  from a mere 10% in FY1973 to 35% in FY20 20. \\n  \\n   \\n \\n238 \\n 3.2 SERVICES AND STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION  \\nThe economy’s growth performance now hinges on a stable but d ynamic service sector. As it is the largest \\ncomponent of GDP, growth of the service sector  exerts the largest influence on the economy’s GDP growth \\nas well as its stability. International analysts who have reviewed Bangladesh’s growth performance over \\nthe past 25 years found that not only had Bangladesh economy achieved rapid growth but that growth was \\nfound to be relatively stable when compared to other high performers. Stability of service sector growth \\nrate has contributed to this long -term stability. No w, to this stability, the digital economy has infused a good \\nelement of dynamism. Digital economy, which is at once an input and output of the service sector, has \\nintroduced an element of innovation and speed in the overall performance of this sector which  is poised to \\nplay a pivotal role in accelerating Bangladesh’s growth. Digital economy will play a strong role in rebooting \\nand reshaping the country’s economy as it attempts to revive from the impact of COVID -19. \\nNotably, the service sector provides a con venient bridge for the transformation of the rural agrarian \\neconomy to a primarily urban industrial economy. In a typical transformation path, as the agriculture sector \\nmodernizes, labour transits initially from agriculture to mainly low -skill rural and ur ban services. These \\nservices, mostly informal in nature, provide a cushion for labour absorption as agricultural employment \\nshrinks. The labour thus released from agriculture eventually either retrains and gets distributed to \\nmanufacturing and modern servi ces, or stays put in informal services. The growth of services activities and \\nemployment is primarily a function of demand.  In today’s global world where labour and capital are \\nmobile, both domestic demand and world demand matter for the expansion of the service sector . \\nFigures 3.1a -3.1c portrays  structural change and the evolution of the Service sector  in High Income \\nCountries (HIC), Middle Income Countries (MIC), and Low -Income Countries (LIC) over the past four \\ndecades, from 1970. By 1970 the developed countries were already industrialized (averaging 40% of GDP \\nwith agriculture well below 5%). Thereon, the notable trend of structural transformation was the secular \\nrise of services to become the dominant economic activity in developed countries, from unde r 60% of GDP \\nin 1970 to 70% or higher by 2017. Between 1985 and 2000, there was a sharp rise in modern services \\nresulting from the spread of technological revolution across the developed world, with leading HICs having \\nhigh contributions in their GDPs from  their service sectors. This happened at the expense of some \\ndeindustrialization which started in the 1980s. The same trend, albeit somewhat modest, is noticeable in \\nmiddle income countries, where services accounted for over 50% but fewer than  60% of GDP, but the de -\\nindustrialization trend (falling share of industries in GDP) was more pronounced in HIC than in MIC. For \\nmost of this period, service sector  in LIC hovered around 40% of GDP though modestly showing signs of \\nupward movement.  \\nA look at the curren t state of the service sector  and its contribution in the economies of the world (Figure \\n3.2) shows economies placed in the higher income scale tend to have larger share of Services in GDP (HIC \\nhighest, followed by MIC, then LIC). It is also pertinent to n ote that more modern services with higher \\nproductivity are to be found in the developed economies of the world.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n239 \\n Figure 3.1: Structural Change in HIC, MIC, and LIC, 1970 – 2018  \\n(Shares as % of GDP)  \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), the World Bank  \\n \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), the World Bank  \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), the World Bank  020406080\\n1970 1980 1985 1995 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017% of GDPFig 3.1a: Share of Agriculture, Industry and Services in HICs\\nShare of Agriculture Share of Industry Share of Services\\n0204060\\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018% of GDPFig 3.1b: Share of Agriculture, Industry and Services in MICs\\nMiddle Income Countries Share of Agriculture\\nMiddle Income Countries Share of Industry\\nMiddle Income Countries Share of Services\\n01020304050\\n1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017% of GDPFig 3.1c: Share of Agriculture, Industry and Services in LICs\\nShare of Agriculture Share of Industry Share of Services  \\n \\n240 \\n Figure 3.2: Economic Contribution of Service sector , 2017  \\n \\n              Source: World Development Indicators (WDI), the World  Bank  \\nFinally, in 2018, the top 5 leading economies of the world (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1) reveal the culmination \\nof the structural transformation described above, with USA, Japan, and Germany, having predominant \\nservice sectors today (69 -77% of GDP), wit h China (52%) and India (59%) still on the march towards a \\ndynamic predomi nantly service driven economy.  \\nFigure 3.3: Structure of Five Largest Economies in the World by GDP, 2018  \\n \\n               Source: World Development Indicators (WDI), the World Bank  \\n \\n \\n010203040506070\\nLow income Middle\\nincomeHigh income South Asia India Bangladesh385470\\n49 4853% of GDP\\n020406080100120\\nUSA Japan Germany China India% of GDPShare of Agriculture, Industry and Services\\nShare of agriculture Share of Industry Share of services  \\n \\n241 \\n Table 3.1: Structure of Top 5 Economies in the World, 2018  \\n(% of GDP)  \\n  SHARE  \\nOF AGRICULTURE  SHARE  \\nOF INDUSTRY  SHARE OF SERVICES  \\nUSA  0.9 21.7 77.4 \\nGERMANY  0.8 27.5 71.7 \\nJAPAN  1.8 29.1 69.1 \\nCHINA  7.2 40.7 52.1 \\nINDIA  14.6 26.7 58.7 \\nSource: World De velopment Indicators (WDI), the World Bank  \\n \\nBangladesh, which is an LDC, was characterized as an LIC (World Bank classification) until 2015 when it \\nbecame a Lower Middle -Income Country (LMIC). Throughout its development process its structural \\ntransformatio n has followed the stylized facts of growth, where industrial growth overtakes growth in \\nagriculture with the result that share of industry in GDP rises to compensate for the shrinking share of \\nagriculture. As for services, Figure 3.4 reveals that by 1980 services overtook agriculture to become the \\nlargest sector in GDP (at about 50%). Since then, unlike what we observe in the case of HIC or MIC, \\nservices share in the economy has hovered around 50% of GDP, give or take a few percentage points. But, \\nas menti oned before, much of services in Bangladesh comprise of informal employment and economic \\nactivities like retail and wholesale trade, transport and communications, social and community services, \\netc. Only in the past two decades, the technological revolutio n is providing the impetus to the growth of a \\nmodern service sector with more formal employment and economic activities.   \\nFigure 3.4: Services in the Evolving Structure of the Bangladesh Economy (1976 – 2019)  \\n(Sectoral Shares as % of GDP)  \\n \\n        Source : Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\n \\nA striking aspect of the development of the service sector  in Bangladesh is that it not only has responded \\nwell to the growing demand emerging from the growth of manufacturing and agriculture activities, it has \\nalso positioned itself well in the global market for low -skilled workers, especially to the oil -rich middle -50\\n3230\\n24\\n181613 1321 21232628313748 485356 56 56\\n0102030405060\\nFY 1976 FY 1980 FY1990 FY 2000 FY 2010 FY 2015 FY 2019% of GDPAgriculture Industry Services  \\n \\n242 \\n eastern markets. As a result, there has been a rapid inflow of worker remittances that has fuelled a huge \\ndemand for construction activities and for a r ange of services in both urban and rural areas. This inflow of \\nremittances has played a major role in transforming the rural economy and contributing to poverty \\nreduction.    \\nThe service sector  itself is transforming. As Bangladesh transited from a low -income developing country \\nat the time of independence in 1972 to a Lower Middle -Income Country (LMIC) in 2015, the service sector  \\nhas been steadily transforming from a primarily low -productivity, low -income unorganized service sector  \\ndominated by trade, trans port and low -end personal services towards more organized and higher -income \\ncommercial services. In addition to the standard organized service activities provided by the public sector \\nthrough public administration, defence , law and order, education and hea lth services, the private service \\nsector  has undergone a slow but steady structural change in the form of growth of a range of modern \\ncommercial activities including banking and other financial services, shipping, Information \\nCommunications Technology (ICT ), aviation, tourism and hospitality services. Nevertheless, this \\ntransformation is rather slow and falls short of what has been achieved in neighbouring India. This is a \\nmissed opportunity that will need to be comprehensively addressed during the 8FYP in order to facilitate \\nthe transformation of the Bangladesh economy to a high -income economy, a challenge that is addressed in \\nChapter 12, Part 2 of the Plan Document.  \\nResearch evidence from South Asian countries reveals that services can be a driver of grow th, job creation, \\nand poverty reduction. Moreover, the role of services is critical in sustaining export -led growth. Tradability \\nof services has been driven by technological change (e.g. mobile telephone , internet), called splintering and \\ndisembodiment of services, so that many services are now tradable, just like manufactured goods. These \\nservices include communication, banking and finance, insurance, and back -office processing. These \\nservices have gone global thanks to technology, transportability, and tr adability – the 3Ts driving the \\nservices revolution. What is certain is that the old idea of services being non -scalable and non -tradable no \\nlonger holds for a host of modern services. Instead, given the right incentives and policy environment, \\nmodern serv ices could make significant contribution to growth of Total Factor Productivity (TFP), a key \\ncomponent of future growth acceleration. To sum up, services could be playing a leading role in changing \\nthe pattern of development and also accelerate growth in s ome developing countries. For Bangladesh, a \\ndynamic service sector  could provide an additional route to economic development.  \\nThis chapter looks at the developments in the service sector in terms of major achievements in growth, \\nemployment, exports and ru ral transformation and provides a strategy for further dynami sing the services’ \\nsector role over the next 5 years as Bangladesh graduates out of LDC status and aspires to achieve UMIC \\nstatus by FY2031. This chapter outlines the required policy and institut ional reforms needed to implement \\nthis strategy.  It also provides an outlook for the service sector with a view to supporting high growth in a \\ntransforming Bangladesh economy.  \\n3.3 SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN BANGLADESH  \\nThe service sector  continues to have the predominant weight in shaping Bangladesh’s GDP besides \\ncontributing to the stability in the rate of growth. In the following section the contribution of the service \\nsector  is reviewed in light of four critical and inter -linked economic indicators: GDP growth, employment, \\nexports, and rural transformation.    \\n \\n243 \\n 3.3.1  Contribution to GDP Growth  \\nOne striking aspect of the service sector in Bangladesh is that unlike the conventional wisdom that value -\\nadded and growth in services activities follow the growth in a griculture and manufacturing, the service \\nsector  has been a growth leader during the early part of Bangladesh’s development. This is illustrated in \\nFigure 3.4. In the early years after independence, as the relative role of agriculture fell, the service sec tor \\nexpanded rapidly, growing much faster than total GDP and its relative share rose from 35% in FY1974 -76 \\nto 50% in FY1980, then stabilized at just over 50% and remained at 50 -55% for much of the recent period. \\nThe service sector  continued to grow faster than GDP until FY2010 (Table 3.2), when its GDP share \\nreached 55%. The growth has now slowed slightly below the pace of GDP growth.  Consequently, the GDP \\nshare of service sector  is declining and has fallen to 51% in FY2019. Until about 2000, the service s ector  \\nwas largely characterized by informal employment manned by low -skilled labour . Only recently, modern \\nservices are emerging as the more dynamic segment of the service economy. Nevertheless, this 45% \\nincrease in the relative GDP share of services in ab out four decades is a remarkable achievement and has \\nbeen a major contributor to income, employment and poverty reduction.  \\nTable 3.2: Decadal Growth Rates of GDP and Services  \\nAverage Growth Rates  FY74 -80 FY81 -90 FY91 -00 FY01 -10 FY11 -19 \\nServices  3.2 3.8 4.5 6.1 6.2 \\nGDP  2.9 3.5 4.7 5.9 6.9 \\nSource: GED estimates based on BBS data  \\n The decadal growth record of Bangladesh’s service sector  is impressive and can be viewed in the context \\nof W.W. Rostow’s well -known “Stages of Economic Growth” hypothesis about the path to growth take -\\noff. Rostow’s (1960) stages hypothesized that a poor agrarian economy initially moves to a path of growth \\ntake-off based on the strength of the industrial sector and then eventually when it achieves self -sustained \\ngrowth the role of  service sector  expands. Bangladesh followed a slightly different route in the sense that \\nthe service sector  played a stronger role than the industrial sector in the early stages of development. As a \\nresult, the share of services value -added in total GDP i s higher than the average for the low -income \\neconomies (Figure 3.2).  \\n3.3.2  Employment  Generation in Services  \\nWhereas informal employment in rural and urban services provided the initial cushion for employment \\nabsorption, as rural agriculture released surpl us labour , in subsequent years labour  absorption occurred in \\nmore modern services (in addition to industry) as the service sector  underwent structural change over time. \\nFig.3.5 presents the historical evolution of service sector  employment contribution vis -à-vis agriculture and \\nindustry. Implications of this transformation are  the subject of discussion in Section 3.6.  \\nSurplus agriculture labour initially moved to a range of rural and urban services in trade, transport and \\npersonal services. Thus, the emplo yment shares  of services surged from 15% in FY1974 to 34% in FY1990.  \\nIt has continued to grow somewhat faster than total employment since then, although the pace was \\nconsiderably less rapid than during the FY1974 -FY1990 period. A part of the slowdown serv ice sector \\nemployment growth post FY1990 is explained by the RMG revolution that gained momentum during the \\n1990s. But another contributing factor was external migration, particularly to Middle Eastern Countries   \\n \\n244 \\n (Figure 3.6). Along with internal migration to urban sector jobs, the external job creation through migration \\nhas been a major contributor to the tightening of labour market in the rural economy and resultant increases \\nin agricultural wages.  \\nFigure 3.5: Share of Services in Employment  \\n \\nSource: Ban gladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\nFigure 3.6: Annual Outflow of Migrant Workers  \\n \\nSource: Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET)  \\n3.3.3  Rural Transformation  through  Accelerated Non -Farm Service  \\nBangladesh rural economy has undergone profound tr ansformational change compared to its state in the \\n1970s. Growth of informal and formal service activities in the rural areas have been a source as well as \\nconsequence of this rural transformation. Rural poverty has declined substantially; life expectancy and adult \\nliteracy has improved significantly. The substantial improvements in the fundamental indicators of well -\\nbeing of the rural population were also accompanied by explosive growth of activities that fall within the \\nambit of formal or informal service s: enhancements in the quality of life in terms of quality of dwelling, 77\\n61\\n53 5147\\n40\\n812 13 131620152734 36 3740\\n020406080100\\n1974 1980 1990 2000 2010 2019% of Total Employment\\nAgriculture Industry Service\\n0200,000400,000600,000800,0001,000,0001,200,000\\n1993-94\\n1994-95\\n1995-96\\n1996-97\\n1997-98\\n1998-99\\n1999-00\\n2000-01\\n2001-02\\n2002-03\\n2003-04\\n2004-05\\n2005-06\\n2006-07\\n2007-08\\n2008-09\\n2009-10\\n2010-11\\n2011-12\\n2012-13\\n2013-14\\n2014-15\\n2015-16\\n2016-17\\n2017-18\\n2018-19Number of Workers\\nYear  \\n \\n245 \\n access to safe water, access to sanitary facilities, access to electricity, access to rural roads, access to \\ntelephone, access to internet, better health and nutrition services and facilities and growing education of \\nrural children at the primary and secondary level.   \\nAlong with social progress, the sources of income have changed dramatically.  Agriculture is no longer the \\ndominant source of income. The rural households now draw a subs tantially larger proportion of their \\nincome from non -agricultural activities and transfers, mainly from foreign migrant workers.  The effects of \\ngrowing demand for services in the rural economy financed by the remittance and non -farm income is \\nadding a new  dimension to employment opportunities for services in rural areas.  The observed \\nimprovement in the quality of life of the rural population in terms of housing, rural infrastructure, health , \\nnutrition  and education is an example of the growing demand for services. The expansion in rural \\nelectrification, cell phone and internet services are also changing the economic and social character of the \\nrural population.  \\nFertility decline and growth of food production explain the developments in rural Bangladesh bet ween 1972 \\nand 2000 quite well. From 2000 onwards, other dynamic factors have started playing a more dominant role \\nin changing the rural landscape. To appreciate their role, it is instructive to look at the sources of rural \\nhousehold income (Table 3.3). HIE S Data suggest that even as late as 1991 farming accounted for some 53 \\npercent of rural household income. By 2010, this share had fallen dramatically to only 30 percent, whereas \\nthe share of non -agricultural income surged from 36 percent to 53 percent (BBS  2010). The other important \\nand growing contributor is total transfers from domestic and foreign sources, which expanded from 11 \\npercent in 1991 to 17 percent in 2010.  Much of this transfer is accounted for by the contribution from \\nforeign remittance.  Although the relative importance of transfers fell in 2016, they have continued to play \\na major role in rural incomes.  \\nTable 3.3: Sources of Rural Household Income (Percent)  \\nYear  Total Household Income  Agriculture  Non-Agriculture  Transfers  \\n(Remittance)  \\n1991 /92 100 40 49 11 \\n1995/96  100 35 55 10 \\n2000  100 26 63 11 \\n2005  100 29 59 12 \\n2010  100 30 53 17 \\n2016  100 19 69 12 \\nSource: BBS, HIES (various years)  \\nThese changing income trends suggest a huge economic transformation of the rural economy as non -\\nfarming ac tivities have corroborated the developments in national accounts that show that as compared with \\nagriculture, which grew by an average of 3.4 per  cent during FY1992 -FY2010, manufacturing grew by 7.3  \\nper cent   While the income from farming tends to be more equalizing than income from non -farming and \\ntransfers, once the general equilibrium effects of growing demand for services in the rural economy \\nfinanced by the remittance and non -farm income is considered, the most likely beneficiary of this is the \\nrural w age earners, who tend to belong to the poorest income group. The observed improvement in the \\nquality of life of the rural population in terms of housing, rural infrastructure, health , nutrition  and education \\nis an example of the growing demand for services .    \\n \\n246 \\n The expansion in rural electrification, cell phone services and internet services are also changing the \\neconomic and social character of the rural population. Better communications along with improvement in \\nrural transport has lowered the transaction co sts between the rural and the urban centres, thereby facilitating \\nthe expansion of trade and commerce. The expansion of ICT services to the rural economy is slowly but \\nsurely reducing the information gap between the urban market centres and rural productio n points and also \\nhelping improve production technology. Additionally, the expansion of mobile financial services is \\nchanging the payments options. Both are helping reduce cost and secure better returns to rural \\nentrepreneurs.   It is pertinent to note here  that despite progress in expansion of ICT services in rural areas, \\nthe digital divide between urban and rural areas still exists. The 8FYP envisions bridging  the gap.  \\n3.3.4  Growing Export  Earnings from Factor and Non -Factor Services  \\nTraditionally speaking , apart from such services as international shipping and air transportation, most \\nservices activities are considered non -traded. But evolution of international trade and the rise of embedded \\ndigital services in merchandise trade has brought a lot of servic e activities in the tradable category. As \\ncross -border flows of digital information rise by leaps and bounds, more and more service activities which \\nwere considered non -tradable now have become tradable (e.g. printing, advertising, back -office \\nprocessing).  Though, by and large, services represent non -traded activities, it is possible to think of export \\nand import of many types of services.  \\nService exports from Bangladesh could be divided into factor - and non -factor services. The EPB now \\npublishes regular mo nthly statement of non -factor services export, as a complement to the data on \\nmerchandise exports. Remittance of migrant workers constitutes  export of factor services. These services \\nare provided under Mode 4 of WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services  (GATS). In the Bangladesh \\ncontext, export of both factor and non -factor services generate significant amount of foreign exchange \\nearnings to keep the current account of the balance of payments in sustainable range. Remittance inflows, \\nwhich reached $17.5 billion in FY2020 (despite massive layoffs of migrant workers in the Middle East due \\nto Covid19 related shock), have been a bulwark in propping up our foreign exchange reserves to record \\nlevels. Remittances make up as much as 6% of GDP and are the second l argest source of foreign exchange \\nearnings after RMG’s 13%. Bangladesh also earns a fair amount of foreign exchange from a range of Non -\\nFactor Services (NFS), such as shipping, air transport, insurance, tourism,  IT and peace -keeping services. \\nIt is worth m entioning that IT sector export is growing over time. The export of IT service reached 265.17 \\nmillion US$ in FY2020, which was 191.84 million US$ in FY2017.  The trend in these sources of export \\nearnings is illustrated in Figure 3. 7.  \\nExport of workers and related remittance inflows took off in a big way after FY1990. Other service exports \\nhave also shown some upward movement, but income from remittance inflows has dwarfed the contribution \\nfrom other services. Remittance inflows reached a peak of $1 8 billion  in FY2020 growing by an annual \\naverage rate of about 1 1% in nominal dollar terms between FY1990 and FY2020 . Other service export \\nincome also grew significantly although at a more modest pace of 8% per year.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n247 \\n Figure 3.7: Trend in Factor and Non -Factor Se rvice Exports  \\n \\n             Source: Bangladesh Bank  \\nIncome from remittances (factor services) and other services is a major source of foreign exchange earnings \\nand an important driver of GDP growth. Before the emergence of ready -made garments (RMG), fact or and \\nnon-factor services were the largest source of FE earnings (Figure 3.8).  This dominance prevailed even \\nafter the arrival of RMG well until FY2010.  The relative role of remittances and other service earnings has \\nfallen considerably since then, owin g to acceleration of RMG exports, a slowdown in the growth of \\nremittance and  the inability of non -factor services to grow fast .  So, the total export earnings from services \\nas a share of GDP fell from a peak of 12.2% in FY2010 to only 7.4% in FY2019 (Figur e 3.9).  Nevertheless,  \\nthey still constitute the second largest source of foreign exchange earnings after RMG, accounting for 35% \\nof total foreign  exchange earnings in FY2019.   \\nFigure 3.8: Value of Services Exports  \\n \\nSources: Bangladesh Bank and the World  Bank  0.20.82.21118\\n0.2 0.30.92.56.8\\n0.41.13.113.524.8\\n051015202530\\nFY1980 FY1990 FY2000 FY2010 FY2020US DOLLAR BILLIONSRemittances NFS Total Services\\n14132634\\n1 146 6\\n14141922\\n0510152025303540\\n1990 2000 2010 2015 2019US$ Billion\\nRMG Non-RMG Services  \\n \\n248 \\n Figure 3.9: Earnings from Services Exports as % of GDP  \\n \\nSources: Bangladesh Bank and the World Bank  \\nThe solid contribution of service sector  to export earnings is self -evident.  The challenge moving forward \\nis how the recent decline in service expor t earnings can be reversed and its historical dynamic role preserved \\nand further expanded, especially focused on NFS.  Unlike earnings from factor services that are largely \\nexogenous to Bangladesh because they depend upon immigration policies of host count ries (i.e. Mode 4 of \\nGATS), earning potential from NFS is substantial. The global market for NFS is large and Bangladesh is a \\nrelatively small player.  With proper policies it should be possible to capture a larger share on the global \\nNFS market.  \\n3.4 HARNESSIN G REMITTANCE FLOWS FOR DEVELOPMENT  \\nRemittance, the income and savings of migrant workers, is unquestionably a strong driver of growth via its \\nimpact on consumption and investment spending as well as its singular contribution to Bangladesh’s \\nsustainable cur rent account balance in the wake of rising demand of foreign exchange for import of goods \\nand services to meet development requirements.  \\nRemittance inflows arise from export of factor services. After merchandise exports, remittance inflows \\nmake up the sec ond largest foreign exchange source for Bangladesh. Migrant workers (under Mode 4 of \\nGATS) and their remittances have played a pivotal role in reducing poverty as well as fuelling  growth in \\nBangladesh. As the labour  force grows in si ze, a good number is  finding temporary work abroad , mostly in \\nthe Middle Eastern countries and also elsewhere. In the past three years (FY17 -19) the number of migrant \\ndepartures ranged from 700,000 to 1 million. The Ministry of Expatriate’s Welfare and Employment \\nestimates that 12% of our labour  force (about 8 million) of 65 million is  employed abroad. One estimate by \\nthe RMMRU (Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit) puts the current stock of Bangladeshi \\nmigrants worldwide at 11.5 million.  \\nAfter RMG exports, remittances bring home the maximum amount of foreign exchange, rising to US$16.4 \\nbillion in FY19 or 5.4% of GDP (Table 3.4). Despite the COVOD -19 pandemic, the remittance inflows \\nperformed remarkably well in FY2020.

On the whole, remittances grew by a solid 10.8% in \\nFY2020 from FY2019.  There are , however , reports of loss of overseas jobs and a slowdown in the departure \\nof new overseas workers owing to CO VID-19.  It is expected that overseas job market will recover in 2021.  \\nThe government is also making an effort to restore the momentum of overseas jobs . \\nTable 3.4: Bangladesh Remittance Inflow s \\nYear  Remittance Inflow (US $ Millions)  Remittance Growth (%)  \\n2009  9689   \\n2010  10987  13% \\n2011  11650  6% \\n2012  12843  10% \\n2013  14461  13% \\n2014  14228  0% \\n2015  15317  8% \\n2016  14931  -3% \\n2017  12769  -14% \\n2018  14982  17% \\n2019  \\n 16420  \\n 10% \\n 2020  18205  11% \\nSource:  Bangladesh Bank  \\nCross -country research evidence confirms that remittances from migrants have positive impacts on poverty \\nreduction and development in originating countries, mostly developing ones, substantially contributing to \\nthe achievement of development goals. These positive impacts become greater when remit tances can be \\nsaved and invested in infrastructures and productive capacity. Government policy mea sures could induce \\nsuch use. S ignificant barriers to migration and remittance transfers in Bangladesh need to be addressed in \\norder to harness opportunities f or de velopment and poverty reduction  including through easing financial \\ntransfers, setting appropriate incentives, improving policy coherence in migrati on and facilitating the \\ntemporary movement of people.  \\nThe poverty reduction impact of remittances is sub stantial, as they are, in many cases, directly received by \\nthe poor households, augmenting their income and alleviating their poverty. Remittances have proved to be \\na more stable source of poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Such flows could last for one gene ration or more, \\nand usually go to more or less the same family members or families in the same local neighbourhood  within \\ndistricts.  \\nRemittances have also played an essential role in smoothing impacts of devastating natural disasters. \\nInternational aid an d private philanthropic support may be useful in the initial phase of reconstruction; \\nhowever, this aid cannot be long -lasting. Remittances and other supports from migrants abroad play a more \\neffective role in the post -disaster recovery and rehabilitation in Bangladesh.  \\nThough not the most productive use of remittances, they have driven consumption spending in a big way \\nparticularly in the rural areas. The multiplier effect stems from the purchase of essential goods and services, \\nhome appliances, and medic al and education services. Most of the goods and services consumed (mostly \\nutilities and financial services) are produced locally, except for home appliances with a high level of   \\n \\n250 \\n imported component. Such consumption increases the local demand, particularly  in poor or rural areas, \\nthereby driving domestic production.  \\nWhen remittances are converted into investible resources, they have stronger multiplier effects with a major \\nimpact on the overall economy. When a share of remittances is used for small business  investments, the \\nmultiplier effect becomes larger and more sustainable as they create income stream. On average, around 10 \\nper cent of remittances are found to be saved and invested. Evidence shows that remittances help to increase \\nthe level of small busi ness activities in the country as they are key sources of finance for investment in \\nfarming and other off -farm small and medium enterprises. Remittances have helped small local \\nentrepreneurs bypass inefficient or non -existent local credit markets, especial ly in rural areas, and to start \\nproductive activities. To get the most developmental outcome from remittances, one goal of the 8FYP will \\nbe to channel remittances as a source of development finance to support development and poverty \\nreduction, including th e building of local infrastructure, expansion of CMSMEs, and augmenting \\nproductive capacity.  \\nSteady flows of remittances from migrants have had important stabilizing effects on the balance of \\npayments. Despite chronic trade deficits, the current account ba lance of Bangladesh has turned positive \\nwith the rise of remittances. Remittances have contributed significantly to the sustainability of our external \\nbalance with accumulation of foreign exchange reserves of $33 billion by end of FY2019.  \\nSuch funds also improve a country’s creditworthiness for external borrowing. Remittances create the scope \\nfor introducing diaspora bonds which could be used as an innovative tool for development financing by \\ntapping into the wealth of a diaspora population and opening new  marketing channels. India was the first \\ndeveloping country to issue diaspora bonds during the economic crisis in 1991, when it experienced a large \\ntrade and fiscal deficit, high inflation and devaluation of the Indian rupee. The Indian Development Bo nds \\ntargeted at Indian diaspora  enabled India to raise $1.6 billion in a short period of time, which was critical \\nto India’s recovery from the crisis.  \\nDepending on whether the lion’s share of remittance is used for consumption purposes or investment, the \\neffect  and longevity of poverty alleviation and development effects vary accordingly. Research on the effect \\nof remittance shows that while remittance used on consumption has short -term effects and can induce \\ninequality, remittance used for investment has a last ing and more equalizing effect on income. It is argued \\nthat any form of spending, whether it is consumption or investment, will bring about a series of economic \\ntransactions, spurring demand for goods and services and more growth eventually. Moreover, cons umption \\nspending on human capital, education , healthcare and better nutrition also has a long-term influence on \\npoverty reduction.  \\nRemittance investment and the multiplier effect : The bulk of remittances in Bangladesh, up to 80 percent, \\nare spent on consum ption and welfare, while only a small amount is invested in land, housing, or new \\nproductive investments. Clearly, expenditure on land and housing creates employment, as does spending \\nfor consumption, education, and welfare. However, it has been found that  for the long -term economic \\ngrowth of a community, new productive investment is the critical factor. When a share of remittance is used \\neven for small business investments, the multiplier effect becomes larger and more sustainable as they \\ncreate income str eam. Remittance recipient households are known to use them as key sources of finance \\nfor investment in farming. Providing financial counselling to remittance recipients could help to mobilize   \\n \\n251 \\n their savings into the financial sector, which could then be uti lized for credit to enhance the country’s \\nproductive base. Remittances are an attractive source of funding for local entrepreneurs because of its easy \\naccess and especially because they can circumvent any barriers to local credit market access due to \\nineff icient practices and complexities.  \\nIt is fair to conclude that remittance has not only helped Bangladesh earn valuable foreign currency but it \\nhas also had the effect of raising its economic growth. For this reason,  it will be important to take \\nappropriat e policy measures to keep the inflow of remittances on a higher growth trajectory.  The volume \\nand effectiveness of remittances, however, depend on factors like the type of workers going abroad (skilled \\nor unskilled), ease of transferring money from abroad  to home (i.e. official channels through which money \\nis remitted) and how much is actually used for enhancement of society’s welfare. Large portions of \\nremittance move through informal channels and is never reported. To make the best use of these funds, \\npooling and redirecting them to such areas as microenterprise or infrastructure development, or human \\ncapital development, would yield the highest dividends for the country.  \\nRemittance and Exports – twin sources of development finance : It is important to co nsider the impact of \\nthe two medium of foreign exchange earnings for Bangladesh that started to show promise since the 1990s. \\nTogether they account for 20% of GDP, driving consumption, investment and job creation. The chronic \\ntrade deficits resulting from the import -dependent development programmes  that arguably involves rising \\nimports of machinery, capital goods, and industrial raw materials, has been regularly offset by consistently \\nrising remittance inflows to yield current account surpluses for 13 of th e last 20 years. For a rapidly \\ndeveloping economy with enormous requirement for investment current account surplus indicate paucity \\nof investment relative to national savings. During the 7FYP, the implementation of several mega projects \\n(e.g. Padma Multi -purpose Bridge Project , Rooppur Nuclear Power Project, Rampal Coal Based Power \\nProject, Chattogram -Dohajari to Ramu -Cox’s Bazar and Ramu -Gundum Railway Construction Project, \\nDhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project) t hat required massive imports of heav y machinery and \\nequipment, has now tipped the external balance towards negative current account which thus far has been \\nfinanced largely through remittances, merchandise exports, concessional aid, supplier’s credit, and other \\nloans. But the good side of cu rrent account deficits is that it signifies excess of investment over national \\nsavings, indicating that we are finally displaying an appetite for meeting the yawning infrastructure gap \\nthat, once bridged, will yield enormous returns in terms of growth over  the medium and long -term.  \\nThe bottom line is that for planning purposes exports combined with remittances now make up the principal \\nsource of development finance with official development assistance  (ODA) playing a much smaller (albeit \\ncritical) role.  \\nCross-coun try research on remittances has  identified ways to ensure that remittances are used in an effective \\nmanner which will contribute to the country’s welfare. Strategies under the 8FYP  will explore some of \\nthese for implementation:  \\n\\uf0b7 Encouraging wallet -to-wallet  remittance flows with cash transfers in increasing  saving by \\nrecipients (and senders)  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving investment climate by reducing red tape and other complexities will encourage \\nrecipients to use remittance money for investment purposes, whose effe ct is more long lasting and \\nless volatile than that of consumption    \\n \\n252 \\n \\uf0b7 Weaknesses in the financial sector and in government administration impose substantial transaction \\ncosts on migrant workers; therefore, these issues should be addressed so that transaction costs are \\nminimized. Evidence suggests that inefficiencies in the banking system —long delays in check \\nclearance, exchange losses, or improper disclosure of transactions costs dissuades inward \\nremittances  \\n\\uf0b7 Improvements in banking sector technology could ensu re a smoother, quicker and more transparent \\nmoney transfer system  \\n\\uf0b7 Remittance impact could be maximized by establishing partnerships between leading banks and the \\ngovernment post office network in countries that do not have access to banking services in rur al areas  \\n\\uf0b7 Collecting remittance data and analysing  them could help formulate policy actions in favour of \\nremittance inflow. In order to do so, a better understanding must grow amongst key policy makers, \\nregulatory bodies, financial service providers and mig rant groups so that assessments on flows, \\nmigration patterns, technology and other motivations can be made  \\n\\uf0b7 Regulations must be eased so that there’s a wider range of financial products available to low -\\nincome migrant households.  \\n \\n3.5 OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT STRAT EGY FOR THE 8FYP  \\nOver the past decade, the Ministry of Expatriate’s Welfare and Employment has taken the lead in paying \\nincreasing attention to the welfare of migrant workers and effective use of remittance inflows. A systematic \\njourney towards building a robust system to take care of overseas employment and well -being of migrant \\nworkers started with enactment of ‘Overseas Employment and Migrants Act 2013’ followed by the \\nadoption of a number of important legal instruments (Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas  Employment \\nPolicy 2016, Labour Migration Management Rules 2017, Wage Earners’ Welfare Board Act 2018, Policy \\nGuidelines for Mandatory Insurance for Migrant Workers 2019, CIP Guidelines for Recruitment Agencies \\n2019). Bangladesh Bureau of Manpower Employme nt and Training (BMET) now track  every worker who \\nwent abroad. However, there is no system in place yet to track returnee migrants, thus services for returnee \\nmigrants remain largely unutilized. The Wage Earners’ Welfare Board (WEWB) introduced an Enterpri se \\nResource Planning (ERP) system, which allows to process services for migrant workers.  \\nImportant lessons have been learnt from past experience:  \\n\\uf0b7 Bangladesh has been experiencing  strong  growth in the overseas employment and migration sector. \\nThere is conf idence among the stakeholders that a big push can improve the scenario further and \\noverseas employment and migration can play further substantive  development role , beyond just \\ncounting remittance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Decentralization of migration governance proved to be effe ctive by reducing hassles and cost for \\nmigrants. The decentralization needs to be continued and DMEOs need to be established in all \\ndistricts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Along with the decentralization of migration governance, the decentralization of training facilities \\nalso improv ed training capability of BMET. Each Upazila should have a training facility in \\ncoordination with BTEB.    \\n \\n253 \\n \\uf0b7 The ability of PKB to function properly to serve the needs of the Migrant workers requires \\ninnovation, service and product diversification for various stages of migration, service to the \\nfamilies of the migrants and bringing commercial principles of operation.  \\n3.5.1  Development Vision, Objectives and Agenda for 8FYP  \\nThe development vision, objectives and agenda for 8FYP of overseas employment and migrat ion sector are \\ndrawn from the Vision  2041,  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs), International Labour Standard \\n(ILS) and Conventions;  Global Compact for Migration (GCM), and Other  national  and international  \\ncommitments  and the Action  Plan of the Policy.  \\nVision \\nHaving decent employment opportunities (both national and international) with dignity and protection of \\nrights for every citizen, where overseas employment and migration contribute to national economic and \\nsocial development.  \\nObjectives  \\n\\uf0b7 Make a paradi gm shift in the overseas employment and migration framework so that it becomes an \\nimportant strategy of poverty and unemployment reduction, macroeconomic stability and well -\\nbeing of every citizen of the country;  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote zero migration stance until the dig nity, fairness, freedom, security and human rights of all \\nBangladeshi expatriates, especially for women migrants, are ensured;  \\n\\uf0b7 Make Bangladesh a preferred source of manpower in addressing critical developmental needs of \\ncountries around the globe;  \\n\\uf0b7 Attach h ighest importance to developing skills responsive to the needs in international labour \\nmarket.  \\n\\uf0b7 Achieve low- cost migration for Bangladeshi citizens through concerted efforts of Ministries and \\nagencies in the country as well as working along with regional a nd global stakeholders;  \\n\\uf0b7 Make overseas employment and return of Bangladeshi citizens, after contributing to Bangladesh \\neconomy and economy of host countries, safe, assured and protected.  \\n\\uf0b7 Make sure that return of the migrants is ensured through sustainable social and economic \\nreintegration.  \\nBig Agenda of Paradigm Shift in overseas employment  \\nMerchandise exports crossed USD 40 billion in FY2019, contributing to macro -economic stability and jobs \\nat home. Remittance inflows of $16.4 billion brought in the secon d largest amount of foreign exchange. \\nProper harnessing of overseas employment and ensuring well -being of migrant’s  workers could produce \\nfar-reaching results for the economy and society reaping the benefits of demographic dividends, addressing \\nthe challen ges of ‘job -less growth’, as well as contributing top macroeconomic stability. A declaration of \\ndecade of “overseas employment diplomacy” may be a cornerstone of the paradigm shift. During the period   \\n \\n254 \\n of 8FYP, roughly 1.5 million will be added to the workfo rce every year. Building on past experience, 50% \\nof this additional labour  force could be employed overseas by effective harnessing of overseas employment \\nopportunities.  \\n‘Ethical recruitment’ and ‘empathy’ will be two key parameters for this mind -set shift agenda. All \\ncurriculum and training of related stakeholders, both public and private sector will focus on the two \\nparameters.  \\nFor shifting the paradigm, we need to re -look at the term ‘labour’, which gives the perception of low -\\nskilled workers. As the p aradigm shift agenda includes overseas employment of higher skills categories, \\nwith higher educational qualification and socio -economic status, it is apparent that the existing \\nadministrative arrangement is not equipped to facilitate migration of a skilled  university graduates. The \\nparadigm shift will include an agenda of institutional reform, which can cater to the need of potential \\nemployees of all sections of the society.  \\nOverseas Employment and Well -being of Migrant Workers: A 10 Point Agenda for 8FYP  \\n1. Institutional and Legal Reform and Capacity Enhancement: The first thing required for a \\nparadigm shift is strong institutions with adequate capacity. Among the three major building blocks of \\nmigration, pre -departure, employment  at destination countries and  return, there is no policy framework to \\nfacilitate adequate provisioning of services for returnee migrants. The Ministry will initiate adoption of a \\n‘Sustainable Reintegration of Migrant Workers Policy’. The Ministry will expedite adoption of a ‘Rules \\nfor Wage Earner’s Welfare Board Act 2018’, so that benefits of provisions for migrant workers reach them.  \\nThe agenda for comprehensive institutional reform include:  \\n\\uf0b7 BMET will have to be raised to a Full -fledged department.  \\n\\uf0b7 One of the major action points fo r the Ministry during the period of 8FYP will be mapping the \\nactivities o f these two key institutions  reduc ing overlap in mandate and activities and ensuring \\nappropriate integration of activities in the migration continuum. The responsibility of coordinati on \\nwill be with the Ministry with an integrated digital service management.  \\n\\uf0b7 To address the vacuum in research and analytical capacity to understand labour market dynamics \\nin existing and new destination countries, a new Centre for Research on Labour Migra tion will be \\nestablished linked with the Research Wing of the Ministry with a similar status in BIDS or BIISS. \\nThe Ministry will also establish a Labour Market Research Unit (LMRU) inside BMET.  \\n\\uf0b7 The era of migration diplomacy has arrived. Economic diplomac y has evolved into trade \\ndiplomacy in the 1990s and 2000s and Bangladesh was able to reap the benefit for such foreign \\npolicy reorientation. Without reducing focus on trade diplomacy, Bangladesh will be able to reap \\nthe benefit of foreign employment market  through ‘overseas employment diplomacy’. This will \\nrequire significant capacity enhancement of and coordination between the MoEWE and MOFA. \\nBesides, Bangladesh also needs to explore markets of the Central Asian and South -East Asian \\ncountries for exporting  its products. To address this issue effectively, the Ministry of Finance, \\nMinistry of Commerce and Ministry of Industries  can be brought into a cluster to promote the \\neconomic diplomacy. Ministry of Foreign Affairs should help in this endeavour . BIDA, BEZ A,   \\n \\n255 \\n BEPZA and BHTPA can work with this cluster to attract the FDI in Bangladesh, and thus ensure \\nemployment, industrialization, export diversification and so on.  \\n\\uf0b7 In connection with reduction of cost of migration and reducing harassment of labour migrants, \\nDistrict Employment and Manpower Offices (DEMO) were established and a number of pre -\\ndeparture processes were decentralized. In line with the strategy of sending at least  1,000 citizens \\nfrom each Upazi la, the Ministry will establish DEMOs in all uncovered d istricts, and increase \\ncapacity of the offices at migration -prone districts the facilities of registration and smart card \\ndistribution will be developed in all 64 districts. Scope of work for the DEMOs need to be outlined \\nto ensure effective migration, emp loyment and reintegration facilitation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Currently, 64 Technical Training Centres (TTC) and 6 Institute of Marine Technologies (IMT) are \\nin operation and 70 more are under process of establishment. During 8FYP all Upazila  will have \\nTTCs. This expansion will  provide appropriate and adequate training to potential migrant without \\nleaving station.  \\n2. Market Expansion and Economic Contribution: Current overseas employment is limited to 20 \\ncountries on a regular basis with other countries arising occasionally. The m arket expanded from about 2.6 \\nmillion during the 6FYP  period to nearly 8 million at the end of 7FYP  period.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will target at least 5 million new workforces  for facilitating migration abroad in \\n8FYP, with minimum 50% in higher skilled categorie s. The Ministry will target 20 new countries \\nin 4 new geographic regions. The Ministry will target reaching USD 150 Billion of remittance in \\n8FYP period, with an average remittance income of USD 30 Billion per year.  \\n\\uf0b7 For reaching the target, the Ministry w ill launch an ‘Overseas employment market expansion road -\\nmap’ by a new ‘Market Expansion Task -force’, combining all relevant Ministries and agencies.  \\n3. Skills Development: To achieve these positive outcomes of skills development and qualification \\nrecognitio n of migrant workers, a National Action Plan for Skills Development and Migration Management \\nhas been developed. The aim of the action plan is to guide skills development initiatives in line with the \\nNational Skills Development Policy 2011, while also main taining effective coordination with other skills \\ndevelopment stakeholders.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will take initiative during this period to work with National Skills Development \\nAuthority (NSDA) and Bangladesh Technical Education Board  and Future of Work Lab .  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will establish one TTC in every Upazila  by 2025, which will allow potential migrants \\nto go for longer training outside of their home.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will initiate in association with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant \\nentities pursu ing international accreditation of certification of skills and mutual recognition of \\nskills for at least 20 countries by the end of 8FYP period.    \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will develop a ‘Policy for Skills Classification for Migration’ to replace the \\ntraditional 4 le vel category (Less -Skilled, Semi -Skilled, Skilled and Professional) to new \\ncompetency -based grading system (NTVQF).  The Ministry will also upgrade BMET occupational \\ndatabase by re -classifying migrants in terms of the new classification system. Annual revi ew will \\nbe conducted in COD to establish realistic wage rates and differentials for skilled workers.    \\n \\n256 \\n \\uf0b7 The Ministry will introduce skills competency assessment and certification as a new precondition \\nfor the issuing of Smart Card exit permit. It will establi sh Assessment Centres for outward migrant \\nworkers with international accreditation.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will work closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to induct Skills Recognition \\nof Bangladesh TVET qualifications in COD’s.  \\n4. Access to Service  \\n\\uf0b7 The 8FYP will  introduce seamless one -stop-service for the potential migrants by integration of \\nphysical and digital infrastructure.  \\n\\uf0b7 The 8FYP will expand the capacity of the grievance management system integrating with national \\ngrievance management. The system will be seamlessly integrated with relevant institutions at home \\nand in destination countries, including Bangladesh Missions.   \\n\\uf0b7 Access to Information is the key for making informed decision for migration. The Ministry will \\ndevelop a communication strategy on skills  training & NTVQF qualification and better -quality  \\ninformation on safe migration for aspiring migrants.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will initiate private -public partnership in the areas of access to services for migrant \\nworkers at home and abroad with a provision of qual ity control and engaging expatriate \\nBangladeshi professionals.  \\n\\uf0b7 A number of programmes  were implemented with support from development partners, including \\ncall centre, grievances management system.  The Ministry will mainstream services under those \\nprogramme s/projects through public -private partnership, engaging Office of the Public -Private \\nPartnership at Prime Minister’s Office.  \\n5. Access to Finance  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will work closely with the PKB to remove all bottlenecks, including expanding the \\nbranch network in cluding agent banking outlets in each Upazila . The PKB will introduce digital \\nbanking and banking services to families of migrant workers with a whole range of products as \\nlike as any other commercial banks, for making the bank reachable to majority of the  migrant \\nworkers.  \\n\\uf0b7 The government has also introduced a very progressive system of 2% cash incentive to the migrant \\nworkers for sending their remittance through regular channel. As a result of that the remittance \\nflow through legal channel has increased. T he government has introduced insurance service for \\nmigrant workers and their family members. The coverage and time length of  insurance service  will \\nbe increased during the 8FYP.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will take comprehensive plan to promote financial literacy and r emittance \\nmanagement training for migrants at the pre -departure stage. The Ministry will lead activities to \\nensure migrant’s families are well aware about the gainful utilization of remittance.  \\n   \\n \\n257 \\n 6. Protection, Rights and Well -being  \\n\\uf0b7 The Bangladesh Constituti on ensures protection of every citizen from abuse and torture, be it at \\nhome and abroad (Article 35(5) of the Constitution of Bangladesh), as a signatory of the \\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of \\nTheir Families 1990, the Overseas Employment and Migration Act 2013, and the Expatriates’ \\nWelfare and Overseas Employment Policy 2016, ensures execution of those commitments. During \\nthe 8FYP, Ministry will allocate resources for strengthening institutional  capacity for ensuring \\nprotection, rights and well -being of migrant workers, especially women migrants.  \\n\\uf0b7 One of the specific measures is engaging non -resident Bangladeshi specialists to support new \\nmigrants and migrants facing trouble in destination countr ies in terms of legal protection and \\nmental health. The Ministry will launch a comprehensive programme in collaboration with the \\nprivate sector and NGOs for ensuring mental health support during their stay abroad and after \\nreturn.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will explor e scope of introduction of a package of support for returning migrant \\nworkers (including entrepreneurial skills training, job placement and skills assessment) to assist \\ntheir reintegration  into the domestic labour market.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will explore the scop e of introduction of International Recruitment Integrity System \\n(IRIS) for encouraging private sector recruiting agencies at home and destination countries \\npracticing  fair recruitment to reduce excessive cost of migration as well as protection of rights of  \\nmigrants.  \\n\\uf0b7 While Bangladesh’s strategy will be to explore new markets and facilitating migration with higher \\nskills, Bangladesh will take a stance of ‘no migration’, unless a minimum set of criteria is fulfilled \\nin terms of wage, rights and protection, in  line with international conventions.  \\n7. Digitization  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will initiate mapping of all existing services and assess the effectiveness and \\nadequacy. By 2025, the whole migration process will be digitized with a very simple user interface \\nfor migrant workers.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will develop a labour migration data strategy, which will facilitate all relevant \\nMinistries, Agencies at home and abroad to share data to better strategize and provide services to \\nmigrant workers as well as better protection. One exa mple of what data strategy may include is \\nintroduction of a centralised electronic management information system (CMIS) for capturing data \\non all trainees of BMET, TTCs, other ministries and departments providing skills training, dis -\\naggregated by course l evel, course type, course name, institution, district and gender and \\nassessment results.  The MIS would be helpful for skills assessment and efforts of accreditation \\nand mutual recognition.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will launch e -learning programmes , with appropriate design so that migrant workers \\nget refreshers for their skills with support distance -based learning  \\n   \\n \\n258 \\n 8. Private Sector and Stakeholders Engagement  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will undertake project for further streamlining the process of migration with \\noptimization of enga gement of intermediaries, by launching an accountability framework for \\nintermediary. The outcome of the project will allow reducing  the cost  of migration.  \\n\\uf0b7 Recognizing that the private  sector is the main vehicle for overseas migration, the Ministry will \\nform a technical committee for coordination of implementation of action plan so that activities, \\nprogrammes  and projects complement in terms capacity and specialization, rather than compete  \\nwith each other.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will lead and take effective initiati ve and programmes to include the private sector \\nin promoting migration of skilled workers, protection rights and ensure gainful migration.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will develop “ethical recruitment” system and monitor BAIRA for implementation.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will take  leadership in mobilizing governments and stakeholders of sending countries \\nand international stakeholders for developing a strategy of ‘zero recruitment cost migration’ \\n(employers pay model) and ‘every citizen’s right matter’ policy for safety and rights of migrant \\nworkers.  \\n9. Cost of Migration  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will undertake a five-year program mes targeting ‘ low recruitment cost migration’ \\nthrough negotiation with employers, recruiting agencies and service providers.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will also increase capacity of  BOESL for accessing new market and expanding \\nexisting market, which will reduce cost of migration and increase competition, through market - \\nbased incentives for reducing cost.  \\n10. Reintegration  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will initiate adoption of a ‘Sustainable Reintegrat ion of Migrant Workers Policy’. \\nThe Ministry will expedite adoption of a ‘Rules for Wage Earner’s Welfare Board Act 2018’, s o \\nthat benefits of provisions for migrant workers reach them. The Ministry will adopt a Standard \\nOperating Procedure (SOP) for retur nee migrant reintegration, especially for female migrants.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will establish an inter -ministerial and inter -agency/department “referral mechanism” \\nfor the sustainable reintegration of the returnee and will develop and implement a package of \\nsuppo rt for returning migrant workers, including social and psychosocial reintegration, \\nentrepreneurial skills training, job placement and skills assessment to assist their reintegration  into \\nthe domestic labour market.  \\n\\uf0b7 During 8FYP, initiatives will be taken to  introduce new mechanism, including the introduction of \\nmandatory deposit schemes for migrant workers, which can be deducted by the remittance \\nreceiving banks and accumulate in the account of migrant workers. The deposit scheme will allow \\nthe returnee migr ant workers to have financial resources to start her/his own venture or a breathing \\nspace for reintegration.    \\n \\n259 \\n \\uf0b7 Capacity building of the DEMOs and WEWB to deliver reintegration services to the returnee \\nmigrants including referral for medical, psychosocial su pport, skills development, economic \\nrehabilitation and financial inclusion.   \\n3.6 DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN THE SERVICE SECTOR  \\nThe past solid performance of the service sector  has played a major development role in creating jobs, \\nincreasing exports, supporting  income and reducing p overty. Nevertheless,  there is substantial scope for \\nfurther strengthening the contribution of this sector to the development of Bangladesh, especially in terms \\nof growth and equity. The quality and productivity of the service sector  must enhance tremendously to \\nprovide the necessary growth and employment support to ensure the successful completion of the aspired \\njourney for Bangladesh from Lower -Middle Income to Upper Middle Income by FY2031 and High Income \\nby FY2041.  \\nThere are a numb er of issues and challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate this journey.  First, \\ndespite some progress with modernizing the service sector , it remains dominated by unorganized activities \\nwhere productivity and incomes are low. Much of the workforc e outside agriculture who are considered \\npoor are engaged in these low -productivity, low -income unorganized services in rural and urban areas. \\nSecond, the skill base of the service sector , although better than in agriculture and manufacturing, is still \\nlow that largely explains the dominance of unorganized, low productivity, low income activities. Third, \\nwhile earnings from export of labour services have done very well, the performance of export earnings from \\nNFS is considerably below potential. Fourth, the  regulatory policies and public institutions for supporting \\nthe expansion of modern services require substantial revisions and upgrading in order to fully exploit the \\nbenefits of a modern and dynamic service sector . \\n3.6.1  The Structure of Service sector  \\nThe structure of service sector  is shown in Table 3.5. Trade is the dominant services activity, growing at a \\nfaster pace than total GDP between FY1974 and FY2010, with its share in GDP reaching 14 percent.  Since \\nthen its GDP share stabilized at around 14%, growing at the same pace as total GDP.  The increasing \\nimportance of trading activities can be gauged from the fact that its GDP share in FY2019 exceeded the \\nGDP share of crop agriculture and forestry combined. The expansion of trading activities has benef itted \\nfrom a flexible and liberal entry/exit business environment of the sector. The investment requirements are \\nrelatively low and flexible because scale can be adjusted easily to fit the available financing. Trading is a \\nmajor source of rural non -farm em ployment and income.  \\nAn important though informal component of service sector  is the large range of personal and community \\nservices. Its GDP share climbed from 6.2 percent in FY1974 to a high of 11.1% in FY2010, before falling \\ndown to 8.2 percent in FY201 9. The expansion of personal services benefitted from the generous inflow of \\nremittances. The demand for a range of personal services including chauffeurs, plumbers, shoe -repair, \\ninformal electrician, mechanics, tailoring, household support staff, hair dre ssing, beauty salons and parlours \\nand the like have mushroomed all over urban Bangladesh, especially in the high -income metropolitan cities \\nof Dhaka and Chittagong. The high -income elasticity of demand for these services and plentiful supply \\nmakes this a v ery vibrant source of income and employment. Wage data from the 2015 -16 Labour Force \\nSurvey shows that the average wages in non -household informal activities tend to be higher than average   \\n \\n260 \\n wages in manufacturing (BBS 2017).  As in the case of trading, the highly flexible employment market \\nwith almost no regulatory intervention and minimum investment requirement have contributed to the \\nexpansion of this activity.  \\nTable 3.5: The Structure of Service sector  (% GDP)  at Current  Price  \\nActivity  FY1980  FY1990  FY20 00 FY201 0 FY2019  \\nTrade  12.92  12.28  13.30  14.0 13.34  \\nTransport  10.42  9.53 7.49 9.01 8.24 \\nTelecommunication  0.23 0.4 0.68 1.56 1.10 \\nFinancial Services  1.31 1.38 1.75 3.08 3.89 \\nReal Estate  8.70 8.54 9.48 7.15 7.87 \\nPublic Administration  1.40 2.05 2.85 3.34 4.09 \\nEducation  1.98 1.88 2.43 2.40 3.02 \\nHealth  2.33 2.29 2.12 2.01 2.15 \\nHotels and Restaurants  0.57 0.59 0.6 0.92 1.04 \\nPersonal and Community Services  7.95 9.35 12.22  12.57  10.78  \\nTotal Services  47.81  48.28  52.91  56.05  55 \\n   Source: Bangladesh Bure au of Statistics     \\nTable 3.6: Composition of Transport Sector (% of GDP)  \\nTransportation Mode/Activity  FY1980  FY1990  FY2000  FY2010  FY 2019  \\nLand 5.3 6.2 6.4 7.3 7.0 \\nWater  2.5 2 1.1 0.9 0.7 \\nAir 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 \\nStorage etc.  0.2 0.3 0.4 0.6 0.6 \\nTotal  Transport  8.1 8.7 8.1 8.9 8.4 \\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics  \\nThe third major service activity is the transport sector. Following an immediate expansion between \\nFY1974 -FY1980, on average the transport sector has underperformed. The major transpor t components are \\nshown in Table 3.6. Land transport seems to have performed well, growing faster than overall GDP, but \\nwater and air transport have performed poorly. Even in land transport, there are major performance issues \\nin road infrastructure and rail  services.  \\nThe rapid decline in the share of water transport underscores the huge neglect of this mode of transportation.  \\nGiven the large network of waterways in Bangladesh, river transport serves a major development role in \\nterms mobility of rural peopl e and commodity flow.  It can also be a dynamic source of employment and \\npoverty reduction for the rural poor. With the growing congestion of road network and limited capacity of \\nrail cargo services, water transport provides a huge, environmentally friendl y alternative that has been by -\\npassed.  \\nThere are several factors that have constrained the performance of river transport. The most important factor \\nis the limited navigability of many river ways  owing to the growing incidence of siltation. Huge investmen ts \\nare needed for river dredging to make them navigable and conducive to the use of modern river vessels. A   \\n \\n261 \\n second factor is the inadequacy of safety standards to protect people and cargoes from accidents. Many \\nriver vessels have questionable river -worthin ess features. Additionally, the frequency of over -loading is \\nhuge.  Due to absence of adequate monitoring and enforcement, safety standards are frequently violated \\nresulting in accidents that cause substantial loss of life and property. Because of safety c oncerns a large \\namount of potential river traffic tends to get diverted to land transport that further adds to the congestion \\nproblem. A third problem is the inadequacy of river ports and cargo handling capacities. It is obvious that \\na combination of major  investments in river dredging and river ports combined with effective monitoring \\nand implementation of safety standards will substantially improve the quality of water transport and spur \\nprivate investment and value -added. Investments during the 8FYP are  expected to make up for this \\ndeficiency.  \\nRegarding air transport, the main constraint is the weak performance of the national carrier Bangladesh \\nBiman. The demand for air transport has swelled at both the international and domestic level.  Yet, capacity \\nconstraints and management deficiencies have plagued the national carrier.  Consequently, fleet capacity, \\nreliability and service quality remain weak. As a result, it has not been able to benefit much from the large \\ngrowth in the demand for both internationa l and domestic travel. High -performing international carriers \\nhave captured the bulk of the market share of international travel to and from Bangladesh. In the area of \\ndomestic air travel, the government deregulated air operations to allow for national bas ed private air \\nservices. The response has been positive but inadequate. A major constraint is investment.  Air services are \\nhighly capital intensive and also require special skills, the absence of which tends to make domestic private \\ninvestment hesitant to  enter this high -risk sector. The inadequacy of domestic air connectivity combined \\nwith heavily congested land transport is a major constraint to the growth of the tourism industry.   \\nA fourth large contributor to services GDP is the real estate sector. It  has generally been on an upward trend \\nsince FY1974, achieving its fastest growth during the first 10 years after independence.  As a result, its \\nGDP share surged from 4.9 percent in FY1974 to 10.2 percent in FY1980. The activities of the real estate \\nsecto r got a boost from the inflow of remittances.  Also, with growing urbanization, the demand for urban \\nhousing and urban office space has surged. The supply of real estate services has responded adequately to \\nthe demand and the market works competitively. Ho wever, speculative activities over the 2007 -10 periods \\ncaused an over -investment in high -cost urban housing projects that have created a market bubble.  Real \\nestate prices and urban housing rents have moderated in response to this bubble, causing a slowdow n in the \\ngrowth of real estate activities. Its share in GDP is down to 6.1% in FY2019.  \\nAdditionally, there are major policy constraints that prevent the emergence of a modern and efficient real \\nestate market. First concerns the inadequacy of home loan mor tgage services and the second is the \\ninadequacy of enforcement of zoning regulations.  The inadequacy of long -term home mortgage options \\nreduces the effective demand for housing services, while the ineffectiveness of zoning regulations reduces \\nthe quality of real estate services with excessive bias towards commercial real estate services. This in turn \\ncontributes to the weakness of urban development.  \\nThe low GDP contribution of education and health and nutrition services despite growth of these services \\nmay reflect the expansion of low -quality these services. While the composition of activities in both sectors \\nhas changed substantially with a growing share of private provision, the average service quality and inputs \\nremain low. The inadequacy of tertiary edu cation in science and technology area is emerging as a major \\nconstraint to the expansion of quality manufacturing and high -value -added service exports. In the area of   \\n \\n262 \\n health  and nutrition , the absence of modern health financing options, such as health insu rance, is an \\nimportant constraint to the more rapid expansion of higher value health and nutrition services.  \\nOne major service industry not directly reflected in the service sector value -added is the role of tourism.  \\nWhile the international travel -related  effects of tourism are captured through the travel receipts in the \\nservice account of the balance of payments, other aspects of tourism linked hospitality services and \\ndomestic transport are captured in transport, hotels and restaurants. Additionally, the re are large indirect \\neffects linked to tourist spending on travel, hotels, food, and purchases of other local goods and services. \\nResearch shows that the multiplier effects of tourism can be large as reflected in the role of tourism in such \\neconomies as T hailand and Malaysia.  \\n3.6.2  The Quest for Modernization of Service S ector  Activities  \\nReviewing the structure and evolution of Bangladesh’s service sector , one would get the impression that \\nthe economy has already reached the appropriate relative size of s ervices to GDP as one would expect in a \\nMIC – slightly over 50% contribution to GDP (see Fig.3.1b). But that is not the case. Though the \\ncontribution to GDP of services is 51%, as already mentioned, much of the services activities are \\ncharacterized by info rmal CMS Es operations without the kind of wage employment one would find in \\nindustry or formal services, like banking and finance, education, and public administration. According to \\nLFS 2016 -17, some 71.8% of the workforce engaged in services are employed in informal activities. Thus,  \\nthe goal of structural transformation in services during the 8FYP  period would be the expansion and \\nmodernization of service activities so that the service sector  plays its role as a productive and dynamic \\nsegment of a rapidly  developing economy. Needless to say, a modern and efficient service sector can play \\neffective intermediary to boost output and productivity in industry and agriculture.  \\nBut we face an enormous challenge in order to transform this sector into a predominant ly modern operation \\nwith formal institutions and enterprises. Modernization has been creeping in. There are parts of services \\nthat have leapfrogged into the modern digital era by adopting the latest advances in technology (e.g. \\nwidespread use of ICT and on line services, mobile telephone , digital financial services, etc.). The march of \\ntechnological innovation is so rapid that it is fast changing the way we live and do business, even in \\nBangladesh which is not yet recognized for its depth of ICT usage.  \\nYet, there is still a long way to go on the path of modernization of  the service sector . In addition to the \\ntraditional definition of formal service sector  that mostly includes public administration, public health and \\npublic education, in each category of serv ice there is a mix of formal and informal provision. The absence \\nof data makes it difficult to fully understand the extent of modernization of the service sector . In view of \\nthis limitation, the modernization is defined more specifically to include the for mal public sector and the \\ngrowth of a range of private sector services that are well organized and registered with the government, that \\nis much more skill based, that involves better technology and that are relatively more capital intensive. \\nThese activiti es include Telecoms and ICT, banking and financial services, aviation industry, international \\nshipping, hospitality industry (hotel and restaurants) and modern storage and transport support services. \\nEach of these activities holds considerable growth prosp ects and can cater to both domestic and \\ninternational demand.    \\n \\n263 \\n The expansion of high potential modern service activities is indicated in Figure 3.10. Starting from low \\nbase values in FY1990, all services, except healthcare and air transport, have grown fas ter than GDP. The \\nfinancial sector in particular has done well, thereby acquiring a rapid increase in its GDP share. Storage and \\ntransport support services and telecoms/I CT services have also performed well. However, in comparison to \\nits potential I CT and telecoms services have under -performed. International shipping also has under -\\nperformed. Hospitality service growth has shown some momentum starting from its tiny base value, but \\ncompared to potential it has under -performed. Along with domestic air travel,  it constitutes another \\nconstraint to the expansion of tourism activities. The healthcare services require special policy attention. In \\nhigh income countries healthcare tends to be one of the most dynamic and high value -added activity.  \\nThe growth of high -potential services is beginning to make an impact in terms of modernization of the \\nservice sector .  Thus, the share of modern services has more than tripled from 18 percent in FY1990 to 59 \\npercent in FY2019 (Figure 3.11). Much of the growth has come from pr ivate -sector led modern services \\ninvolving finance and technology. Nevertheless, as noted, most of these services are under -performing \\nrelative to domestic and international demand. In particular ITC, hospitality services, shipping and aviation \\nservices ca n considerably expand by taking advantage of considerable global demand for these services. \\nAdditionally, housing, healthcare and education will need to create the basis for supporting the skills base \\nand the technology base to spur the development of the manufacturing sector.   \\nFigure 3.10: Evolution of Modern Services (% of GDP)  \\n \\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\n \\n \\n \\n 8.113.31.09.33.97.94.13.02.210.8\\n5.811.90.69.71.38.32.01.82.29.1\\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16ConstructionWholesale and Retail TradeHotels and RestaurantsTransport, Storage and CommunicationFinancial IntermediariesReal Estate, Renting and Business ActivitiesPublic Administration and DefenceEducationHealth and Social WorkCommunity, Social and Personal Services\\n1990 2019  \\n \\n264 \\n Figure 3.11: Structural Change in Services  \\n \\nSource: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\nCommensurate with its growing import ance in the economy, the employment share of modern services has \\nalso increased significantly over the years. The growth has been particularly dramatic since 2010. This is \\nan important indication of the slowly improving formal employment base in the servic e sector . Yet, this \\nperformance has to gather momentum if Bangladesh were to achieve services modernization characteristic \\nof a MIC by 2031, and a highly modern sector with predominantly formal enterprises and institutions as \\nthe country reached HIC status  by 2041  \\n3.6.3  The Productivity Challenge in Services  \\nApart from the specific need to expand the contribution of high -potential services in the economy, there is \\nthe more general challenge of increasing the productivity of services activities. Professional  and skill -\\nintensive services such as banking, finance, ICT, healthcare, education, shipping and aviation tend to be \\nhigh productivity, high income activities.  As noted above, the role of these activities is still limited despite \\nrecent growth.  Other ser vices like trade, transport and personal services have done well but generally they \\ntend to be dominated by low productivity, low skills and unorganized activities.  \\nIn order to provide a reference point, it is first important to look at how average labour  productivity \\neconomy wide in Bangladesh compares internationally across key trading competitors.  This is shown in \\nFigure 3.12.  To make comparisons meaningful, GDP is measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.  \\nThe good news is that Bangladesh has made important progress in improving average labour productivity \\nbetween 1991 and 2016.  The bad news is that there is still a lot of catching up to do to approach the \\nproductivity levels of competitors.  Average labour productivity in Bangladesh is 53 per cent lower than in \\nIndia; 69 percent lower than in China; 75 percent lower than in Sri Lanka and 86 percent lower than in \\nMalaysia. Increasing average labour productivity is perhaps the biggest challenge facing Bangladesh in \\naspiring to reach higher income  in the next 20 years.  \\nLooking at the Bangladesh sectoral productivity, the average labour productivity in manufacturing is the \\nhighest, followed by services (Figure 3.13).  Not surprisingly, average productivity is the lowest in \\nagriculture, which pulls down the average productivity nationwide and partly explains the observed very \\nlow average labour productivity at the international comparator level.  The average productivity 1859\\n010203040506070\\n1990 2019% of Modern Services  \\n \\n265 \\n differentials across sectors are reasonable.  The development process involves l abour transfers from the \\nlowest productivity activity (agriculture) to medium average productivity activity (services) and then \\neventually to the highest productivity activity (industry).  \\nFigure 3.12: Average Labour Productivity in Bangladesh and  \\nComparat or Countries (2011 PPP$)  \\n \\n  Source: The World Bank  \\nFigure 3.13: Trend in Average Labour Productivity, 1995/96 Prices  \\n      \\n  Source: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  17,48812,99432,44432,88214,55658,40119,15727,87710,884\\n5,1643,12513,06510,66311,53929,4284,8312,9913,042\\n0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000South AsiaVietnamThailandSri LankaPakistanMalaysiaIndiaChinaBangladesh\\n1991 2018\\n050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000\\nFY1981 FY1991 FY2000 FY2010 FY2017Taka\\nAgriculture Industry Service Overall  \\n \\n266 \\n The productivity challenge in the service sector  is clear. According to LFS 2015 -16, trade and transport \\naccount for 57% of total services employment. An additional 5% are employed as household staff.  \\nCombining these low productivity workers with the low productivity outcome of education s ervices (10% \\nof the work force);  some 72% of service sector  employment suffers from low average productivity. \\nModernizing and upgrading the quality of this 72% of the service sector employment is a major challenge \\nthat the 8FYP  will need to address.  \\n3.6.4  The Skills Challenge in Services  \\nInformal employ ment permeates the largest segment of service sector s – wholesale and retail trade, \\ntransport and personal services .  Low wages and low productivity are pervasive in this segment, compared \\nwith the high productivity in professional services (ICT, Telecoms,  finance, etc .  This is largely explained \\nby the skills differentials between these activities. On average, the professional services are characterized \\nby labour force with tertiary degrees and other professional and specialized training.  In contrast, the  average \\neducation level in transport, trade and personal services is very low. Figure 3.14 shows the education \\nattainments of employed labour in Bangladesh. The Figure 3.15 shows that some good progress has been \\nachieved in improving the education profile  of the work force but the gaps remain alarming. Some 32 per \\ncent of the Bangladesh labour force had zero education even as late as FY2016. This number is as high as \\n45 per cent  in agriculture. About 26 per cent  have only primary education, while 31 per ce nt have secondary \\neducation.  Only 11 per cent  have tertiary level education (higher secondary and above).  On average the \\neducation attainments of the service sector are better than industry and agriculture. For example, on average, \\nsome 22 per cent  of se rvices workers have tertiary level education as compared with 9 per cent  in industry \\nand only 3 per cent  in agriculture.  \\nFigure 3.14: Education Profile of the Workforce  \\n \\nSource: Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2016 -17, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)   45\\n242332\\n2632\\n2326 263533\\n31\\n2510\\n6\\n0.7410.7\\n5.3\\n0.1 0.2 0.5 0.2\\n05101520253035404550\\nAgriculture Industry Service Total\\nNone Primary Secondary Higher Secondary Tertiary Others  \\n \\n267 \\n Figure 3.15: Improving Education Profile of the Workforce  \\n \\n  Source: LFS, 2010; LFS 2015 -16.  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics  \\nSome further insights on the skills challenge in the service sector  can be obtained from the combined \\nanalysis of the 2010 Labour F orce Survey data and the 2010 HIES data. The LFS 2010 suggests that some \\n79 per cent  of labour force engaged in service sector  is informal in nature. The level of formality varies \\nconsiderably by occupation, with most informal activities concentrated in tr ade, transport and personal \\nservices (over 90 per cent  of activities are informal in nature) while activities in financial sector, education, \\nreal estate and public administration are mostly formal (60 -80 per cent ).  According to HIES 2010, the \\naverage yea rs of schooling for formal workers are 10.1 years among public sector employees and 5.9 years \\namong private sector employees. In  contrast, informal workers including day labourers and self -employed  \\nhave 2.1 and 4.2 years of education , on average, respectiv ely. In 2010 there were some 15 million -day \\nlabourers and 20 million self -employed in the workforce. Some 9.7 million -day labourers and 8.9 million \\nself-employed had no education at all. A World Bank Survey of reading assessment of rural non -farm \\nworkers c onducted in 2009 showed that some 77 per cent  of non -farm day workers and 57 per cent  of no -\\nfarm self -employed could not read.  The bulk  of these informal workers and self -employed are engaged in \\nthe service sector . These data are indicative of the skills challenge of the service sector as well as the broader \\nskills challenge for the workforce in general.  \\nNot surprisingly, the skills situation in the formal services is better. Modern services such as ICT, telecoms, \\nfinancial sector, aviation, international  shipping and professional services are the largest employer of the \\ngraduates of the tertiary education system.  Although there are quality differentials among supply sources \\nof the tertiary education network, the expansion of these services is usually con strained by supply of \\nspecialized skills needed. In particular, the ICT industry is constrained by supply of requisite skills. Public \\nadministration, education and health services are primarily dominated by the graduates of the tertiary \\neducation system, y et quality differential between various suppliers of tertiary education is substantial that \\nreduces the value -added of these services.   Though the modern segment of services is constrained by \\n05101520253035404550\\nagriculture Industry Services Total Agriculture Industry Services Total\\n2010 2016\\nNo education\\n Primary education  \\n \\n268 \\n inadequate supply of workforce specialized in requisite skills, in the evolving knowledge economy the skills \\nsituation is significantly better than what we find in informal services.  \\nIn 2015 -16 about 11.5 per cent  of the workforce (6.9 million workers) acquired skills from the higher \\neducation system and most of them a re employed in formal service sector .  Male graduates outnumber \\nfemale graduates.  Enrolment in higher education is expanding rapidly in recent years.  BANEBIS (2015) \\ndata show that college enrolment (HSC and above) grew at a rapid pace of 11.6 per cent  between 2005 and \\n2015. Female enrolment has grown slightly faster than men (13 per cent  and 10.5 per cent  respectively). \\nThis is the result of both a higher rate of graduation at the secondary level and also the rapid growth of \\nprivate supply of tertiary edu cation. This is a welcome development and with continued progress this will \\nbe highly beneficial for the expansion of modern services including ICT.  Nevertheless, there are substantial \\nquality issues.  Additionally, less than 10 per cent  of the students a re enrolled in engineering, science and \\ntechnology related subjects. This low concentration technical and scientific education is a serious weakness \\nof the higher education system and tends to reduce the relevance of the higher education to market demand.  \\n3.6.5  The Challenge of Non -Factor Services Exports  \\nThe strong performance of international remittances (export of factor services) is indicative of the success \\nachieved by Bangladesh in the employment of migrant exporting  workers abroad (export of factor services \\nunder Mode 4 of GATS), especially to the Middle East countries. This is a welcome development and \\nbenefitted from a range of government support services including remittance facilitation, government level \\ndialogue with host countries to protect th e interests of the migrant workers, tax exemption and cash \\nincentives, and information sharing.  There is a dedicated Ministry, The Ministry of Expatriate’s Welfare \\nand Overseas Employment, that is dedicated to the promotion of legal overseas employment, p romoting \\nmigrant well -being, and protecting promotes  the interests of the migrant workers abroad and at home. \\nFurther efforts are underway to improve these services. As compared to this, the success in expanding the \\nexports of other NFS is more limited.  \\nThe breakdown of services NFS export income is shown in Table 3.7.  The largest source of service NFS \\nexport (non -factor services -NFS) income is government services (47 per cent ), arising from immigration \\nrelated service provided by the Home and Foreign Mi nistries (including Bangladesh Embassies) and \\nfinancial services of Bangladesh Bank.  In the private sector, the four largest service exports in FY2019 are \\ntransport (15 per cent ), Telecoms and ICT (14 per cent ), business services (13%) and tourism (5%).  The \\nremaining 6% is comprised of a range of services including financial services.  While the composition of \\nprivate export earnings from services looks promising, the yields from three high -potential activities: \\ninternational transport, tourism and ICT ar e very much below potential.   \\nInternational Transport Services:  In transport, the opportunity cost of weak earnings is reflected in service \\npayments. As compared with export earnings of merely $663427 million fr om transport services in FY2019 , \\nBangladesh paid a huge service charge on transport from international providers to the tune of $  44756.9 \\nmillion. This yawning deficit on the transport front is a reflection of the strong dependence on foreign \\nshipping and airlines for international passengers and fr eight services owing to the weak capacities and \\npoor service quality of Bangladesh air and shipping services.  The fact that Bangladesh’s merchandise trade \\ngrew from $13 billion in FY2000 to about $100 billion in FY2019 presents a huge opportunity for \\nsubstantial expansion of national shipping and air transport services that remains unexploited. The huge   \\n \\n269 \\n demand for these services from trading and passenger traffic presents a substantial investment opportunity \\nfor local investors that needs to be cashed in t hrough proper public investments in related assets and \\ninfrastructure (sea ports and airports, operation of private and public shipping and airlines, and container \\nterminals) and with facilitating regulatory policies. This effort will also create good jobs  for the labour \\nforce. There is enormous scope for job creation in these service sector activities.   \\nTable 3.7: Non -Factor Services Exports Income ($ Million)  \\nType of Services \\n(NFS)  FY2010  FY2011  FY2012  FY2013  FY2014  FY2017  FY2018  FY2019  \\nTotal NFS Income  2233.6  2570.2  2491.4  2827.6  3115.3  3642.2  4260.11  6221.90  \\n1.

Although a part of the tourism is reflected in the \\ntravel receipts in the service account of the balance of payments, the employment and GDP effects based \\non tourist spending on trav el, hotels, food and purchases of other local goods and services are picked up in \\nthe growth of value -added and employment in transport, hotels, restaurants and trade activities. While all \\nactivities have forward and backward linkages, tourism is particula rly potent source of forward and \\nbackward linkages unleashing a lot of derived demand activities. Consequently, tourism can be a major \\nsource of growth and employment in a developing economy.  \\nBangladesh is blessed with natural beauty, ranging from mountai ns to rivers to beaches to bio -diversity. It \\nboasts the longest natural beach in the world in Cox’s Bazaar as well as the largest mangrove forest in the \\nworld at the Sundarbans. Despite this, the tourism industry is far from thriving. According to World Tr avel \\n& Tourism Council (WTTC), in FY2019, tourism in Bangladesh accounted for an estimated 3 per cent  of \\nthe total economy, around US$ 9.11 billion. Travel and tourism contributed 1.86 million jobs, which was \\n2.9% of total employment – while the internatio nal visitors had an impact of US$ 333 million, 0.7% of total \\nexports.  \\nTable 3.8 provides an international comparison of the performance of Bangladesh tourism sector prepared \\nby WTTC.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism is vested with the overall coordinating \\nresponsibilities for policy formulation while implementation is the responsibility of the Bangladesh Parjatan \\nCorporation.

The emphasis gained \\nmomentum in the wake of the leadership role provided by Prime Mini ster Sheikh Hasina through the Digital \\nBangladesh initiative developed in the context of Vision 2021. Chapter 12  lays out the medium - and long -\\nterm vision for harnessing the digital technological revolution for acceleration of inclusive growth.  Both \\nthe 6th Five Year Plan and the 7FYP put considerable emphasis to the implementation of the Digital \\nBangladesh Initiative. Considerable progress has been achieved. However, much of the ICT focus has been \\nin improving the connectivity and service delivery inland w ithin the country.  The impact on export of ICT \\nservices has been relatively modest when compared with the global market prospect.  Earnings from ICT \\nexports have grown from US$ 247 million in FY 2010 to US$ 549 million in FY2019. This is a welcome \\nincreas e but pales into insignificance when compared with ICT earnings of US$ 137 billion in India in \\nFY2019 (Statista 2020). Even after allowing for size effects, India’s exports of ICT services amount to 4.66 \\nper cent  of its GDP whereas it is less than 0.2 per cent of the GDP in Bangladesh. The global market for \\nICT services is large and India has successfully tapped this market even while expanding ICT services \\ndomestically. An important target for the services exports for the Eighth Plan will be to boost the p enetration \\nof Bangladesh into the global ICT market through a well thought out ICT strategy that looks at both \\ndomestic market and also the global market. This progress will then lay the basis for longer -term growth of \\nICT exports.  \\nThe past experience sugg ests a number of factors that constrain the growth of ICT exports.  First, although \\na significant number of educated and qualified entrepreneurs have started ICT ventures during the last \\ncouple of decades, most are trapped in the ‘small size -low growth’ si tuation because of funding constraints. \\nSecond, there are severe gaps in both quantity and quality of human resources for the software industry. \\nThis is due to institutional deficiency of the tertiary ICT -related educational institutions (lack of industry \\norientation of teaching resources, slowness of curriculum modernization etc.) as well as inadequate quality \\ninput from the higher secondary education system to the tertiary level.  Third, high cost of bandwidth deters \\ngrowth of domestic market for ICT. Fou rth, the absence of IT park/software Technology Park, high internet \\ncost, no redundant submarine cable, and power shortages are some of the common infrastructural problems \\nfor most of the IT enterprises. The weakness in ICT infrastructure capabilities is w ell reflected by the World \\nEconomic Forum’s (WEF) Networked Readiness Index (NRI) performance that measures the capacity of \\nthe countries to leverage ICT for development (Figure 3.16) (WEF 2019).  Finally, the growth of export of \\nICT industry is below the expected level due to inadequacy in entrepreneurial dynamism, limited overseas \\nmarketing budget and absence of government level initiatives in promoting  country brand. Policies and \\nfacilities are not friendly for value added service providers in the mobile  phone industry.     \\n \\n272 \\n Figure 3.16: Network Readiness Index (NRI) Rankings, 2019  \\n(Out of 121 Countries)  \\n \\nSource: Network Readiness Index (NRI), Portolans  Institute  \\nNevertheless, things are happening fast. Acknowledging these constraints and recognizing the hu ge export \\npotential of this industry, the Government in concert with the Bangladesh Computer Council is proactively \\nengaged in resolving the problem issues on a priority basis, activities that will be intensified during the \\n8FYP . Bangladesh Computer Counci l has played a vital role to promote ICT industry both locally and \\nglobally. Leveraging ICT project has promoted local IT and ITES capabilities into global market leading \\nto improved global awareness and perception of Bangladesh for IT and ITES business. B angladesh Hi -Tech \\nPark Authority (BHTPA) is nursing and promoting IT Start-ups/IT Entrepreneurs to establish giant IT \\nCompany like Google /Apple / Microsoft/Amazon / Alibaba. In this regard, BHTPA has allotted space, \\ninternet and electricity free of cost to  100+ selected local IT Start -ups/IT Entrepreneurs; some of them are \\ntransformed into registered BPO/KPO/IT Company. Furthermore, BHTPA is promoting local BPO/KPO/IT \\nCompanies for getting international standards like CMMIL -5, CMMIL -3, ISO - 9001 and ISO - 27001 etc. \\nAlready 2 companies -CMMIL -5, 21 companies -CMMIL -3, 47 companies ISO - 9001, 6 companies - ISO- \\n27001 have received international standard certification by the patronization of BHTPA.  \\n3.6.6  Institutional Support and Facilitating Regulations  \\nThe service sector  is dominated by private business es and individuals. Public ownership of services is \\nlimited primarily to public administration, public schooling, public health facilities , a limited number of \\npublic financial enterprises  and dedicated infrastruc ture (e.g. High -Tech Parks) . So, the main driver of \\nservice output, export and employment is private enterprise and private investment.  Yet, the government’s \\nrole is very important in providing the infrastructure support services, in providing a flexible regulatory  \\nregime and facilitating institutional support.   Over the years, through a series of deregulation drives and \\nassociated policies, the service sector was progressively deregulated and private provision encouraged. This \\nderegulation policy has con tinued with recent efforts focused on encouraging private provision even in \\nareas that are traditionally considered the domain of the public sector: education, ICT services, aviation and \\nelectricity.  The response to this deregulation drive has been highly  positive.   101837963564132\\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120BangladeshSri LankaIndiaVietnamThailandChinaMalaysia  \\n \\n273 \\n Despite good progress, there are several areas of regulatory concern that will need to be addressed moving \\nforward. The first relates to regulatory policies for the ICT sector. The price of bandwidth needs to be \\nreduced to facilitate increasin g number of net users, enhancing demand for local content and applications \\nand developing a connected Bangladesh. Whilst the lowest recorded price of fixed -broadband (as a per cent  \\nof GNI per capita) is 0.7 per cent in case of China, it is 7.3 per cent in Bangladesh. The Rural \\nTelecommunications Network Development and Utilization Guideline 2010 will need to be implemented \\nto make sure that the existing network infrastructures have been optimally utilized for commercial \\ncommunication and key social services  (e.g. education, health care, e -governance, etc.).   \\nA second important  issue is the taxation policy. The tax rates on ICT services and banking services are very \\nhigh and may need to be revisited, especially to spur the expansion of ICT. For example, tota l taxes on ICT \\nsector are a whopping 58 per cent , which is among the highest in the world.  This policy is also inconsistent \\nwith the Prime Minister’s Digital Bangladesh Policy  and would have to be revisited .  \\nA third set  of regulatory issues that needs at tention concerns quality assurance and accountability.  Both \\nthese matters relate specifically to education, health and hospitality services.  A huge number of \\neducational, health and hospitality enterprises have mushroomed throughout the country, but qual ity of \\nservice provided, safety standards of food catered to customers, cleanliness and hygienic environment and \\naccountability of medical profession for improper diagnosis and medications have not received adequate \\nattention. For example, the low value -added of education services is partly a reflection of low quality and \\ninadequate regulatory standards.  \\nA fourth regulatory  issue concerns transport safety standards in both land and river transport.  The frequency \\nof fatal accidents for both modes of transpo rt is far too many and cannot be considered as acceptable.  As \\nnoted earlier, in addition to the issue of navigability of many river routes owing to heavy siltation, the \\ninadequacy of safety standards of river transport has substantially lowered the demand  for this important \\nmode of transport.  \\nA fifth regulatory issue concerns compliance with zoning laws.  In the absence of proper implementation \\nof zoning laws, the location of service enterprises has complicated urban traffic management and reduced \\nthe qua lity of life and safety standards of residential neighbourhoods.  This matter needs urgent attention \\nand resolution through a time -bound implementation.  \\nRegulations are helpful only to the extent that these are properly monitored and implemented.  The \\naccountability for regulations and implementations is usually assigned to concerned line Ministries \\noverseeing the service along with a number of specialized institutions. The rapid growth in private services \\nhas not been matched by an expansion in the capacit ies of these ministries and agencies. Moreover, there \\nare substantive challenges regarding training and incentive policies for public agency staff that are linked \\nmore broadly to overall public administration capacity and good governance. This is a long -term challenge \\nthat will need to be addressed holistic ally over a long period of time , with sustained progress during the \\n8FYP.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n274 \\n 3.7 8FYP STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING THE ROLE OF THE SERVICE SECTOR    \\n3.7.1  Service sector  Strategy  \\nThe growing importance of the servic e sector  for growth and job creation suggests that continued strong \\nperformance of the service -economy will be critical to achieve the PP2041 target of reaching UMIC by \\nFY2931 and attaining HIC by FY20141.  The strategy for the service sector  under the 8FYP is to consolidate \\npast gains, build on the lessons of past experiences in Bangladesh and in other countries and focus on \\naddressing the specific issues and concerns highlighted in the preceding Section. The sector strategy \\nconsists of  the following major  elements:  \\n1) Improve the incentive policies for boosting private investment in services.  \\n2) Increase public investment in key service sector infrastructure.  \\n3) Develop capabilities that strengthen the skills base for the service industry and the industrial \\nsector.  \\n4) Develop effective programmes  for the productive use of remittance inflows and improve facilities \\nfor migrant workers to legally exploit job opportunities abroad and send remittances home.  \\n5) Strengthen implementation of prudential regulations to boost servi ce quality, increase public \\nsafety, improve compliance and ensure accountability of service providers.  \\n6) Strengthen public institutions to support the growth of service sector  and improve service quality, \\nsafety and accountability.  \\n7) Develop a modern public ad ministration that is consistent with the needs of an Upper Middle -\\nIncome  Country (UMIC).  \\n8) Support skills development for employment and entrepreneurship  \\n3.7.2  Incentive Policies  \\nLearning from the positive results of the past experience in Bangladesh, the de regulation drive to motivate \\ngreater private provision of service sector  activities should be strengthened. Experience with deregulation \\nof the service industry in other emerging economies, especially India, is similarly positive. Each line \\nMinistry concer ned with regulating a particular service should undertake dialogue with concerned service \\nproviders through public meetings with business chambers and conduct special purpose surveys as \\nnecessary to obtain specific feedback on regulatory burden or other co nstraints. The findings of these \\nconsultations and surveys will be  used to reform policies and institutions as relevant. Foreign investment \\nin export -oriented services will be  promoted, especially with a view to importing technology and thereby \\nincreasing service quality and export competitiveness.  Import of technical skills in the area of aviation, \\ninternational shipping, ICT and tourism should be facilitated. Wherever possible, joint venture with foreign \\npartners will be encouraged. To encourage greater tourism, the visa requirements for visitors will be further \\nsimplified through visa on arrival facilities.  Steps will also be taken to ensure the full safety and courteous \\ntreatment of all visitors.  \\nICT facilitation:  The Government recognizes that the ICT  is a high potential sector. The Digital Bangladesh \\nInitiative reflects this priority. While considerable progress has been made, the ICT industry is still at an \\nearly formative stage and there is tremendous scope for service expansion and industry growth.  In that \\nregard, the Government will  review all ICT policies to ensure their consistency with private incentives for   \\n \\n275 \\n additional investment. Specifically, the Government will invite private sector and not -for-profit sector for \\nrolling out broadband connecti vity in rural area. The Government is aware that the tax policy for ICT has \\nbeen raised as a major issue by the service providers. It is important to tackle this swiftly in order to facilitate \\nadditional investments from private providers and boost demand.  The tax policy for ICT will be re -\\nexamined comprehensively to check for its consistency with the development objective of faster growth of \\nthis high return enterprise. The relevant international experience will be reviewed to determine proper \\nresponse to this incentive issue. The competitiveness of the ICT industry is necessary to attract additional \\nforeign investment and expand ICT services exports. The Government also endorses ICT as a major tool \\nfor COVID 19 response in Bangladesh. The Government mandat es the ICT Division to undertake necessary \\nactions to support other ministries to integrate ICT for COVID 19 response, impact mitigation and growth.  \\nInternational shipping:  The considerable gap between payments for shipping services and income received \\nshould be addressed quickly. Bangladesh now has gained considerable shipping experiences. The merchant \\nnavy has developed considerable capacity based on the graduates of the Chittagong Marine Academy \\n(CMA).  The CMA trainees have international recognition and  many graduates proceed for international \\ntraining.  As a result, there is a large body of trained marine staff many of whom work for international \\nshipping firms. With adequate investments the Bangladesh shipping companies can fruitfully use this skill \\nbase to serve the shipping needs of the country’s growing merchandise foreign trade. Total merchandise \\ntrade amounted to $73 billion in FY2017.  The usual shipping margin is about 10%, which yields a total \\nshipping market of about $7.3 billion. If Bangladesh  can tap even 50% of this market, earnings from \\nshipping will grow from $0.4 billion now to $3.6 billion. The high potential of the shipping sector is \\nobvious. To facilitate the growth of private shipping the government should immediately organize a \\nconsul tation session with local and international private shipping companies to find out major obstacles and \\nconstraints to improve the shipping industry including regulatory barriers and taxation issue. Based on this, \\nnecessary reforms should be initiated to st rengthen the national shipping sector.   \\nInternational and domestic aviation: In the area of aviation, the Government will explore the option of \\ntwining arrangements between Bangladesh Biman and a reputed international airline. A similar \\narrangement betwee n Emirates and Ari Lanka was very helpful in upgrading the capability of Air Lanka. \\nThe partnership with a reputed foreign carrier will provide Biman management essential on -the-job training \\nwith how to run and manage a profitable airline industry in this globalized and highly competitive aviation \\nworld. The demand for air services, especially to London and the Middle East market, is huge and the \\nupgrading of Biman skills and service performance will allow the capture of a larger share of this market. \\nWith good and reliable services, Biman can also attract cost -conscious international travellers  visiting \\nBangladesh. Biman should be run as a commercial enterprise with full management flexibility.  \\nManagement and staff remuneration should be market based and m anagement should be held accountable \\nfor financial performance.  \\nRegarding domestic aviation, the possibility of joint ventures with international partners will be encouraged. \\nThe shortage of domestic private investment is a major constraint to the expansio n of domestic air services, \\nwhich in turn hurts tourism prospects. Joint ventures with international partners might help relieve this \\nconstraint. The possibility of joint ventures in international shipping should also be explored. For both \\nareas, a special  study should be commissioned to highlight the constraints and identify specific reforms.  \\nThe study should be conducted in the next year or so and its recommendations should be implemented \\nfollowing cabinet approval.    \\n \\n276 \\n Safe and secure aviation system:  The 7 FYP adopted a significant program me to upgrade both the \\ninternational and domestic aviation capacities.  The 8FYP will build on this progress and strengthen \\nimplementation. Based on this experience , a longer -term aviation plan to meet the air travel needs o f a high -\\nincome country will be developed with technical assistance of international aviation experts. Lessons of \\nexperience of highly successful and profitable Asian and Middle Eastern aviation giants like Singapore \\nAirlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Etiha d and Qatar airways will be analysed  to gain insights regarding the \\ndevelopment of the long -term aviation plan of Bangladesh.   \\nTourism:  In tourism, the strategy consists of two broad elements: Expansion of fixed infrastructure to \\nfacilitate an expanded an d safe aviation system in Bangladesh and second to expand and upgrade the \\ntourism industry facilities comprising of visa and currency exchange facilities, hotels, restaurants, tourist \\nresorts and inland transportation.  \\nTourism facilities and support servi ces: Based on the lessons of good practice international experience \\nfrom countries that have done well in tourism including India, Malaysia and Thailand, the strategy will \\nfocus on 5 entry points: (1) establishing at least 3 premium shopping outlets that m eets international \\nstandards in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet; (2) developing an eco -nature integrated resorts near \\nSundarbans; (3) development of a strait Riviera linking Teknaf to Sundarbans; (4) promoting the \\narchaeological sites; and (5) e stablishing eco parks in Chittagong and Sylhet.  Additionally, there are several \\ncommon enablers that can be put in place to ensure successful implementation of the above. These are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase and focused marketing : Devise and e nsure the right level of mark eting support in the priority \\nmarkets.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure an adequate supply of qualified human capital:  Introduce measures to address issues \\npertaining to the supply and quality of workforce in the tourism industry.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve the tourism environment:  Improve offerings and accessibility for key tourism enablers (such \\nas taxi services, restaurants, hotels and resorts), access to funding, security and regulations as well as \\nimproving the service quality of front -line staff.  \\n\\uf0b7 Rollout of visa facilitation services:  Ensure th at tourists from target markets have easy visa \\nprocedures including online 48to 72 -hour approvals and visa on arrival facilities.  \\n \\nSuccessful implementation of the tourism strategy will require a strong public -private partnership. The \\ngovernment’s role is to provide investments in fixed infrastructure (aviation), provide right incentives and \\nenabling environment including ease of entry and exit, and ensu re the safety of the tourists.  Much of the \\ninvestment in tourism facilities and services will have to com e from the private sector. The Parjatan \\nCorporation will work closely with Chambers of Commerce to determine how this investment promotional \\nactivity can be facilitated. Depending upon need, other incentives including credit facilities and tax \\nincentives m ay be considered as relevant.  Partnership with foreign investors should be encouraged.   \\nHousing: In a typical high -income country, domestic housing is a major source of GDP growth and \\nemployment. Bangladesh is way behind. The issues and challenges are we ll known. The Government needs \\nto develop a thoughtful strategy for boosting the housing sector. The main elements of the strategy are to \\ndevelop a strong enabling environment to facilitate both housing demand and supply.  \\n   \\n \\n277 \\n Demand for housing: The biggest constraint to a large -scale organized housing market (which is typical \\nof all high -income countries) is the absence of a highly - competitive well -organized mortgage financing \\nindustry.  In high -income economies mortgage interest rates are very low as house  ownership tends to be \\nthe safest asset. Long -term low -cost ho using finance up to 40 years is  available from a range of housing \\nfinance companies including commercial banks. The competitive range of mortgage products availability \\ntypically enables young fa milies to afford home ownership at low levels of income with little or even zero \\ndown -payments based on current income and credit history.  Bangladesh has recently made progress with \\nthe emergence of a number of private home mortg age enterprises. But the i nterest cost tends to be high and \\nqualification requirements stringent. Fiscal policies play an important role in home ownership through tax \\ndeduction of interest costs on mortgage and lower tax rates on capital gains of residential property. This is \\nanoth er policy that might be considered by the Government to promote home ownership.  \\nSupply of housing :  On the supply side the biggest constraint is the price of urban land. A host of factors \\nhas contributed to this including poor land administration and high cost of land transactions. Better land \\nmanagement including digitized property records and low -cost land sales and registration procedures are \\nessential reforms to boost housing supply. The regulatory regime also needs to be simplified and properly \\nenforce d in regards to zoning restrictions, building permits and safety standards. Trade tax reduction on \\nhousing materials will also help to lower the cost of housing.  \\n3.7.3  Increase Public Investment in Related Infrastructure  \\nDetails of various service -sector r elated investment program priorities are provided in relevant sectoral \\nchapters.  Some of the highlights are given below.   \\nTransport   \\n\\uf0b7 Convert all inter -district roads to 4 -way lanes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Complete the road/bridge links to make the Asian Highway functional.  \\n\\uf0b7 Com plete the Padma Bridge.  \\n\\uf0b7 Complete all on-going  flyovers in major urban centres, especially Dhaka and Chittagong.  \\n\\uf0b7 Complete the Dhaka circular road.  \\n\\uf0b7 Implement all urban mass transit  projects as scheduled  \\n\\uf0b7 Complete the Karnaphuli tunnel.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expand the railway cap acity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Build the Matarbari dedicated port.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade the effectiveness and capacity of the Mongla Port.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade the Cox’s Bazar Airport.  \\n\\uf0b7 Initiate work on the new international airport.  \\n\\uf0b7 Initiate dredging of majo r river routes  with provisions of maint enance dredging . \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade river docking and storage capacities in major cities.  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n278 \\n Education  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance the quality of education in both primary and secondary education thorough upgrading of \\nboth physical facilities and  teaching materials.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expand the reach of tertiary education with a special focus on women to eliminate the gender gap \\nin tertiary education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the education system capacities in Science and Technology.  \\n\\uf0b7 Rapidly expand ICT education at all levels  \\n\\uf0b7 Invest in teacher training.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade the quality of madrasas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve quality of vocational training institutions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase R&D spending.  \\n\\uf0b7 Help educational institutions adapt to the rapidly changing technology landscape driven by the \\nCOVID19 pandemic.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase  the use of evidence to inform decision -making about education technology.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop a Digital Learning Ecosystem by equipping each institution with all required digital \\ninfrastructure facilities through public -private -partnership.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop a centralized educ ational resource repository for curating all innovative solutions in \\npreparation for future emergencies  \\n \\nHealth  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen rural health centres with focus on mother, adolescent child and neo -natal care.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen immunization drive.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade and expand di strict tertiary public health care facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen quantity and quality of public medical staff through proper training.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expand higher medical education facilities for creating specialized health workforce.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expand and improve the quality of medica l, nursing and other medical technical education for \\nproducing quality doctors, nurse and other technical personnel . \\n\\uf0b7 Expand and strengthen modern family planning methods.  \\n \\nInformation Communications Technology ( ICT) \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Build ICT parks through PPP initiative,  \\n\\uf0b7 Install the second submarine cable connection for expanding high speed internet facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Complete the Second Phase of implementation of broadband internet connectivity under the \\nSouth Asia Sub -Regional Cooperation (SASEC) initiative.   \\n\\uf0b7 Expand investmen t in Research and Development.  \\n\\uf0b7 Facilitate PPP for ICT enabled services in e -Governance, agriculture, health, education, fintech \\nsectors.  \\n \\nPublic Administration  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen training programmes  for civil servants.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen public sector financial manageme nt.   \\n \\n279 \\n \\uf0b7 Modernis e civil service decision making through introduction of ICT in policy and decision \\nmaking, including e -procurement, e -service transactions, e -payments of wages, salaries, pensions, \\nsocial security and public procurement contracts.  \\n\\uf0b7 Institute tra ining programmes  to strengthen capacity of local government staff.  \\n3.7.4  Strengthen the Skill Base of the Service Sector  \\nThe highest priority is to adopt appropriate policies and investments to upgrade education and training \\nquality, including emphasis on  expanding tertiary education and science and technology.  The on-going  \\npolicy of partnering with the private sector is sound and should continue. There is, however, a need to \\nimprove the government’s oversight on quality standards for both public and priv ate educational \\ninstitutions. The Government should also adopt a grant program to facilitate advanced research in all high -\\npriority fields, but especially in science and technology.  The Government should also facilitate e -learning \\nand encourage partnershi p arrangements with international universities.  A special program that has helped \\nJapan, Korea and China to upgrade the skill base is through publicly -supported education programmes  in \\nscience and technology in top international universities. Bangladesh c an learn from this experience and \\ninitiate a similar focused program for high -level skills that are especially scarce.  \\nAnother major policy is to substantially enhance the public spending on Research and Development (R&D). \\nWhile the private sector is the m ain source of R&D spending at the enterprise level, innovation is mostly a \\npublic good and requires public funding. Research grants to top universities on specific areas of \\ndevelopment interest can be a great facilitator of innovation. Linking this researc h to the agricultural and \\nindustrial sectors can also leverage public resources with private funding.  Presently, the government spends \\na mere 0.15 GDP on R&D.  This has to sharply go up to reach 1 per cent  of GDP by FY2025, and 3 per \\ncent of GDP by 2030, and maintained at that level.  \\nA massive effort is needed to jump -start the training sector in Bangladesh.  The government adopted the \\nNational Skills Development Policy (NSDP) in 2011 with a view to upgrading the training system of \\nBangladesh. The NSDP br oadened the training strategy to include emphasis on public -private partnership. \\nA broad -based skill development program was adopted in 2013 with support from the Asian Development \\nBank (ADB 2013). Private sector training efforts have also increased, both through a range of skills -based \\ntraining and through employer -financed on the job training. Yet, the progress is slow. The efforts are simply \\ndwarfed by the scale of the skill development needs. In particular, focused initiatives are needed to upgrade \\nthe capabilities in export –oriented services like aviation, international shipping, tourism and ITC.   \\nMuch of the specialized skills in aviation, international shipping and tourism are best acquired through on -\\nthe-job training. Hence twining arrangements and  joint ventures with international partners are the best \\nways to impart these skills. The success of the RMG industry, for example, owes a lot to these types of \\ninternational partnership arrangements. The hotel industry that caters to international tourist s is also \\nbenefitting from similar arrangements, but the scope  for doing more is substantial.  The Government should \\nreview the related regulatory policies to promote these partnership arrangements including further \\nsimplifying work permits, visa requiremen ts, security clearances etc. of international technical experts.  \\nRegarding the ICT, special efforts are needed on a number of fronts. First is the need for expanding the \\nbreadth and depth of science and technology education in Bangladesh. The tertiary educ ation system is still \\nunduly biased in favour of general education.  The Government should support the growth of centres of   \\n \\n280 \\n excellence in science and technology thr ough grants and PPP initiative. Higher government spending on \\nR&D will also support the grow th of scientific education and research. Indeed, public spending on R&D is \\nthe most important driver of the growth of science and technology education and research in advanced \\neconomies.  Additionally, a long -term plan should be undertaken so that current s upply of 5,000 yearly IT \\ngraduates can be doubled in next 2 -3 years. Students from non -metropolitan cities with relatively low \\noverseas migration trends  should be encouraged to enrol.  To facilitate this, colleges under national \\nuniversities should be requi red to start IT education. Also, special education loan policy and scholarship \\nprogrammes  should be designed to encourage students for IT education enrolment. More industry \\ninvolvement will be ensured during academic programmes . \\n3.7.5  Strengthen Prudential  Regulations  \\nPrudential regulations are needed to protect consumer interest (all services), to protect depositor interests \\n(in banking), to protect state security (internet security) and to protect citizen safety (transport, food \\nindustry, health care). In  many areas, prudential regulations are in place. Nevertheless, there are important \\ngaps in regulatory framework for many services, especially in healthcare. Most importantly, the \\nimplementation capacity is weak.    \\nAccordingly, all regulatory authorities dealing with transport, trade, education, health, tourism and ITC \\nshould be asked to look at the adequacy and relevance of all concerned regulatory issues, both prudential \\nand enabling, with a view to upgrading and modernizing the regulatory framework for service sector . Proper \\nconsultation with stakeholders should be done to ensure correct diagnostics for reform. Lessons of \\ninternational experience should also be reviewed as necessary  \\nIn the area of prudential regulations, the emphasis should be on the fol lowing core aspects:  \\n\\uf0b7 Accreditation policies to ensure minimum quality standards in education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Licensing of health practitioners and private hospitals/clinics/labs to ensure health safety and \\nacceptable standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure accountability of healthcare profess ionals by establishing a grievance unit under the \\nMinistry of Health  and Family Welfare  that looks at public complaints for poor services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Licensing of food vendors in hotels, restaurants and other commercial food vendors to ensure \\nsanitation and health s afety standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strict monitoring of licensing and driving records of truck and bus drivers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Monitoring of road damage based on vehicle weight and loading norms.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strict implementation of safety features of commercial vehicles  \\n\\uf0b7 Strict inspection of all rive r vessels and monitoring of vessel loads.  \\n\\uf0b7 Require purchase of liability insurance for all healthcare providers and enterprises engaged in \\nthe transport industry.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enforcement of proper zoning laws for all commercial enterprises and strict implementation of  \\nparking regulations for all vehicles.  \\n \\nThe implementation of these regulations will require proper education through mass media as well as \\ncooperation with the private enterprises.  To minimize the administrative burden on public institutions, a \\nsystem of  financial penalty and revoking of licensing where deemed necessary will be instituted to provide   \\n \\n281 \\n an incentive for self -regulation. Implementation will be done through spot check. To ensure that the \\nregulations are not used by public agency staff to harass  the enterprise or increase the cost of doing business, \\nall licensing requirements will be administered online with established timelines for responses. An online \\ncomplaint registry will be established to redressal  enterprise grievances. Staff of public re gulatory agencies \\nwill be enhanced as necessary and will be given necessary training. Strict disciplinary actions will be \\nenforced for public service agents that are found in violation of ethical and service standards.  \\n3.7.6  Strengthen Public Institutions  \\nThe challenge of strengthening public institutions is pervasive in Bangladesh.  But this challenge is most \\nintensive in the public service sector , especially those public sector institutions that provide direct services \\nto the citizens.  These include heal th, education, transport and agriculture. Some public sector agencies \\nprovide only regulatory and policy support to private sector.  These include the Ministry of Finance, the \\nBangladesh Bank, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Land. But there a re many that provide \\nboth services. Together, these agencies are a part of public administration. Hence, a broad -based reform of \\npublic administration is a key to Bangladesh achieving higher income status. Of particular importance is \\nthe need to ensure the  efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory agencies dealing with services that are \\nsubject to global competition.  They require special skills and capacities. These include: The Civil Aviation \\nAuthority, the Ministry of Shipping, the Bangladesh Teleco mmunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) \\nand the Parjatan Corporation (Tourism Board). The capacity and effectiveness of each of these regulatory \\nagencies is critical to increase the international competitiveness of related services.  \\nThe reform of public  administration is a long -term endeavour.  It is complex, politically sensitive and time \\nconsuming.  So, a pragmatic reform strategy is needed.  One possible approach is to start incrementally \\nfocusing on areas that are not very controversial and adopt a p hased approach for the more complex \\ninstitutional reforms. Three broad -based initiatives that can yield considerable long -term benefits are: \\ndigitization of public administration; public financial management reforms and a comprehensive training \\nstrategy fo r public administration staff. The digitization could be of especial benefit to tackle corruption \\nproblems upfront. Adoption of e -procurement, e -payments, and e -service delivery can be instrumental in \\nimproving the accountability of public administration a nd reducing corruption. The Government has \\nalready initiated reforms and adopted specific programmes  in each of these areas but progress is slow.  For \\neach of these three areas, a time -bound action plan with performance indicators of progress should be \\nadopted.  Progress should be monitored at the cabinet level with each line Minister and Secretary \\nresponsible for implementation.   \\nIn terms of basic service delivery, a key reform is the devolution of health and education servic es to the \\nlocal governments.  This is admittedly a politically sensitive and contentious reform; but its  implementation \\nis essential if Bangladesh is to aspire to achieve high -income status by FY2041.  The process needs to start \\nnow as implementation will take time. The devolution will need to be broadly defined to include: reform \\nof the legal framework that clearly delineates the responsibilities by levels of government, avoids \\ncontentious overlaps of responsibilities and accountabilities; fiscal decentralization that enables appropriat e \\nsharing of public revenues in line with devolved responsibilities; capacity building and training; and a \\nframework of accountability for performance. There are ample international experiences that Bangladesh \\ncan learn from in developing its devolution st rategy.    \\n \\n282 \\n 3.7.7  Skills for employment and entrepreneurship  \\n\\uf0b7 Close the gap between demand and supply:  This will entail skills retraining for lifelong learning, \\njob redesign, establishment of inclusion and diversity in the workforce and government support in \\nmatching education with employment policies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Support a systems approach for entrepreneurship and employment:  Ensure whole of society \\napproach that benefits the most marginalized and vulnerable and ensures a sustainable, meaningful, \\nevidence -driven approach to transforming employment and self -employment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Advance a sector -oriented approach to experimentation and adaptation: Sector strategies for \\nadaptation, involving the key industry bodies, and combining support for adoption of new \\ntechnologies, new business methods and models, and new skills. Encourage experimentation, \\nparticularly with incentive models for different stakeholders, to arrive at the right strategies.  \\n\\uf0b7 National adaptive collective intelligence system: Pool different sources of knowledge to help \\nBangladesh build labour  market resilience.  \\n\\uf0b7 Create space for public -private cooperation on financing, support to the innovation \\necosystem, demand -creation (for both national and international markets) and ESG \\n(environmental social governance) investment: This will help to effectively engage the private \\nsector, achieving greater clarity in terms of its role –including access to finance, business incubation \\nand acceleration services – as well as a shared responsibility and accountability towards building a \\nresilient and sustainable future of work in Bangladesh.  \\n3.8 INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SERVICE SECTOR  \\nMuch of the investment in service sector  will come from the private sector. The improvements in regulatory \\nand incentive policies will spur the expansion of p rivate d omestic and foreign investment.  Yet, \\ncomplementary public investments in fixed infrastructure will be a critical determinant for expansion of \\nprivate investment, value -added, employment and exports of services.  \\nTo secure the modernization of the service sector  both public and private investment will need to go up as \\na share of GDP. In the indicative projections (Table 3.10), total investment requirements in services will go \\nup from 15.2 per cent  of GDP in FY2021 to 18.6 per cent  in FY2025.  Public investment in service sector \\nincreases from 4.2 per cent  of GDP in FY2021 to 4.6 per cent  in FY2025, whereas private investment moves \\nup from 11.0 per cent  of GDP in FY2021, to 14.0 per cent  in FY2025. Most of the public investment will \\nbe in physical infr astructure and facilities related to transport, ICT, education, health facilities, housing, \\nurban services, sports and recreation and public administration. Private investment on its part will focus on \\nproviding direct services in health, education, touris m, ICT, shipping, aviation, road transport, housing and \\na range of other services. Along with reforms of regulations and incentives for private investments, these \\ncomplimentary public investments will be necessary to spur the expansion of private investmen t in direct \\nservice provision.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n283 \\n Table 3.10: Investment Requirements of the Service Sector  \\n(Taka in Billion, 2021 Prices)  \\n FY2021  FY2025  \\nPublic  1335  2132  \\nPrivate  3475  6478  \\nTotal  3610  6944  \\nPublic (% of GDP)  4.2 4.6 \\nPrivate (% of GDP)  11.0 14.0 \\nTota l (% of GDP)  15.2 18.6 \\nSource: GED  Projections  \\n    \\n \\n284 \\n     \\n \\n285 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 4:  \\nAGRICULTURE  \\n    \\n \\n286 \\n     \\n \\n287 \\n CHAPTER  4 \\nSTRATEGIES FOR AGRICULTURE AND  \\nWATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  \\n4.1 INTRODUCTION  \\nThe agriculture sector has been one of the important drivers of growth and rural de velopment, accounting \\nfor almost 14 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and providing employment opportunities for \\nmore than 40 per cent of the country’s workforce. Despite the sector’s continued expansion, its relative \\nsignificance in the overall  output has been subject to a secular decline following the stylised fact of \\ndevelopment in which the rest of the economy (manufacturing and services) starts to play a much more \\ndominant role. As an agriculture -dependent economy at independence when agricu lture accounted for over \\nhalf of the economy, Bangladesh has made great strides forward in diversifying its economic activities \\ntowards industry and services. Putting aside the relative significance, however, agricultural growth has \\naccelerated from an ave rage annual rate of less than 2 per cent during the 1970s -1990s to around 3.0 per \\ncent in the 2000s and to 3.5 per cent in the next decade. Marginal farmers and landless workers in the \\nagriculture sector constitute a major part of the population living bel ow the poverty line and thus the \\nstrategic importance of agriculture in meeting food and nutrition security and providing livelihood s for a \\nsubstantial part of the population deserves a special attention.  \\nDespite its impressive progresses, Bangladesh still  faces formidable challenges in ensuring food and \\nnutrition security for its growing population. These challenges emanate from, inter alia, continuing \\npopulation growth, deceleration in the growth of agricultural productivity, increasing income inequality,  \\nincreasing rate of urbanization and growing concern about food safety. While increasing income and \\nurbanization have led to some dietary diversity, cereals still account for about 70 per cent of the dietary \\nintake suggesting that a rapid diversification i n agricultural production will be needed to support the process \\nof economic development in the country. The on -going process of climate change can also have serious \\nimpact on food production in Bangladesh. Increased salinity in the coastal areas may also a lter the \\nnutritional contents of foods including rice which may become deficient in zinc and other micronutrients  \\ntogether with less volumetric production . \\nDue to  the outbreak of COVID -19 global pandemic, the role of agriculture and its sustained growth in  \\nensuring food security received a n emergency  renewed attention. Globally, different strategies, such as \\nlarge -scale  shutdown of economic activities, border closures, and restrictions on movements, etc., were \\nadopted to contain the spread of Coronavirus. H aving achieved food self -sufficiency, Bangladesh did not \\nhave to face a crisis of food shortage. Nevertheless, economy wide  lockdown measures have significantly \\naffected agricultural supply chains and the food consumption behaviour of poor and vulnerable g roups \\ndealing with the crisis that resulted in a massive temporary unemployment. The crisis seriously impeded \\nfarmers’ market access for procuring raw materials and hiring labourers, destroyed underdeveloped \\nproductive capacities particularly in poultry an d dairy sub -sectors, and hindered them from selling their \\nproducts, resulting in increased levels of food loss and waste to cause concern for nutrition and food \\nsecurity. The duration of the crisis and the subsequent recovery process could take several yea rs, according \\ndifferent multinational organizations such as OECD, IMF and World Bank. The supply chain in agriculture   \\n \\n288 \\n being more complex, and involving a significant time lag for production, the disruption would have a \\npotential bearing on food security fo r a longer period. Therefore, shielding the agriculture from the \\nvulnerabilities arising from the COVID -19 crisis is pivotal to cope with the immediate shocks as well as \\nfor the medium - to long -term food security. A short -to-medium term policies and strate gies needed to meet \\nthe challenges and to restore food security  and improve nutrition security .  \\nAgainst the backdrop of the above, this chapter focuses on agriculture, which is a key determinant of food \\nsecurity and nutrition from the supply side, and the  all-important issue of water resource management, \\nwhich is the most important input to agriculture, but has much wider ramifications linked to climate change \\nand natural disasters.  Proper management of water resources is critical to lower vulnerability o f the rural \\npoor and protect their livelihood. Food security issues are discussed in Chapter 14 in the context of social \\nprotection and social welfare strategies.   \\n4.2 AGRICULTURE SECTOR PROGRESS UNDER THE 7FYP  \\nThe development vision for agriculture in the 7th Plan was to ensure food and nutritional security, \\nenhancement of sustainable intensification and diversification of climate resilient agricultural production \\nwith increased commercialization, and livelihood improvement through technological innovations; \\nstrengthening research and extension system; developing supply chain extension of agricultural products; \\nand linking the farming community with markets, both local and global. The major focus was centred  on \\nconsolidating and expanding the productivity gain s already achieved in food grain production as well as \\ndesigning policies, strategies and actions to accelerate the crop diversification and commercialization \\nprocess by increasing local and export market opportunities by the farmers and other stakeholders . \\nThe largely subsistence nature of operation with very low labour productivity makes it difficult to secure \\nand sustain high growth performance of the agriculture sector. In the first two years under the 7FYP , the \\nsector had seen growth rates lower than t he targets (Figure 4.1).  However, since then, the sector performed \\nbetter than expected. During the first four years of implementation of the 7th Plan, the sector grew at an \\naverage annual rate of 3.5 per cent against the target of 3.3 per cent.

During the 7th plan, the share has contracted \\nby 2.35 percentage points to reach 13.65 per cent in 2018 -19. In 2018 -19, the sector, however, still \\naccounted for 35.2 per cent of total employment in the country. Most of the peo ple involved in agricultural \\nproduction are marginal or landless farmers. Around 60 per cent of the employed women were engaged in \\nagriculture.  \\n4.3 CROP SUBSECTOR  \\nBangladesh has made remarkable progress in domestic food production, which almost doubled during  the \\nlast two decades. Along with expanding production, per capita availability of food items increased \\nsubstantially (Table 4.2). Availability of food grains per capita declined slightly compared to the level of \\n2010 -11, but it was accompanied by a sharp rise in the per capita availability of fish, meat and milk, \\nindicating diversity in the diet taking place. Per capita availability of potato, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables \\nalso increased considerably. Bangladesh, in fact, is a surplus producer of two foo d items: rice and potato. \\nThe government policies in favour of agriculture and food security are attributable to this success of rising \\nper capita availability of food items. Domestic production and per capita availability of pulses declined \\nsignificantly between 2010 -11 and 2017 -18. One possible reason could be the low yield rate compared to \\nother non -cereals. Bangladesh has long been dependent on import of pulses and oilseeds (edible oil) as \\ndomestic production constitutes a small share in the availabilit y of these food items. Also, the relative prices \\nof other crops could have also resulted in lower acreage allocation in favour of pulses.    \\n \\n290 \\n Table 4.2: Per Capita Availability of Food Items (gm/capita/day)  \\nItems  2004 -05 2010 -11 2017 -18 \\nFood grains (rice and wheat)  495 638 634 \\nPotato  108 153 168 \\nPulses  10 13 7 \\nOilseed  10 15 16 \\nVegetables  35 57 70 \\nFruits  68 65 78 \\nFish 41 53 74 \\nMeat  21 35 125 \\nMilk  42 55 162 \\nSource: BBS, DLS, DOF  \\nActual consumption of food is the real indicator of availability of and ac cess to food for the people. The \\nnational household income and expenditure survey shows that per capita food consumption had risen until \\n2010 and then fell marginally ( Figure 4.2). The per capita consumption of rice is on a secular decline \\ndepicting the di etary diversity inconsistent with the increased availability non -rice items as mentioned \\nabove.  \\nFigure 4.2: Changes in Total Food and Rice Intake in Bangladesh, 1991 -2016  \\n          \\n           Source: Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, BBS.  \\nIt is w orth pointing that per capita calorie intake decreased, however, from 2266 kcals in 1991 -92 to 2210 \\nkcals in 2016, with some minor fluctuations during the period. The highest calorie consumption was 2318 \\nkcals in 2010, but even that level of consumption wa s lower than the desirable level of consumption of \\n2430 kcals per/cap/day. The lower consumption of calorie may partly be attributed to the fact that people \\nshifted some consumption away from the calorie -dense food rice to other foods. Per capita protein i ntake \\nin 2016 was 63 grams/day which was moderately higher than the desirable intake of 58 grams. It is generally \\n  \\n \\n291 \\n held that in presence of calorie deficiency in the diet, the available protein may be converted into calorie, \\nso that a person with gross prot ein sufficiency may be rendered protein deficient in net term.  \\n4.3.1  Performance of Crop Sub - Sector under 7FYP  \\nBangladesh has made substantial progress in increasing food production and thereby improving food \\nsecurity over the past three decades. The 7th Plan stipulated the production target for major food items in \\nconsistence with the perspective plan 2021. By 2019 -20, Bangladesh had already achieved the production \\ntargets for all crops but wheat (Table 4.3). The uses of high yielding variety ( HYV ) seeds  along with \\ngovernment interventions and favourable  monsoon seasons contributed to this success. Wheat  production \\nhas decreased due to the occurrence of wheat blast  in 2016 -17. \\nTable 4.3: Production Targets of Selected Agricultural Crops in 7FYP and Achiev ements (million \\nMT/ million bale s for jute)  \\n Performance  Target  \\n2021   2015 -16 2016 -2017  2017 -18 2018 -19 2019 -20 \\nRice  34.71  33.80  36.28  37.36  38.70  36.81  \\nWheat  1.35 1.31 1.1 1.15 1.25 1.40 \\nPotato  10.30  10.21  9.74 10.65  10.92  10.34  \\nOil Seeds  1.00 1.06 0.97 1.06 1.15 0.52  \\nPulses  1.01 1.03 1.04 0.94 1.05 0.31 \\nMaize  2.76 3.52 3.89 4.7 5.40 1.85 \\nVegetables  15.26  16.04  15.95  17.25  18.45  n.a. \\nJute 7.56 8.25 8.89 7.44 6.82 n.a. \\nSource: DAE (2020), Ministry of Agriculture and PP2021  \\nThe 7th Plan put much  emphasis on agricultural productivity to sustainably increase production. Over time, \\nthe yield rates of major agricultural products have increased but these still lag many comparable countries.  \\nFrom only 1.711 mt/ha in 1991, the paddy yield rate increase d at a rate of 2.634 per cent per annum to reach \\n3.23 mt/ha in 2018. Among the three paddy growing seasons, growth in productivity is more pronounced \\nfor Aus (3.205% per annum), followed by Boro (2.071% per annum) and Aman (1.893% per annum) \\n(Figure 4.3). The recent policy shifts towards paddy cultivation, use of stress tolerant HYV seeds, and \\nincreasing use of balanced chemical fertilizers and modern technology including agricultural mechanization \\nto some extent played an important role in boosting yield g rowth.  \\nWith only a couple of exceptions (e.g. rubber and papaya), the yield rate for all major crops significantly \\nincreased. Some of the crops showing notable yield growth performances are maize among the cereals, \\npigeon peas among the pulses, garlic and  onion from the category of spices and fruits like mangoes, guavas \\nand melons. Despite these improvements , Bangladesh still has low  yield rates in many crops in the world.  \\nFor instance, although Bangladesh is the world’s second and third largest jute and p addy producer, it ranks, \\nrespectively, 7th and 44th in terms of the crop yield. Even for maize, the crop with the highest yield growth \\nrate, Bangladesh ranks 26th in the world. In this backdrop, increasing productivity will be a major focus \\nduring the 8th plan.     \\n \\n292 \\n Figure 4.3: Yield Rate Trend of Major Food Items (Mt/Ha)  \\n  \\n  \\nSource: Background paper of 8th plan.  \\n4.3.2  Challenges in the Crop Sub -Sector  \\nSome of the current and future challenges are linked to rapid industrialization and associated declin e in \\nagricultural land. Availability of high -quality seeds, access to credit, inadequate investment in agriculture, \\nand vulnerability to climate change are also important challenges. Furthermore, the volatility in commodity \\nprices is one of the major issue s confronted by the farmers. This, in turn, leads to increasing production and \\nlarge postharvest loss, occasionally over 30 per cent. It will be difficult to sustain the growth of production \\nof high -value and labour -intensive crops unless investment is mad e in the postharvest management (a 10% \\nreduction of postharvest loss would add 10% additional food for the nation), processing and storage to \\nstagger marketing of the crops throughout the year to match the demand that remains stable across the \\nseason. In a ddition, it is also important to exploit international markets with investment in packaging, \\nSanitary and Phyto -sanitary Standards (SPS), and safe food production through Good Agricultural Practices \\n(GAP).  \\nMajor drivers of crop production have been the de velopment and diffusion of improved crop varieties  and \\ntechnologies , more efficient on-farm water management, crop management, and expansion of irrigation \\ninfrastructure – mostly shallow tube well based groundwater irrigation. In addition to modern varieti es of \\ndifferent crops, production technologies have been developed in the national agricultural research systems. \\nUse of non -urea fertilizer has increased because of government subsidies. However, the yield gap between \\npotential and actual yields of a crop  variety realised by farmers remains high.

The key challenges in crop agriculture are:  \\nLow productivity: Low productivity remains one of the major problems in agricu lture. Productivity can \\nbe enhanced through technological innovation and correcting market distortions. The Bangladesh \\nAgricultural Research Institute (BARI ), BINA, BJRI , Bangladesh Sugar crop  Research Institute (BSRI) \\nand Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Resear ch Institute (BWMRI)  and Bangladesh Rice Research Institute \\n(BRRI) has been working to develop new verities of stress tolerant  HYV products through innovation. Uses \\nof technology in agriculture sector have  substantially increased in recent years. However, many of the poor \\nfarmers have less or no access to modern agricultural technologies, causing a loss in productivity. To \\nenhance productive capacity,  the agriculture sector, a major technological breakthrough is the must.   \\nIn Bangladesh, the productivity o f rice and other crops is low and there are large yield gaps between \\nfarmers’ fields and research trials. The same is true for other agricultural commodities of fisheries and \\nlivestock sub -sector. The high yield gaps have significant implications on farm p roduction and profit, food \\nsecurity and ultimately, agricultural GDP. In this context, with the financial help from the World Bank, the \\ngovernment initiated the National Agricultural Technology Prgramme -Phase 2 Project (NATP 2) to \\ndisseminate different rice  yield gap minimization technologies. The project claims minimizing yield gaps \\nin the demonstration plots by 1.05 t/ha (through 25% yield increase over conventional farmer practices), \\n1.20 t/ha (22% yield increase) and 0.61 t/ha (17% yield increase) for Am an, Boro and Aus season, \\nrespectively. However, the widespread adoption of the technologies remains a concern, particularly when \\nthe extension services in the country is yet considered moderately efficient .  \\nThe agricultural cropping intensity in Banglades h is 194 – meaning that on an average less than two \\nproducts are produced in a piece of land per year – which is low compared to many other countries including \\nChina, Indonesia and Vietnam. Increasing the current level of cropping intensity can help to increase \\nproductivity.  \\nInstitutional bottlenecks in research -extension -farmer linkage:  Evidence  shows  that agricultural R&D \\ninvestment plays an important role for increasing productivity and growth . There is a need for establishing \\neffective and strong coord ination  between research and extension linkages with a view to transferring new \\ntechnologies to the farmers, private sector entrepreneurs  and NGO, s.  Nonetheless, agricultural research \\nhas been a neglected area with low budgetary allocation and comparative ly lower research and finan cial \\nfacilities for scientists. A Sub -Assistant Agricultural Officer (SAAO) serves on an average 1,162 farm \\nholdings, which is an impossible target (BBS, 2019; DAE, 2017). Increasing spending on research and \\nextension along with promoting good governance and accountability of the public institutions are therefore \\nimportant for promoting productivity.  \\nClimate change and associated challenges: Bangladesh is one of the top nations  that are most vulnerable \\nto climate change although i t has very little contribution to greenhouse  gases emission. Bangladesh has \\nalready been suffering a lot in coping with the adverse effect of global warming. Future climatic variability \\nand its associated events are predicted to have more adverse effects o n agriculture and living standards of \\nthe citizens, particularly for those who are poor and earn livelihood from agriculture (World Bank 2018).  \\nThe most important effect of climate change is the rise in temperature caused by greenhouse gas emission. \\nIt has been predicted that the rise of mean annual temperature will be 3.3°C  over the century. Presently, sea \\nlevel is rising at a rate of 3.3(± 0.4) mm/yr due to added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the   \\n \\n294 \\n expansion of seawater. This phenomenon wi ll directly affect Bangladesh because of its low elevation and \\nconnection with the Bay of Bengal. A large area of agricultural cropping land will go under water in coming \\nyears due to the rising sea level.  On the other hand, intrusion of saline water caus ed by rise in sea level will \\ndirectly affect the livelihood of the people living in coastal region. Climate change is expected to increase \\nthe risk of salinity through two mechanisms. First, the deltaic regions and wetlands are exposed to the risks \\nof sea -level rise and increased inundation causing salinity intrusion into irrigation systems and groundwater \\nresources. Second, higher temperatures would lead to excessive deposits of salt on the surface, further \\nincreasing the percentage of brackish groundwater . \\nAs a direct consequence  of climate change, the timing and intensity of rainfall is changing, that will \\nadversely affect the livelihood of the people especially the farming households. With the changing \\ntemperature, there would be increased monsoon rainfa ll, but decreased dry season rainfall. The situation \\nwill cause serious disruption in agriculture by creating shortage of water during the dry and excessive water \\nin the wet season. Increased flood risk to rice and other summer crops in Kharif (pre -monsoon  & monsoon) \\nseasons are likely to interact with other climate change impacts on the Boro (post -monsoon) rice crop \\nproduction, leading to substantial economic damages (Yu et al. 2010). To meet the excess maintenance and \\nrepairing cost as well as constructio n of infrastructure to protect livelihood will require maintaining a \\nresilience fund. Also, it will require significant amount of money for habitation of the people affected by \\nthe impacts of climate change.    \\nDegrading natural resource base and depleting  ground water: The limited natural resources of the \\ncountry are  further degrading. The soil fertility is low to medium with organic material content being \\nparticularly low. Nitrogen and Phosphorus deficiency in soil is known for many years now.  At present,  \\nnitrogen constitutes about 75 per cent of total fertilizer nutrients used in Bangladesh. Such excess Nitrogen \\nuse may enhance mineralization of organic matter which may decrease carbon content in soil and increase \\nCO 2 emission. Since 2008 -09, Bangladesh i s aiming to balance urea and non -urea fertilizer subsidies. This \\nhas raised urea prices  for some period and then remained stable; whereas prices of TSP, MoP and DAP fell \\nand consequently urea sales reduced and the use of other three fertilizers increased ( Table 4.4).  \\nTable 4.4: Fertilizer Price and Sales over the Year s \\nPeriod  Price (tk/kg)  Sales (lakh MT)  \\nUrea  TSP MoP  DAP  Urea  TSP MoP  DAP  \\n2008/09  12 40 35 45 25.33  1.75 0.85 0.18 \\n2009/10  12 22 25 30 24.09  4.32 2.75 1.37 \\n2010/11  12 22 15 27 26.55  5.91 5.07 3.31 \\n2011/12  20 22 15 27 22.96  6.41 6.03 4.03 \\n2012/13  20 22 15 27 22.47  6.54 5.71 4.34 \\n2013/14  16 22 15 27 24.62  6.85 5.76 5.43 \\n2014/15  16 22 15 25 26.38  7.22 6.4 5.97 \\n2015/16  16 22 15 25 22.91  7.30 7.26 6.58 \\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture (2020 ). \\nProper irrigation is  a key to agricultural production. The sector alone consumes 70 -80 per cent of the total \\nfresh water used in the country. This has a critical implication from the environmental perspective. The \\ngroundwater table in the northern distr icts is dropping fast (Figure 4.4). This will have severe implications \\non the availability of irrigation and drinking water in future. The irrigation effici ency in the country is very   \\n \\n295 \\n low– in the range 30 –40 per cent, implying that a huge amount of the wat er is wasted. Along with several \\nother reasons, the conventional irrigation pricing system where farm ers pay area -based fixed charge  has a \\nrole beh ind this level of inefficiency. Volumetric water pricing is practiced in Barind Multipurpose \\nDevelopment Auth ority (BMDA) areas and in some other Bangladesh Agricultural Development \\nCorporation (BADC) areas. In this arrangement, a farmer can minimize irrigation cost by reducing water \\nconsumption  keeping the production level intact . A farmer may also feel encourag ed for crop \\ndiversification, since compared to paddy, other crops require less water.  Therefore, efforts should be taken \\nto increase the acreag e of non -rice crops during dry B oro season in order to minimize ground water \\nextraction and to increase the produ ction of high value crops like pulses, oilseeds , spices and vegetables for \\nensuring food and nutritional security with generation of income through processing and marketing.  \\nFigure 4.4: Groundwater Table Depth in Northern Bangladesh  \\n \\n                   Source: FPMU  \\nDeclining availability of agricultural land: With increasing population and economic growth, demand \\nfor land outside agriculture is increasing and agricultural land is diverted to non -agricultural uses. Pressure \\non agricultural land has been in creasing for housing, roads, etc., resulting in a decline in the cultivated area \\nat an annual rate of 0.73 per cent. The total available arable land stood at 8.5 million hectares (Mha) in \\n2020. If the rate of reduction continues, the country will be left w ith 8.00 Mha ha by 2025. Climatic and \\nenvironmental factors such as water logging, depletion of ground water and soil fertility, erosion, and \\nsalinity also contribute to the process. For instance, in the southern region, about 170,000 ha of agricultural \\nland have been degraded in the last three decades due to increased salinity (MoA and FAO, 2011). \\nRiverbank erosion accounts for about 40 per cent of the land loss in about 1,200 km of riverbanks. This \\nalso results in the topsoil being washed away and replace d by sand. Availability of arable land will thus be \\na major issue in the coming years.  \\nDifficulties in accessing credit: Agricultural credit plays an important role in sustainable development of \\nthe sector. It is a key to poverty alleviation, livelihood d iversification for small farmers and traders which \\ncan contribute to overall agricultural diversification. Research has shown a positive relationship between \\ninstitutional credit and agricultural production and therefore an expansion in the disbursement of  \\nagricultural credit, particularly to small farmers, is a priority. However, farmers of Bangladesh face \\n-8.5-8.0-7.5-7.0-6.5-6.0-5.5-5.0-4.5-4.0-3.5\\n1982\\n1984\\n1986\\n1988\\n1990\\n1992\\n1994\\n1996\\n1998\\n2000\\n2002\\n2004\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016GWT Depth (m)\\nGWT Depth Poly. (GWT Depth)  \\n \\n296 \\n difficulties in accessing credit for agricultural production, crop diversification, processing, value addition \\nand marketing. The lack of availability o f funds and high collateral requirements pose as major hindrances.   \\nFood safety and nutrition : Food borne diseases are now becoming a concern for health and nutrition \\nsecurity. Pesticides are used indiscriminately in agriculture, particularly in vegetable  crops, and thus \\npesticides residue in food bear important health hazards. Harmful agro -chemicals and/or excessive doses \\nof preservatives are also used in food items. Food poisoning is however preventable following  the principles \\nof food hygiene  and by imp arting the training to the persons involved in food processing and food business. \\nFood safety should be ensured from production to consumption. Poor people, particularly infants and \\nchildren, mostly suffer from under nutrition , which is the outcome of insu fficient food with low vitamins \\nand minerals intake. Under nutrition  leads to underweight, stunt ing, and dangerously thin physical structure \\n(wasting) for one’s age. Across the world, under nutrition  causes 45 per cent of deaths of children under \\nfive.  \\nStorage, agro -processing and commercialis ation: Farmers’ access to storage  well developed agro -\\nprocessing and improved value chain facilities are critical for agricultural promotion. Low product prices \\nduring harvest are always a concern for farmers. The lim ited available storage facility not only raises quality \\nconcern but also reduces farmers’ profits. A substantial amount of food losses occurs at different stages in \\nthe post -harvest period due to inappropriate handling, storage, processing and marketing. F ood processing \\nhas a great potential provided that a good quality control is enforced. To ensure that their production and \\nexport potential are fully realized, there is a need for investing in appropriate manufacturing capacities and \\ninfrastructural facili ties. Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) also needs  to be employed for production and \\npost-harvest management.   \\nOther challenges:  There exists several other challenges in crop subsector including, among others, slow \\nagricultural/farm mechanization; ineffic iency in the irrigation system; low quality and adulterated \\nagricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers and pesticides) marketed by unscrupulous traders; intrusion of saline \\nwater into the groundwater table;  non -availability of farm gate price support for the  producers; reducing \\nthe current yield gap in crop; increasing land, labour  and water productivity; enhancing product quality and \\nfood safety; improving postharvest management and reducing postharvest loss;  improving the energy \\nmanagement in agriculture: use of solar energy, organic fertilizer, agricultural waste management, etc.  \\n4.3.3  Strategies for Crop Sub -Sector during  the 8FYP  \\nThe development vision for crop sector under the 8th Five Year Plan is to ensure food security and nutrition \\nthrough increasi ng productivity; minimizing yield gap; stabilizing price of agricultural products; improving \\nfarmers’ profitability and securities; diversification of crop products towards climate -resilient production; \\nstrengthening agricultural supply chains; increasing commercialization through uses of information and \\ncommunication technology (ICT); easing credit facilities for small farmers; escalating HRD for undertaking \\nfrontier research and delivery services; and ensuring efficient utilization of natural resources. T he major \\nfocus of the Plan in the sector, therefore, focuses on consolidating and expanding the productivity gains \\nthrough designing policies, strategies and actions to accelerate the crop diversification and \\ncommercialization process by increasing local a nd export market opportunities for the farmers and other \\nstakeholders. The major objectives of the crop sub -sector for the 8FYP are to:    \\n \\n297 \\n \\uf0b7 Increase availability of food, right to food and purchasing power by increasing productivity and \\nproduction of crops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase farmers\\' capability and income through institutional infrastructure development and efficient \\ntechnology services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Adopt and implement food production plans to meet the needs of nutritious, safe and demand -driven \\nfoods.  \\n\\uf0b7 Restore and develop the agric ultural supply chain aftermath of COVID -19 crisis; minimise the impact \\nof COVID -19 for smooth agriculture growth and ensure food security after the crisis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop agricultural research for promoting export of products through coordination with local and \\ninternational partner organizations; modernize agricultural research, education, extension, input \\nmanagement and develop skilled manpower for sustainable technology innovation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide assistance to the farmers in increasing agricultural production and ensu ring marketing \\nfacilities of agricultural commodities and obtaining fair prices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduce precision a griculture and synchronise farming, reduce the use of physical labour  and \\nintroduce cost saving farming system through farm mechanization.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure sustaine d agricultural growth through more efficient and balanced utilization of land, water \\nand other resources, and encourage more use of surface water for irrigation and reduction of pressure \\non ground water while expanding irrigation facilities through improvi ng existing irrigation system and \\nrelated infrastructures.  \\n\\uf0b7 Installations of solar panels for small scale irrigation in rural areas will be a priority.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote gradual shifting of high water - consuming crops to low water consuming high value crops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introd uce nanotechnology in agriculture promote science -led agriculture technology systems and \\nencourage research and adoption of modern agricultural practices for development of drought, \\nsubmergence and saline prone agriculture considering water and time econom y, adaptation to climate \\nchange, proper use of genetically modified technology in agriculture, and promote adoption of modern \\nagricultural practices in dry land, wetland, hills and coastal areas including use of environment friendly \\ngreen technologies (e.g . IPM, INM, AWD, etc.) and climate -smart/resilient technologies; introduce \\nsalinity, submergence and other stress tolerant varieties specially in the Southern regions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Create new sectors of agricultural commercialization and employment generation through v alue \\naddition, improving supply chain, demand -driven and export -oriented agricultural development. And,  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure proper use of water resources through active participation in the formulation of strategies and \\ntheir proper implementation through inter -ministe rial/inter -agency coordination.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance  farmers’ income and livelihood  through Holistic Farming System Approach (HFSA) with \\nspecial emphasis on productivity enhancement of homestead areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintain plant genetic resources, genetic diversity of seeds of foo d crops and medicinal plants and \\nconserve local and land races for protection from extinction.  \\n \\nTargets:  In order to enhance agricultural production and ensure food security, the 8FYP  targets to assure \\nthe supply of quality and high -yielding seeds for prod uction and continue and extend the supports to \\nfarmers.  The already attained self -sufficiency in staple food (rice) production will be maintained to meet \\nthe nutritional requirements of the huge population through supply of an adequate and diverse range o f \\nfoods. Diversification of agricultural production with high value crops, strengthening supply channels in   \\n \\n298 \\n the country, and ensuring credit for the small farmers should be the ideal targets for the country for the next \\nfive years.

Source: SRDI 2020  \\nAchieving the above objectives and targets will require undertaking a range of diverse activities. These \\nare briefly discussed below.  \\nPromoting sustainable agriculture and green growth:  Sustainability does not only have biophysical \\ndimension, which relates to use, preservation and enhancement of the long -term productivity of the resource \\nbase, but also has economic and social dimensions (Herdt and Lynam, 1998). An effective sustainable \\nagricultural system must be built on current achie vements. The approach will be to achieve and sustainably \\nmaintain high yields and farm profits without undermining the natural resource base. In earlier plan and \\nother policy documents, several tools and strategies such as organic farming, Integrated Pest Management \\n(IPM), Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) and others were identified and recommended. For \\nsuccessful adoption of these, the plan documents stressed on coordination and combined actions of different \\ngovernment ministries and agencies including MoA, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change \\n(MoEFCC ), Ministry of Land, Ministry of Water Resources and Local Govt. Division. However, the actual \\nadoption status has not reached the desired level. To offer farmers some benefits of adopting thes e \\nenvironment -friendly technologies, Economic and Policy Instruments (EPI) for ecosystem payment should \\nbe designed. For instance, compared to conventional urea, granular urea is less polluting and ensures higher \\nproductivity. To make it more popular, ther e can be greater incentives (e.g. higher subsidies) for using \\ngranular urea.  \\nSustainable agriculture and green growth in crop sector will be promoted through different policies. It will \\nbe planned and implemented in such a way that it will be resource con serving, socially supportive, \\ncommercially competitive and environmentally sound. The activities that will be promoted in this respect   \\n \\n300 \\n are: (1) fostering partnership among the public -private and international organizations to make sustainable \\nagriculture t o work, (2) protecting and conserving environment by promoting ICM, INM, IDM, IPM (sex \\npheromone, botanical pesticides, biological control, etc.), surface and rainwater utilization, use of solar \\nenergy in farm activities, (3) Capacity building will be targ eted at all segments of agriculture: farmers, \\nextension providers, dealers, distributors, entrepreneurs, agribusiness people, trainers and researchers (man, \\nwoman, youth will be the target groups) through knowledge and skill development, (4) improving rain -fed \\nagriculture, (5) technology transfer through farmers’ group approach, (5) protecting biodiversity (plant, \\nanimal, fisheries, pollinator, etc.), (6) promoting food safety, nutrition and dietary diversification, (7) \\nimproving natural resource management  (land, water and biodiversity), (8) Promoting agricultural exports, \\n(9) sustaining economic viability of farming practices, (10) creating enabling environment for the \\ninstitutions , (11) promoting farm mechanization, (12) exploiting newly accreted char and  coast land and \\npromoting seaweed cultivation . \\nEnsuring production of enough staples and diversifying to the non -crop sector: In line with the \\nprevious two plan documents, the 8FYP  should concentrate on maintaining self -sufficiency in the major \\nstaple prod uction through ensuring required increase and simultaneously diversifying the production \\nportfolio within and beyond the crop sector so that diversified foods are produced to meet the nutritional \\nrequirement for the country’s growing population in a sustai nable manner by covering people living in \\ndifferent agro ecological  zones.  \\nThe strategy requires research for area specific modern variety development and increasing productivity. \\nThe National Agricultural Research System (NARS) institutes and agricultural  universities need to play \\ncritical role in inventing relevant new technologies. The DAE will be responsible for farm level \\ndissemination of the new technologies. The MoA has to play the leading role for proper coordination among \\ndifferent ministries. In the case of rice, a short duration variety of Aus rice to avoid climatic uncertainty \\nduring the late summer is of upmost importance. Strategies are also needed for minimizing yield gap \\nthrough increasing productivity and using modern and appropriate technol ogies at the farm level.  \\nMore attention is needed for crop intensification in environmentally and economically vulnerable areas \\nsuch as the coastal zone, the Sylhet region and the char areas and in the northern poverty -stricken districts. \\nAnother strategy  should be to encourage farmers to devote ecologically favourable  months of the Boro \\nseason for growing high return non -rice crops leaving the remaining eight months for growing two rice crops.    \\nMinimising the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic:  In order to minimise the impact of pandemic on the \\nagriculture sector (not limited to the crop sub -sector only), the government, in the backdrop of the Covid -\\n19 fallout, announced a stimulus package of BDT 5,000 crore for farmers to boost agricultural production. \\nSmal l and medium -scale farmers, including those in the poultry and dairy sector and fisheries can avail the \\nloans available under this package at only four per cent interest rate. Farmers will benefit from these \\ninitiatives for the next three years. Small farm ers will be able to avail this loan without collateral. Apart \\nfrom this, an additional BDT 9,500  crore was allocated for fertilizer subsidies (as in the budget for FY2021) \\nas part of the government\\'s strategy to minimise the impact. Seeds worth BDT 150 cro re will be distributed \\namong affected farmers so that agricultural production would be continued.  \\n   \\n \\n301 \\n Boosting social protection programmes are critical to protect incomes and purchasing power, particularly \\nfor the most affected households. This is important  to ensure food security for the poor households. The \\nexisting cash and food transfer programme including VGD, VGF, and EGPP will also be expanded and \\nother new employment generating programmes will be initiated.    \\nThe success of stimulus packages depends  on the distributional efficiency and monitoring. A monitoring \\nbody will be established for the disbursement of loan from the stimulus and for monitoring its effective \\nimplementation. Besides, a long -term Crisis Management Fund should be established for th e agriculture \\nsector so that production and supply chains are not disturbed from any crisis. This fund will be applicable \\nfor crop, non -crop and fisheries subsectors. Besides, price stabilization policies should be adopted and \\nimplemented.  \\nEnsuring optima l use of water resources: Crop diversification is an effective tool for ensuring optimal \\nuse of water given that the water requirement for paddy is much higher than in other crops. For ensuring \\nirrigation efficiency, technologies that enhance  conveyance ef ficiency (e.g. buried pipe, \\nPVC/plastic/polythene pipe, etc.) and on -farm water use efficiency (e.g. drip irrigation, fertigation through \\ndrip irrigation system for the non -cereal crops, etc.) need to be promoted. As in BMDA areas, volumetric \\nwater pricing  that offers incentives to the farmers to rationalize water use will be promoted in areas under \\ndeep -tube wells. Tiered pricing – setting lowest price at that threshold level of water use – will further \\nencourage farmers in the Barind areas to rationalize water use.  \\nRational use of quality inputs: In Bangladesh , informal sources supply larger portion of the total \\nagronomic requirements. The Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), Department of \\nAgricultural Extension (DAE) and other governmen t agencies need to enhance their capability for \\nproducing more seeds. Their distribution channels also need to be improved so that farmers can access at \\nlower transaction costs. Extension programmes will be designed to encourage farmers to use \\nrecommended/ balanced doses of chemical fertilizers. The government has already adopted the policy of \\nrebalancing fertilizer subsidy policy in favour  of non -urea fertilizers. This has generated success in reducing \\nurea use and increasing use of non -urea fertilizers. Fu rthermore, strategies for extensive production and use \\nof organic/bio fertilizers, and proper utilization of soil guide and soil testing facilities will be developed and \\nimplemented.  \\nPromote measures to expand mechanization and value chain development:  Increased agricultural \\nwages particularly during the harvesting season has become a major concern in recent times. Agricultural \\nmechanization boosts productivity, reduces cost and contributes to farm efficiency. Strategies for credit and \\ntechnical support wi ll be developed to support the local machinery producers. Collaborative efforts are \\nneeded by public and private sectors in technology development and its diffusion. Technological progress \\nneeds to be supported by public and private investment s for irrigat ion, flood control  and drainage, and farm \\nmechanis ation, especially expansion of power tillers for land tilling , power threshing and processing as well \\nas milling  rice trans planters , rippers, tractors, and combine harvesters, etc. In line with the suggest ions \\nmade in the national agricultural, policies for the promotion of mechanization through cash incentives for \\nselected machineries at producer, manufacturer and farmer levels should continue.    \\n \\n302 \\n Land reform: Land reform has its implications beyond agricult ure as it  balances the power structure, both \\neconomic and political. It empowers the actual tillers of the soil, and organizes and enables them to seek \\ndevelopment  \\n However, its implementation requires strong political will and motivation. The rising agric ultural land \\nmarket has already created some equity benefits. To further facilitate the process, strategies are needed to \\nsafeguard of the tenants against eviction and granting them the right of pre -emption in land transfer. The \\ngovernment khas land needs  to be distributed among the landless and the marginal farmers. Automation of \\nland records and transfers will further reduce the associated transaction costs and anomalies. It is worth \\nmentioning that Ministry of Land is implement ing ‘Automation of Land Man agement Project’ and \\n‘Capacity Development of Land Records and Surveys to Perform Digital Survey Project’  in this regard . \\nPromoting urban agriculture through rainfed rooftop and vertical farming : Urban agriculture may \\npromote food security for urban househ olds. It is also a source of safe food for the urban people for whom \\nconventional farming is not possible. Urban agriculture also contributes to environmental sustainability, \\nbut that can only be pursued using rain harvesting water or with surface water no t using  underwater supply, \\nas it is less input intensive. Moreover, f or increasing productivity in urban agriculture, agricultural \\ntechnolog ical innovation is required to ensure sustainability of production. Research is also needed for \\nefficient fertilizat ion technology and eradication of plant pests and diseases. Technological innovation and \\ndissemination are also needed for the postharvest technology. Finally, linking urban agricultural products \\nwith the value chain will be important.  Expansion of vertica l farming can help attain food security for urban \\nas well as rural households by making use of small areas more efficiently. Private and/or public -private \\njoint enterprises can establish commercial vertical farming in urban areas. Using appropriate technol ogies, \\nvertical farming can commercially produce substantial amount of leafy vegetables in urban areas.  \\nCrop zoning and land use planning:  Considering the increasing demand for food production, it is an \\nessential task to promote optimum land use and its co nservation  for higher productivity and production . \\nThe seventh Plan stressed on crop zoning and land use planning, however, a little has been achieved. A \\ncomprehensive land use planning through integration of economic, ecological, social and cultural value s in \\nproduction will be given priority. The 8th plan will broaden emphasis on soil and water conservation, land \\ndevelopment, drainage and flood control, and reclamation programmes. Land use planning will be \\npromoted and production programmes will be manage d based on crop zoning.    \\nPromotion of precision agriculture:  For resource conservation and judicious use of inputs, the 8FYP will \\ngive more focus on Precision Agriculture (PA), which will ensure optimization of inputs use and \\nmaximization of returns whil e preserving resources and reducing environmental risks. Precision agriculture \\nwill be adopted wherever possible. Land levelling  with laser equipment, buried pipe irrigation, drip & \\nsprinkler irrigation, hydroponic culture of vegetables, bed planting, and use of USG & IPM are some of the \\nexamples of precision agriculture. This will save inputs, increase yield and profitability, and improve \\nenvironmental management.  \\nIntroduction and popularization of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP):  In a standard setting, \\ncertification and accreditation will continue to be the main focus for safe food production and marketing at \\nlocal and export markets. Protocol development for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) suitable for \\nBangladesh agro -ecological and socio -economic con ditions of Bangladesh should be the major priority.   \\n \\n303 \\n Introducing the GAP is an unfinished agenda of the 7th plan. There are four pillars of GAP: economic \\nviability, environmental sustainability, social acceptability and food safety and quality. Research and  \\nextension will put effort jointly to promote the process. Establishment of GAP will ensure: i) safety and \\nquality of food and other agri -products; ii) capturing new market opportunities for farmers and exporters; \\nand iii) better natural resources use, wor kers health and working conditions.  \\nIt would also be an important initiative to promote regenerative agriculture, which aims to capture carbon \\nin soil and aboveground biomass, reversing current global trends of atmospheric accumulation. At the same \\ntime, i t offers increased yields, resilience to climate instability, and higher health and vitality for farming \\nand ranching communities. Overall, it will ensure the resource use efficiency in agriculture along with \\nenvironmental sustainability and biodiversity c onservation. During the implementation of the 8th Plan \\nefforts will be made to promote and popularize regenerative agriculture among the farmers...  \\n Post-harvest management:  Bangladesh experiences seasonal surpluses in several agricultural \\ncommodities of p erishable in nature. Development of agro -processing facilities can prevent postharvest \\nlosses and enhance farmers’ income. The agro -processing industries are at present in their nascent stage of \\ndevelopment. Most of the technologies and facilities for hand ling, storage, processing and packaging of \\nfarm products and by -products are substandard and outdated as they cater primarily to the domestic market. \\nThere exists considerable underutilization of capacity as well. Agricultural research institutes like BARI  \\nand BRRI will carry out research on technology development for post -harvest management e.g. packaging \\nand agro -processing. Meanwhile, some technologies are already available with these institutes for the \\ndevelopment and growth of agro -processing industrie s in the country. Nevertheless, some specialized \\nextension activities could be delegated to the private sector such as those related to fruits and vegetables \\nenterprises. The process of supporting agro -business will be continued and strengthened during the  Eighth \\nPlan period.   \\nRefrigerated vans and cold storage:  Bangladesh produces huge quantity of fruits and vegetables round \\nthe year. Due to inappropriate methods of processing and marketing of agricultural products especially at \\nstorage and transportation  stage, farmers experience a significant amount of post -harvest losses. However, \\nit is possible to minimize the post -harvest losses by increasing product shelf life through maintaining cool \\nchain by using cold chambers in storage stage and refrigerated van s in transportation stage. A significant \\nchange in terms of shift in demand has been made during the recent past in the consumer end. Due to change \\nin consumer preferences, numbers of super shops or chain shops are increasing in Bangladesh. As a result, \\nthe demand for using cool chambers and refrigerated vans are also increasing. In addition, there is a great \\nimportance for storing and transportation of the exportable perishable vegetables and fruits. Recently, the \\nexports of agro -processed goods have incre ased which resulted in increasing demand for maintaining a cold \\nchain throughout. Developing the suitable storage and transportation capacities can ensure fair prices to the \\nproducers and can help maintain the demand -supply balance in the market for all se asons.  \\nStrengthening agro -processing:  The demand for processed agricultural products is increasing worldwide \\nwhich is reflected in the recent growth in the exports of agro -processed items from Bangladesh. Food \\nprocessing and dried food production have sig nificant prospects both in domestic market and foreign \\nmarkets. To ensure that the production and export potential are fully realized, the government will continue \\nits current commitment to investing in the relevant infrastructure and supporting manufactur ing of   \\n \\n304 \\n processed foods. Special attention will be given support initiatives relating to ready to cook fo od, halal food \\nexport, dried fruits, canned fruits and assuring quality phyto sanitary compliance.  \\nAgricultural research:  Research and development is th e key for enhancing productivity growth and \\ndiversification. In the 8FYP , emphasis will be given on agricultural research promotion, focusing on \\ndeveloping and refining technologies that will bridge yield gaps and promote diversification and \\nintensificatio n, community farming , sustainable natural resources management (e.g., rain water and river \\nwater harvesting for agricultural production), disease and pest management, development of \\nvarieties/species with postharvest technology of high value agricultural c ommodities,  frontier researches \\nlike genomics and phenomics, physiologial mechanisms regulating photosynthetic efficiency, polyshed and \\nnutrient dense culture, vertical farming,   mechanization, etc. It will also address climate change effects by \\nbreeding a nd introducing saline and drought tolerant, short duration varieties, high value commodities, and \\nlow-cost, high -impact post -harvest technologies. Furthermore, research on packaging, harvesting, food \\nprocessing, market intelligence, IPM, on -farm water mana gement, food technology, biotechnology and \\nbiosecurity will have special emphasis along with other contemporary issues. For this purpose, budgetary \\nallocation for research and extension should be expanded to at least 5 per cent of Agricultural GDP as \\nagain st 1.5 per cent of current allocation.  \\nDemand -led agricultural extension:  Transfer of technologies, diversification and intensification of crop \\nproduction program through appropriate extension services are of crucial importance. Technology \\nextension mappi ng will be done based on agro -ecological niches, prevailing productivity gap and regional \\nspecificity. The extension services must be able to render required technical advice and management \\nsupport at the appropriate time and place. Pluralistic extension a pproach will be adopted to enhance \\nproduction and productivity. Extension services will address skill gap, productivity gap and agricultural \\ndiversification for attaining food safety, dietary diversity and volume and value addition for agricultural \\ncommodi ties. Research -extension -farmers linkages will be further strengthened to achieve and sustain a \\nhigh level of productivity. Feedback mechanisms from farmers -extension -research linkages will be \\nestablished for possible solutions and taking back the results to the farmers for their field adoption. Further \\nstrengthening of these three -way linkages and communicati on among research, extension and farmers’ \\ncommunity will be made in the 8FYP for effective research -extension -farmer linkages. The technical \\ncommittee  and Agricultural Technical Committees (ATC), each covering 2 -6 districts in similar agro -\\necological zone (AEZ), will be strengthened. Agricultural extension together with nutritional awareness \\nprogrammes  will be strengthened. The following priority activi ties will be pursued in the 8FYP for \\nextension services:  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen ing research –extension –farmers linkages  \\n\\uf0b7 Formulation of programmes  to promote diversification on the basis of crop zoning and value \\naddition  \\n\\uf0b7 Expansion of small -scale irrigation technology an d surface water for irrigation  \\n\\uf0b7 Extension of Boro rice cultivation in southern Bangladesh  \\n\\uf0b7 Popularization of salt -tolerant varieties in the coastal region  \\n\\uf0b7 Diversification to high value crops in Barind tracts and hill districts   \\n\\uf0b7 Field monitoring for seed, pe sticide and fertilizer quality   \\n\\uf0b7 Organizing technology demonstration, field days, agricultural exhibition, etc.    \\n \\n305 \\n \\uf0b7 Adoption of decentralized extension approach, bottom up planning and micro planning  \\n\\uf0b7 Addressing all categories of farmers with special emphasis o n marginal, small, tenant and women \\nfarmers  \\n\\uf0b7 Development and promotion of environment friendly farming practices  ensuring good \\nagricultural practices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Easing agricultural credit facilities for small farmers and intermediaries  \\n\\uf0b7 Promotion of Rice Yield Gap Min imization (RYMG) techniques  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduc tion of  yield gap, knowledge gap and productivity gap by productivity enhancing \\ntechnology  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening human resources development programmes  of extension agencies  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening MIS and ICT -based knowledge management syst em and e -agriculture  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of Farmer’s Information and Advisory Centre  (FIAC) at all union level  Promotion \\nof commercialis ation of agriculture  \\n \\nIncreasing  women and youth participation in agriculture : Globally women have an increasing \\nparticipation  trend in agriculture and Bangladesh is no exception where more than half of the total \\nagricultural labour force is women and their participation is gradually increasing.  Likewise , youths are to \\nbe attracted in farming and allied activities through provisi on of introducing of incentives for inspiration \\nlike easing loans, and offering training as a new generation entrepreneur . Most of the cases, women are \\nengaged in seedling and post-harvest  activities. The 8FYP plan will focus on productive participation of  \\nwomen in agricultural employment and will seek to address the following issues, amongst others: (1) w age \\ndifferences between male and female in agriculture, (2) socio -economic backwardness and constraints that \\nwomen endure in a male dominated society, (3)  women’s access to institutions and facilities including \\nextension and credit services  and linkages with other services such as health and nutrition, , and (4) women’s \\naccess to markets and high value -added agriculture.  \\n4.4 LIVESTOCK SUB -SECTOR  \\nDuring the past three decades, the production of livestock – both ruminant and poultry – increased \\nsignificantly (Figure 4.5). Cattle, which consisted almost half of the total ruminant population until the \\nearly1990s, is replaced by small ruminants, particularly goats, wh ich is currently around 70 per cent of the \\ntotal livestock population. Total population remained almost unchanged, which may be attributed to the \\ngradual decline in the use of cattle as animal power in farming. Among poultry population, around 80 per \\ncent is chicken and the share remained almost unchanged.  \\nBangladesh has one of the highest cattle densities – 282 large ruminants/km2. But most of them trace their \\norigin to a poor genetic base. The  average weight of local cattle  ranging from 125 to 150 kg for cows an d \\nfrom 200 to 250 kg for bulls  falls 25 –35 per cent short of the average weight of all -purpose cattle in India. \\nMilk yields in Bangladesh are low: 200 -250 litres during a 10 -month lactation period against 800 litres for \\nPakistan, 500 litres for Indi a and 700 litres for all Asia.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n306 \\n Figure 4.5: livestock production in Bangladesh (numbers)  \\n  \\n       Source: FAOSTAT  \\n4.4.1  Performance of Livestock Sub -sector under 7FYP  \\nLivestock is a key component of the agricultural economy of Bangladesh. It contributed  to 1.47 per cent  of \\nGDP and 13.6 per cent of agricultural GDP in 2018 -19. During the first four years of the 7FYP, the sector \\nexpanded at an average annual rate of 3.4 per cent, which is considerably higher than that of the 6FYP of \\n2.8 per cent.  Livestoc k serves an essential role as a source of protein, employment generation, export \\nearnings, and provision of food security. Livestock resources play an important role in the sustenance of \\nlandless people, livelihood options for the rural poor families and a re potentially important for poverty \\nreduction.   \\nThe 7FYP objectives for the livestock sub sector were to promote sustainable improvements in animal \\nproductivity in the dairy sector, including increased product processing and value addition, and sustained  \\nimprovements in income and employment opportunities for the landless, small and marginal farmers, and \\nwomen in livestock rearing. The Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) is responsible to identify \\nthe livestock and poultry production constraint s at the national and farm level, seek solutions to those \\nproblems through multi and inter -disciplinary and inter -institutional research and to develop technologies \\nto help food and nutrition security, contributing to poverty alleviation, employment and in come generation, \\nand reduced environment pollution.  \\nDuring the 7FYP period, Bangladesh achieved self -sufficiency in meat production and near self -sufficiency \\nin the production of eggs (Table 4.7). The production of meat reached at 7.51 million MT in 2018 -19 – up \\nfrom 5.86 million MT in 2014 -15 (Figure 4.6, Table 4.7). Milk production during this time increased from \\n6.97 million MT to 9.92 million MT – an increase of 42 per cent, while production of eggs grew by 55 per \\ncent.

The following challenges are notable:  \\nDisrupted production and markets due to the COVID -19 pandemic: The livestock sub -sector has been \\naffected by the economic shutdown measures to contain the spread of COVID -19. Towar ds the fag end of \\nthe 7FYP, the virus -related disruptions caused the demand for poultry meat and milk to fall sharply, \\nnegatively affecting prices and the existing productive capacities in the sector. In rural areas, about 40 -50 \\nper cent decline in prices of milk, eggs and poultry were reported, causing huge economic loss for the \\nsmallholders. Many farmers reportedly stopped procuring new cycles of production of poultry birds and \\neggs which might have an impact on food and nutrition security in the coming d ays. The commercial dairy 024681012141618\\n2010-11 2014-15 2018-19\\nMeat (million MT) Milk (million MT) Egg (billion Piece)  \\n \\n308 \\n milk producers are at high risk. During the prolonged economic shutdown period, a huge amount of milk, \\nwhich was used in sweet shops and other food -processing firms, remained unsold, eventually causing \\nsupply -side shocks. Besides,  the production of feed for livestock and fisheries reportedly declined because \\nof the crisis in the supply of raw materials. If appropriate measures are not taken in helping with the recovery \\nprocess of the sector, the crisis could have long term implicat ions for livestock production, food security \\nand nutrition.  \\nLow productivity: Although in terms of number of live animals, Bangladesh ranks in the quintile of top \\n10 per cent for buffaloes, cattle, goats, chicken and duck, the yield rates of different liv estock products over \\nthe past three decades have remained stagnant. This implies that the production growth is mostly attributed \\nto increasing number of animal population. The productivity of all the major three types of livestock in \\nBangladesh is notably lower than those of neighbouring  countries such as Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan \\n(FAOSTAT, 2020).  \\nScarcity of quality feeds and fodders: Feeds and fodders are important inputs for livestock r earing. \\nNaturally grown grasses and crop residues are the mai n source of feed for cattle in Bangladesh. The shortage \\nof natural feed and high price of processed feed are major challenges for small holders raring livestock. \\nScarcity of land for fodder production, seasonal fluctuations in supply of feeds and fodder, l ow quality feed, \\nand poor husbandry practices – all add to the problem. The coastal region in the south used to be regarded \\nas a large source of natural feed as there are plenty of uncropped areas. However, in recent times, due to \\nsalinity, the scarcity of  grasses started in this region, resulting  in a decline in buffalo production. Increased \\nsalinity in coastal area is a potential threat to natural growth of grasses in the char lands for grazing of \\nanimals. The pastureland has reduced significantly all ove r the country due to cultivation of High Yielding \\nVarieties (HYV) of rice. Climate change is causing unusual behaviour in temperature, rainfall, flooding \\npattern etc., and affecting either natural growth or damaging the pasture grasses. Besides, adulterati on and \\ninadequate or lack of quality control system of commercial feed are identified as major challenges for \\nprocessed animal feeds, causing harm to animal and public health and nutrition as well.    \\nEmerging and re -emerging diseases: Occurring and re -occurring of diseases is a major concern  for \\nlivestock farming. Every year about 15 per cent of animal and 20 per cent of poultry die from different \\ndiseases causing a huge economic loss to the farmers. Anthrax, Haemorrhagic  Septicaemia (HS), Black \\nquarter (B Q), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in cattle and Peste de Petits Ruminants (PPR) and Goat Pox \\nin goats, New Castle Disease (ND), Infectious Bronchitis  (IBD) and Gumboro in chicken and Duck plague \\nand Duck Virus  Hepatitis in ducks are the major animal disease s in Bangladesh. The cattle and poultry also \\nsuffer from protozoan disease including Toxoplasmosis , amebiasis, giardiasis, leishmaniasis, \\ncryptosporidiosis, and parasitic infestation due to moist humid climatic condition in Bangladesh. Parasitic \\ndiseases c an be easily controlled by improving management and regular de -worming with appropriate \\nmedicine, which is not so much expensive. Almost all animals are infested with one or more parasitic \\ndiseases in Bangladesh. Nutritional disorders are common in livesto ck and poultry birds due to shortage of \\nfeeds and fodder and also due to lack of knowledge of the farmers.  \\nInsufficient veterinary and animal health care service: Veterinary and Animal Health Care Service are \\ninadequate in the country. Public veterinary se rvices are available at the upazil a level ; however, there is \\nshortage of veterinary and animal health care professional at the root level which is the major hub of \\nlivestock farming. The Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) is responsible for pro ducing   \\n \\n309 \\n vaccines for animal care. The quantity of vaccines is inadequate and the quality is also a major concern. \\nThe use of subsidies in vaccine production needs to be rationalized to encourage private investors. Quality \\ncontrol for standard vaccination ne eds to be developed for both local and imported varieties. The facilities \\nof disease diagnostic are also limited and there is a shortage of skilled manpower for this.  \\nLimited access to credit: Development of small and medium scale farms for animal and pou ltry rearing \\nrequire significant investment while access to credit for small holders in livestock is very limited and \\nrequires high collaterals. The following challenges in accessing credit facilities are notable: (i) insufficient \\nfunds; (ii) inappropriate ly packaged loans for production cycles of livestock; (iii) collateral requirements \\neffectively reducing credit access for smallholders, particularly for the poor; (iv) inadequate loan \\nsupervision; (v) insufficient training in financial management and busi ness planning (applies to both loan \\nproviders and takers); (vi) inadequate technical support; and (vii) smallholders’ vulnerability and risk from \\nnatural and man -made disasters.  \\nAdverse impacts of climate change and natural disasters: Climate change poses a threat to sustainable \\nlivestock development. The impact of climate change on livestock can be transmitted through (i) rise in the \\nsea level, which will inundate char lands reducing the grazing facilities, (ii) intrusion of saline water in \\ncoastal regions  will increase stress factors and therefore, will not be conducive for livestock rearing, (iii) \\nvegetation will be destroyed leading to a serious feed scarcity resulting in reduction of livestock population. \\nNatural disasters including cyclones, tidal surg es and flooding cause colossal damages to livestock. In the \\naftermath of such a disaster, productivity runs off due to shortage of animal feed and outbreak of diseases.  \\nOther challenges: The underdeveloped marketing system for livestock products is conside red as a major \\nconstraint for the development of this sector. The marketing network and information system for dairy milk \\nhas not been developed in rural areas. Production and prices mostly depend on the local demand and supply \\nconditions and are not integ rated with a comprehensive nationwide marketing network. Among other  \\nchallenges, limited knowledge and technical skills of smallholder dairy farmers; limited milk collection and \\nprocessing facilities and low prices at collection points; lack of insurance c overage; absence of market \\ninformation; lack of appropriate breeds and knowledge gaps of farmers; lack of quality control facilities for \\nmedicine, vaccines and biological products, feed and feed ingredients, chicks, eggs and birds; and absence \\nof an effect ive regulatory body; etc. In addition, most meat production is handled (including slaughtering \\nof animals) under unsatisfactory sanitary conditions in both rural and urban areas.  \\nFood safety, Nutrition and Human health hazards:   \\n4.4.3  Objectives, Targets and Strategies for Livestock Sub -sector  \\nThe objective of the 8FYP plan is to meet the increasing demand of animal protein by sustainably enhancing \\nproduction, productivity and value addition of milk, meat and egg. The specific objectives:  \\n\\uf0a7 To promote sustai nable production of milk, meat and egg including processing products  \\n\\uf0a7 To ensure a nutritional -sensitive production system and consumption to tackle malnutrition \\namong poor and vulnerable population groups, including the children and women  \\n\\uf0a7 To promote sustai ned income generation and employment opportunities for the landless, \\nsmall and marginal farmers    \\n \\n310 \\n \\uf0a7 To generate need -based technology and improve livelihood of livestock farmers through \\nadaptive research  and to transfer developed technologies to users through training of \\nextension workers, planners, livestock farmers and other stakeholders  \\n\\uf0a7 To develop climate resilient and low -cost feeds and fodders production  \\n\\uf0a7 To facilitate entrepreneurship and increased participation of the private sector in the \\nproduction, mar keting and export of livestock products and by -products  on a commercial \\nbasis . \\nTargets:  The 8FYP plan sets a target to expand the production of milk from 9.92 million metric ton in \\n2018 -19 to 16.37 million metric ton in 2024-25; meat production from 7.5 mi llion MT to 8.51 million MT \\nand egg production from 17,109.7 million to about 22,400 million pieces (Table 4.8). These targets will be \\nachieved through enhancing productivity by using modern biological techniques, adopting appropriate \\ndisease diagnosis and  treatment, and by addressing climate smart livestock interventions for safeguarding \\nnutritional food security.  \\nTable 4.8: The Projected Demand and Supply of Milk, Meat and Eggs  \\nItems  2020 -21 2024-25 \\n Demand  Production Target  Demand  Production Target  \\nMilk  \\n(million MT)  15.84  \\n(250ml/person/day)  15.84  \\n(250ml/person/day)  16.36  \\n(250ml/person/day)  16.36  \\n(250ml/person/day)  \\nMeat  \\n(million MT)  7.61  \\n(120gm/person/daily)  7.93 \\n(125gm/person/daily)  7.85 \\n(120gm/person/daily)  8.51 \\n(130gm/person/daily)  \\nEgg \\n(million piece)  18055  \\n(104/Year /Person)  18576  \\n(107/Year /Person)  19407  \\n(104/Year /Person)  22393  \\n(120/Year /Person)  \\nSource: Department of Livestock Services (DLS ) projections.  \\nStrategies  \\nThe following strategies will be implemented to achieve the objectives of t he livestock sector:   \\nEnhancing productivity through research and development: Productivity will be enhanced through \\nextensive research and development activities. Research capacities of BLRI and other universities/institutes \\nundertaking the relevant rese arch activities will be enhanced to address the national priority and harness \\nthe untapped potential of regional livestock resources, and to ensure safe production of animal products and \\nby-products, animal protein supplement, feed additives, premixes, pro biotics and mineral and vitamin \\nsupplements as inputs for poultry and livestock development. Initiatives will be taken to encourage and \\nsupport private agencies and NGOs to undertake livestock research.  \\nDeveloping good quality breed: Bangladesh has one of  the highest livestock densities in the world, where \\nthe growth in population largely comes from commercial poultry and small ruminants. But the productivity \\nof local breeds is very low. Breed development through crossbreeding local variety with suitable e xotic \\nvariety should be of upmost priority. For backyard farming, where investment potential is limited, local \\nbreeds that have relatively higher productivity and hardy in nature will be promoted.   Besides, Artificial \\nInsemination (AI) programmes need stre ngthening in promoting quality breeds of livestock. Along with   \\n \\n311 \\n these, the original variety breed those are high -yielding needs to be conserved and promoted. For instance, \\nthe Black Bengal goat  (Bangla goat) is known for its relatively low demand for feed, high reproduction \\nrate, and disease resistance and is thus a traditional choice of asset for many poor and vulnerable \\nhouseholds.  \\nVeterinary services and animal health:  (4) Policy support will be provided to accelerate the development \\nof private and commun ity-based veterinary services, including compliant private veterinary diagnostic \\ncentres, clinics and hospitals. (3) An autonomous quality control agency would be established to ensure \\nquality of veterinary drugs, vaccines, feeds, feed ingredients and bree ding tools and materials. (2) A massive \\nprogramme on disease prevention and control of cattle and poultry diseases, awareness building and mass \\nprogramme for de -worming of animals against parasitic diseases will be designed. (1) Measures will be \\ntaken to e xtend veterinary services up to union level with adequate service provider and infrastructural \\nfacilities.  \\nPromoting poultry and livestock farming:  While there are several government initiatives for providing \\nmultiple incentives for the farmers in crop pr oduction, there is ample room for strengthening policy support \\nmechanisms for poultry and livestock production. Considering the need for protein and diet variety on the \\none hand and creating employment opportunities on the other, policy incentives for the livestock and \\npoultry subsectors can have important and far reaching development implications. To meet the huge target \\nof milk, meat and egg production by 2025, many small growers will need to have improved access to \\nfinance. Short -to-medium term collatera l-free loan facilities at subsidized interest rates, amongst others, \\nshould be introduced for poultry and livestock farmers. Besides, policy options for vaccine coverage for \\npoultry birds and ensuring quality feed supplies should be looked into.  \\nSupporting  small and medium farmers:  Immediate actions will be taken to address the constraints of \\nsmallholders in livestock rearing. Support to small and medium size livestock and poultry unit will be \\nemphasized along with large business enterprises. Private initia tives will be encouraged and supported for \\nproducing inputs like feed, medicines, vaccines and biological products, genetic stocks and materials for \\nthe small and medium size enterprises. All possible support should be extended to them also for processing \\nand exporting livestock products. Smallholder poultry and dairy producers and entrepreneurs will be \\nfacilitated through allowing access to bank financing at an affordable rate of interest with low or no \\ncollateral.   \\nImproving management practice: Better m anagement practices such as q uality assurance of feed stuff \\nincluding water, disease and pest control, hygienic processing of products and environmentally safe \\ndisposal of wastes are important strategies. These also have implications for food safety. The D LS has a \\nrole in developing human capital through training on appropriate feed mixture, vaccination and adherence \\nto bio -security guidelines. The supply of quality day -old chicks is important for small -scale commercial \\npoultry farms. The strategy should be  to address the main determinants of production, namely ensuring that \\nanimals are disease -free and well -fed with cost effective and balanced forms of animal feed. Introduction \\nof insurance schemes, at least for large commercial farms, will also be an impor tant consideration. \\nVeterinary and extension services are critical for livestock farming, although the DLS offices do not exist \\nbeyond the upazila level. The lead farmer approach will be continued with more training and incentives for \\nthe farmers.    \\n \\n312 \\n 4.5 FISHERI ES SUB -SECTOR  \\nBangladesh is one of the world\\'s leading fish producing countries with a t otal production of 42.77 lac MT,  \\nwhere aquaculture production contributes more than 56 per cent of total production. The fisheries sector \\ncontributes 3.50 per cent to t he national GDP and 25.71 per cent to the agricultural GDP (BER, 2019). During \\nthe past decade, the sector expanded at an average annual rate of 5.26 per cent. More than 10 per cent of the \\npopulation are directly or indirectly engaged in various fisheries activities for their livelihood. Bangladesh \\nachieved self -sufficiency in fish production with a per capita fish consumption of 62.58 g/da  \\n4.5.1 Performance of Fisheries Sub -Sector under  7FYP  \\nBangladesh ranks 3rd in producing fish from inland water bodies , 5th in aquaculture production and 11th in \\nmarine fish production. Since 1990, fish production has increased by more than five times. The 7FYP Plan \\nobjectives for fisheries were to enhance productivity, livelihoods security and equitable distribution of \\nbenefits while conserving the potential fisheries resources and aquatic biodiversity. During the Plan period, \\nthe fisheries subsector grew annually at 6.23 per cent  – slightly higher than the 6FYP plan average yearly \\ngrowth rate of 6.18 per cent. The fisherie s sector the largest growing subsector of agriculture. In 2017 -18, \\nthe total fish production was 4.28 million MT and the yearly volume growth rate was 5.94 per cent (Figure \\n4.7). The two major contributing factors behind the performance of fisheries sector  are: (i) pond aquaculture \\nusing hatchery produced fingerlings and (ii) conversion of fishponds by raising embankments around low -\\nlying land.  Inland production is historically the major supply source of fisheries products in Bangladesh. \\nThe average growth of inland fisheries was 6.7 per cent against 3.25 per cent for marine fisheries.  \\nFigure 4.7: Trend in Inland and Marine Fisheries Production  \\n \\nSource: FSYB, various issues  \\nOver the years, producti vity of fish produced in pond , oxbow -lakes, shrimp/prawn far ms and depressions  \\nhas increased substantially while the same productivity for other water bodies stagnated. Fish productivity \\nis highest in pond (4851 kg/ha), followed by oxbow -lakes  (1471 kg/ha) and shrimp/prawn farms (983 kg/ha) \\n(Figure 4.8).  \\n 0.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.004.50\\n1990\\n1991\\n1992\\n1993\\n1994\\n1995\\n1996\\n1997\\n1998\\n1999\\n2000\\n2001\\n2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018Million TonnesInland production Marine Production  \\n \\n313 \\n Figure 4. 8: Fish Productivity across  Different Types of Water Bodies  \\n \\nSource: 8PYP Agriculture sector background paper.  \\nHilsa contributes to around 12 per cent of country’s total fish production – the highest as a single species. Its \\ncontribution to the GDP is mo re than 1 per cent. In 2017 -18, a total of 5.17 lac metric tons H ilsa were caught, \\nup from 2.99 lac metric tons in 2008 -09. The fishing ban during reproductive periods has contributed to this \\ngrowth. The enlisted fishers receive allowances and other trade materials under the Alternative Income \\nGeneration (AIG) scheme during the banned periods. Apart from this, the increasing public awareness to stop \\njatka fishing contributed to this high growt h. It is worth mentioning that H ilsa got recognition of geographi cal \\nindication (GI) product of Bangladesh in 2017 .  \\nShrimp is one of the most important exportable merchandise in Bangladesh. Shrimp production increased to \\n2.54 Lack MT in 2017 -18 from less than one lac MT in 2001 -02. Several government initiatives includ ing zoning \\nof shrimp areas, official ban of wild shrimp fry from nature, shrimp farming infrastructure development, quality \\ncertification system and farmer training programmes contributed to this growth. Currently, s hrimp zoning \\nactivity is running through  survey of coastal area by a national committee. To increase galda and bagda \\nshrimp culture, 46 golda shrimp hatchery and 49 prawn hatcheries have been established under both public \\nand private ownership. The increase in fish production has been contribute d to export earnings. In 2018 -19 \\nBangladesh earned BDT 4,250.31 crore by exporting 73,171.32 metric tons fish and fishery products. Of \\nthis, BDT 3,088.85 crore (USD 365.54 million) was due to exports of frozen shrimp. Several initiatives, \\nincluding trainin g of farmers on Good Aquaculture Practice (GAP), implementation of National Residue \\nControl Plan (NRCP), modernization of fish quality control laboratories, etc. attributed to the export \\nsuccess.  \\n \\n \\n \\n 010002000300040005000\\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Kg/HaRiver and Estuary Beel Kaptai Lake\\nFloodplain Pond Baor\\nShrimp/Prawn Farm  \\n \\n314 \\n Table 4.9: Exports of Fish and Fisheries Products  \\nFinan cial year  Amount (MT)  Earnings (Crore Taka)  \\n2009 -10 77643.29  3408.51  \\n2010 -11 96469.23  4603.67  \\n2011 -12 92479.18  4703.95  \\n2012 -13 84904.5  3412.61  \\n2013 -14 77328.86  4898.22  \\n2014 -15 83524.37  4662.6  \\n2015 -16 75337.93  4282.82  \\n2016 -17 68305.68  4287.64  \\n2017 -18 68935.45  4309.94  \\n2018 -19 73171.32  4250.31  \\nSource: Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) of Bangladesh.  \\n4.5.2  Challenges of Fisheries Sub -sector  \\nAlthough the fisheries sub -sector performed quite well during the 7FYP plan period, the sector is \\nconfronting with several challenges that can constrain the sectors’ growth in the future. Some of these are \\ndiscussed below:  \\nSupply chain disruptions due to COVID-19: The outbreak of COVID -19 may have some implications \\nfor the fisheries sub -sector in the short to medium r un. For wild -capture fisheries, the inability of fishing \\nvessels to operate (due to limited demand as well as social distancing measures being difficult to abide by \\non board a vessel) can generate a domino effect throughout the value chains in terms of sup ply of products. \\nHowever, the consequence of the COVID -19 induced disruption  in the fisheries supply chain is likely to be \\nnot clear at this stage.  \\nDegradation of natural resources:  Inland fishery including seasonal flood -land w hich includes \\nfloodplains, depressions (beels)  and rivers is the main hub of fish production in Bangladesh. The inland \\nopen water fishery is threatened by gradual depletion and degradation of natural resources, owing to rapid \\nurbanization, and infrastructure investments etc., which negatively impacted fisheries. If the inland open \\nwater resources cannot be reversed by effective conservation measures, the fish production will be \\nthreatened further.  \\nInland capture fisheries: Conservation and sustainable management:  The inland capture fisheries is \\ncontinuously shrinking mainly because of over -fishing, use of destructive gears, silting up of water bodies, \\nclosure of natural fish passes, non -fishers’ control of the ‘jolmohal ’ by malpractices in lease and by \\nencroachment; and pollution of water bodies by agro -chemicals, industrial wastes and urban sewers etc. \\nConsequen tly, inland fisheries, which were  a main source of livelihoods of poor fishers and a source of free \\nprotein supply for many rural households, have been declining. Proper polic ies, regulations and \\nmanagement of inland water resources can help reverse the declining trend.  \\nInland aquaculture:  The inland aquaculture experienced fastest growth mainly through the introduction \\nof new technologies, species and intensification and impr ovement of farming particularly in pond \\naquaculture. However, the sector is undergoing multiple challenges including, among others, poor brood   \\n \\n315 \\n stock management, inadequacy of the supply of fish and shrimp spawn and fries of desired quality and from \\nreliabl e source at reasonable price, low availability of reliable and quality fish feed at a reasonable cost, \\nspread of infectious diseases of both fish and shrimp, lack of institutional capacity to assist with the needed \\nextension services, etc. Flood plain aqua culture is at risk because of increasing waterlogging, blocking \\nmigratory routes of indigenous fish species, disturbing biodiversity and creating social conflicts.  \\nMarine fisheries:  The marine fisheries are  an important source of protein, contributing abou t 15 per cent \\nof the total fisheries production in 2018 -19. Although growing in terms of absolute production, the rate of \\nexpansion has been very slow. As a result, marine fisheries are  experiencing a decline in its share in total \\nfish production – shrinki ng from almost 18 per cent in 2009 -10. Key challenges include, overcapacity of \\nfishing effort, infringement of rules and regulations, entry of illegal fishing vessels and pouching in the \\nBangladesh EEZ, long gap exploratory survey on stocks assessment, int ense and overfishing deploying \\ndestructive and illegal  gears, shift in the climate change paradigm, illegal, unreported and unregulated \\n(IUU) fishing, destructive fishing, pollution, catching of juveniles, degradation of highly productive coastal \\nand near -shore marine habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, estuaries, spawning and nursing grounds \\nseriously impacts our marine fisheries productivity disrupting ecosystem function etc.  \\nShrimp and brackish water aquaculture:  Aquaculture specifically shrimp and prawn production, which \\nis also an export earner, involves manufacture of numerous inputs such as feed, fertilizers, pesticides and \\nveterinary drugs, as well as of technical devices for water treatment and pond operation. The off -farm post -\\nharvest producti on links also include processors and marketing agents (packaging, transport, export -\\nimporters, consumers, quality control). While shrimp and brackish water aquaculture have been growing \\nover the last three decades but productivity remains low. While the pr ocessors and hatcheries have created \\nexcess capacity, shrimp production could not reach the desired and potential level. One reason is that the \\nshrimp farms, particularly the brackish water bagda farms, use very traditional and extensive method, hence \\nyield remains very low. Golda farming is facing scarcity of feed while bagda farming is facing scarcity of \\ngood quality and virus -free shrimp fry called post larvae (PL). In past years there were problems with \\nshrimp cultivation and processing, such as, qualit y assurance and traceability and inadequacy in social \\ncompliance, which affected export.  \\nWhile shrimp and brackish water aquaculture expanded significantly, there are several threats. The \\nproblems with shrimp cultivation and processing in the past years, such as , quality assurance,  traceability \\nand inad equacy in social compliance  affected exports. The quality assurance system with regards t o fish \\nand fishery products has  been improved remarkably during the 6th and 7th plan periods. Laboratory facilities \\nfor microbiological, residual and chemical testing have also been raised  up to the European standards and \\nsustained successfully. Traceability along with other bio -security issues shall be further improved and \\nlaboratory facilities needs to be further expand ed during the 8th plan.  \\nOther major challenges:  Among other major challenges in the fishing industry, product quality control \\nmeasures were limited to exporting. It is difficult to adequately comply with HACCP standards and there \\nis a need for building cap acity and enforcing standards -related requirements. Other challenges include \\nscarcity of quality fish fry and fingerlings; inadequate infrastructure for processing, transportation and \\nmarketing of fish and fish products; i nadequate post -harvest management system; a dverse impacts of \\nclimate change; inadequate human resources and logistic support and knowledge gap of the producers; and \\nlimited facilities for research and development for production up gradation .   \\n \\n316 \\n 4.5.3  Strategies for Fisheries Sub -sector  \\nObject ives: The major objective of the fisheries sub -sector in the 8FYP is to support sustainable growth in fish \\nand shrimp production with other aquatic resources for domestic consumption and exports by managing open -\\nwater fisheries resources, exploring blue ec onomy through community participation leading to equitable \\ndistribution of the benefits for optimal economic and social growth, and reducing post -harvest loss. The strategic \\nobjectives for the sub sector are to:  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance fisheries resources and production.  \\n\\uf0b7 Alleviate poverty through creating self -employment and improvement of socio -economic conditions \\nof the fishers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Achieve economic growth and earn foreign currency by exporting fish and fisheries products.  \\n\\uf0b7 Manage resources including manpower development for ensuring optimum productivity, \\nsustainability of production and conservation of fisheries resources.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish and maintain fish and wetland sanctuaries which include ban on fishing in certain eco -\\nsensitive areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Harness the potential of blue economy, sto ck assessment of marine fisheries and promote sustainable \\nexploitation of marine fishes, especially tuna and tuna like other pelagic fishing.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote value chain in fish and fisheries products.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure safe and quality fish supplies in the domestic and inte rnational market.  \\nTarget s: The strategic objectives in the 8FYP plan for the fisheries sector will be achieved by increasing \\nfish production targets as set out in Table 4.10. The Plan targets to increase the participation of women in \\naquaculture production , fisheries, CBOs/Co -management and fish/ shrimp processing industries by 30 per \\ncent. Good Aquaculture Practice (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) will be promoted at all \\nstages of fish/shrimp supply chain to comply international standard.  \\nTable 4.10: Projected Production of Fish in the 8th plan \\nSL \\nNO.

On this ground, the 8FYP will focus on sustainability (environmentally, socially \\nand economically compatible) and q uality (improved traceability for compliance) of the fish production \\nand management system. A proper safeguarding mechanism for the landless and marginal farmers will be \\ndeveloped against any type of natural and non -natural shocks . \\nSupply of quality finger lings and fish feeds through private sector will remain an important strategy for \\nculture fisheries. Promoting small indigenous species in conjunction with pond carp culture will be given \\nimportance.  The Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) will  work on new varieties and \\ntechnological development and provide technical support to the department of fisheries (DoF), which will \\nbe responsible for dissemination at the field level. DoF will also work extensively on developing capacity \\nof the farmers th rough skill development programmes .    \\nAquaculture development: The following priority strategies have been identified for aquaculture \\ndevelopment:  \\n\\uf0b7 Aquaculture intensification and species diversification will be promoted , avoiding water \\npollution ; \\n\\uf0b7 Farm me chanization and vertical expansion of aquaculture will be the major priority for \\nsustaining and diversifying  of aquaculture production;  \\n\\uf0b7 Fish health management strategy and aquaculture policy will be adopted and implemented for \\nsustaining deve lopment of the  fisheries sector;  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of adaptive aquaculture technologies and fisheries management system for the \\npoor fish farmers/fishers of coastal region through training and farm demonstration;  \\n\\uf0b7 Operation of hatcheries, nurseries and supply of spawn and fry , in which the private sector is \\nthe key player, will be constantly monitored by GO -NGO collaboration and pu blic-private \\npartnerships;  \\n\\uf0b7 Production, import and marketing of fish and shrimp feed, feed ingredients, minerals and \\nvitamin premix, and other inpu ts will be monitored constantly;  \\n\\uf0b7 Cage culture in the flood plains, with private ownership will be encouraged which can certa inly \\ncontribute to productivity;  \\n\\uf0b7 Aquaculture and conservation will be restructured to reinforce the strengths of each other, \\nsustainab le and community -based flood plain aquaculture will be combined with maintaining \\nsanctuaries and restocking of indigenous species ;   \\n \\n318 \\n \\uf0b7 Natural breeding, spawning, nursery and grow -out areas will be conserved to complete the \\nwhole lifecycle and natural reproduc tion process to en sure pure brood and fingerlings;  \\n\\uf0b7 Transportation and rearing in the hatcheries will be facilitated. To ensure supply of virus -free \\nshrimp PL, all hatcheries will ensure PCR testing of both mother shrimps and shrimp PL ; \\n\\uf0b7 Community organizati ons of shrimp farmers and other primary stakeholders will be supported \\nwith technology, input, financing and market linkage by contract growing system run by the \\nprocessing plants and monitored by the DOF and partner NGOs ; \\n\\uf0b7 Development of tractability syste m to identify the sources of contaminants/banned antibiotics \\nand other chemicals used for fish farming and fish processing times so as to take lawful and \\ncorrective measures to improve/ratify them . DoF should meticulously look into this;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing fish pr oduction by introducing different fish culture methods under the community \\nenterprise approach in suitable habitats by conserving natural environment including rice -cum-\\n/alternate fish culture;  \\n\\uf0b7 Extension support and research extensio n linkages will be stre ngthened;  \\n\\uf0b7 Biofloc system of fish production for landless and marginal farm ers and also in the urban areas;  \\n\\uf0b7 Market driven community based innovative flood plain polyculture system of ‘Daudkandi \\nModel’ may be expanded in flood plain areas throughout the coun try. \\nOpen water capture fisheries: Open water capture fisheries are  an important source of livelihood and \\nprotein for rural households. Productivity  under open water capture fisheries has been mostly stagnant for \\nseveral reasons including, among others, de pletion of stock, shrinking of water bodies, and water quality \\ndeterioration. Involving local communities are critical in addressing issues like pollution and replenishment \\nof stocks. Inland open water resources will be conserved in a sustainable way and a n emphasis is given to \\nimprove productivity during the 8FYP. The following strategies will be implemented:   \\n\\uf0b7 Inland unused water resources will be conserved and developed for fish production. Pollution \\ncontrol of river and lakes will be a major focus for go vernment agencies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Prevent further deterioration of water logging, blockade of water -flows and shrinkage of water -\\nbodies because of unplanned infrastructures like embankments, roads, urban housing projects and \\nindustrialization. Any development projects m ust follow the environmental rules and regulations \\n(and incorporate adequate mitigation measures in consultation with the Ministry of Fisheries and \\nLivestock). Projects and programmes will be implemented to construct and maintain fish -passes \\nand fish -frien dly regulators.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fish and wetland sanctuaries which will be established with complete ban on fishing in certain eco -\\nsensitive areas like the Sundarbans, parts of Kaptai Lake, and several sections of the river Halda, \\nselected beels and haor areas and certai n sections of the Bay of Bengal, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fish conservation strategy will be developed and implemented. The strategy will include seasonal \\nbans, gear restrictions, identifying genuine fishers by issuing ID cards, species restrictions, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 For sustainable H ilsa fish production, Maximum Sustainable Yield  (MSY) will be determined. \\nStrong monitoring, Community -based Management Approach  and other precautionary measures \\nwill be applied to av oid overfishing. Management of H ilsa sanctuary will be strengthened.  \\nMeasu res will also be taken to improve H ilsa marketing system and its value chain.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Fish Act 1950 will be strictly implemented, and, if needed, the act will be revised.    \\n \\n319 \\n \\uf0b7 Fishermen will have access to social safety sets like VGD and VGF and alternative livelih oods \\nsupport during the restriction periods of fish catching.  \\n\\uf0b7 Proper insurance schemes for the fish farmers will be made available. Private insurance should be \\nencouraged to come forward.  \\n\\uf0b7 The fishermen will be organized in sustainable community -based organ izations and such \\norganizations will be given management responsibility of khas ‘jolmohal ’ on long term basis so \\nthat they conserve rather than just exploit resources.  \\n \\nMarine fisheries: Marine fisheries are  an important component of the blue economy. Collaborative efforts \\nwill be undertaken to explore blue economy -related activities concerning the fisheries sector. The fishermen \\nin Bangladesh hardly have capabilities of catching demersal fishes below 50 metres depth of water. \\nLongline fishing is totally ab sent in deep waters. The capacity development of fishermen in deep sea will \\nbe a major focus of the 8FYP.  \\nHarvesting of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) of marine fishes is seen as a major element to sustain \\nfood security. It is true that marine fishes are  not popular in Bangladesh. A national programme needs to \\nbe undertaken to popularize marine fish as part of the normal diet. The strategies for marine fisheries in the \\n8FYP plan are aligned with the perspective plan 2041 and the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 . The following \\nstrategies will be undertaken:  \\n\\uf0b7 Restrict and control pouching of resources and illegal entry of foreign trawlers  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduc e Vessel Tracking and Monitoring System (VTMS)  \\n\\uf0b7 Identify conservation needs and methods that can be effectively administ ered and regularly \\nmonitored  \\n\\uf0b7 Cooperate with the Coast Guard and Navy on the control of encroachment and breach of regulation, \\nalso by local vessels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Institutional capacity building of the concerned agencies, strengthening of monitoring, control and \\nsurveil lance system (MCS) in the Bay of Bengal.  \\n\\uf0b7 Stock and maximum sustainable yield/total allowable catch (quota) must be determined thorough \\nassessments on a regular basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Digital Marine Fisheries Resource Mapping for the marine waters using digital cartography  of the \\nmarine fisheries resources is an essential tool for efficient and sustainable harvesting of the marine \\nresources. However, in all SAARC countries this is either absent or not in a state of art position. If \\na common DMFRM can be developed for SAARC countries that will be very  useful to all the \\ncountries that  at the same time will save the required investment in this respect.  \\n\\uf0b7 Collaborative effort for distant water fishing (beyond 200m of EEZ and ABNJ) to explore and \\nexploit tuna and large pelagic fish es. \\n\\uf0b7 Establish MPAs (marine protected areas) as breeding grounds.  \\n \\nOther strategies:  The other important strategies specific to fisheries sub -sector are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 Private sector investment will be promoted for fish and fisheries product value chain.  \\n\\uf0b7 Motiv ational activities for farmers/ entrepreneurs will be taken to adopt advanced farming \\ntechnologies.    \\n \\n320 \\n \\uf0b7 Application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) will be promoted to disseminate \\nfisheries information and modern technology in the remote area s of the country for facilitating \\nfisheries activities particularly the aquaculture  \\n\\uf0b7 Promulgation of new acts, laws, rules, regulations, aligned with attainments of SDG targets.  \\n\\uf0b7 New development projects and programmes will be undertaken aiming the specific SDG targets.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developed skilled/trained manpower to operate modern laboratory as well as processing plants.  \\n\\uf0b7 As the fisher men,  dependent on aquatic environment , are highly vulnerable to the effect of climate \\nchange, special importance/consideration will be g iven to their livelihoods.  \\n\\uf0b7 Regular and long -term study/research on change of biodiversity, impact of sanctuary, habitat \\nrestoration; physical, chemical & biological changes of haor basin, fish production, fish migration \\nand socio -economic condition of fish er folk will be implemented  \\n\\uf0b7 Collaboration and coordination among ministries, department and agencies should be strengthened.  \\nBesides, considering the huge demand for hygienic dry fish in the country and abroad, the Bangladesh \\nFisheries Development Corpora tion (BFDC) will take initiative to establish modern shutki  (dried fish)  \\nmohal in different strategic locations of the country to produce hygienic dry fish. The shipbuilding industry \\nin Bangladesh is getting a boost from the developments in the fisheries s ector. A lot of fishing trawlers, \\nbarges, tugs and vessels are badly needed in docking/undocking/building and repairing facilities. BFDC \\nhas already established dockyard at the Chittagong Fish Harbours  and Patharghata Fish Landing Centre. To \\nenhance the ex isting facilities, another two -channel slipway has recently been constructed at the Chittagong \\nFish Harbour. In order to expand the docking facilities for fishing boats, more dockyards will be established \\nat different strategic locations in coastal areas.  \\n4.6 WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  \\n4.6.1  Performance of Water Resource Management under 7FYP  \\nAgricultural practices in Bangladesh are largely determined by the hydrological cycle. Farmers need \\nprotection against flooding in wet seasons, irrigation in dry seasons, supplementary irrigation even in wet \\nseasons, protection against saline water intrusion in coastal areas, proper drainage both in wet and dry \\nseasons, protection against river erosion, and safeguard measures against the water -related hazards (storm \\nsurge/c yclone) in the coastal belt.  \\nBangladesh, being the lower most riparian country in the Ganges -Brahmaputra -Meghna basins and \\ncrisscrossed by around 700 rivers including 57 trans boundary  rivers, shares its trans boundary  water \\nresources with the upper ripar ian countries like Bhutan, China, India and Nepal. Out of a total catchment \\narea of 1.72 million square km of the Ganges -Brahmaputra -Meghna basins, only around 7 per cent basin \\narea falls within the Bangladesh territory. Out of the 57 Trans boundary  rivers  of Bangladesh, 13 rivers fall \\nunder the Ganges basin fully or partially in the four Hydrological Regions; 11 rivers fall under the \\nBrahmaputra basin lying fully or partially over the seven hydrological regions and 25 rivers covering six \\nHydrological Regio ns lying fully or partially in the Meghna Basin. The annual cross -border river flows \\nentering the river systems are estimated to be 1,200 billion cubic meter s (BCM), of which the three main \\nrivers contribute some 981 BCM (i.e. almost 78 per cent of the tot al cross border flow), 85 per cent of which \\nenters the country between June and October. Out of 981 BCM, some 54 per cent is contributed by the \\nBrahmaputra, 31 per cent by the Ganges, nearly 14 per cent by the tributaries of the (upper) Meghna and 1   \\n \\n321 \\n per ce nt is contributed by other minor rivers of the Eastern Hills. Only 15 per cent of the total trans boundary  \\nflow i.e. 148 BCM is available during the dry season where only 1 per cent (11 BCM) of the total flow \\n(Ahmed and Roy,2004) is received in the critica l month of February, thus showing the vulnerability of the \\ntrans boundary  flow to meet the water demand during the dry season.  \\nEfforts to implement integrated water management con tinued in the 7FYP with focus on flood control \\nprevention of river bank erosi on, and supply of irrigation water, River dredging to improve river \\nnavigability also continued.  However, the adverse effects of climate change ha ve continued to take a toll \\non the loss of income and livelihoods in the rural areas through regular episodes  of flooding, river bank \\nerosion, salinity, water logging and droughts.  The government recognized that business as usual approach \\nto water management would not do.  So, given the importance of water for the Bangladesh economy and \\nits strong links to natur al hazards based on its interface  with environment and climate change, Bangladesh \\ndid a comprehensive long -term study on water management integrated with land use, agriculture, \\nenvironmental management and preservation of bio -diversity with a view to estab lishing best practice water \\nmanagement that minimizes the risks of natural hazards while protecting fa rm incomes and livelihood.  This \\nstudy known as the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) was approved by the NEC in November 2018 \\nfor speedy implementatio n.  BDP 2100 was a key input to the formulation of water management strategies \\nin the PP2041 and the 8FYP will be the first step to implement BDP2100.  \\nIt is important to note that the BDP2100 involves water management in all its dimensions including flood  \\ncontrol, sea -level rise, salinity, water logging, river bank erosion, irrigation, urban and rural water supply, \\nwater pollution, land reclamation, river dredging for inland water traffic, , environment protection, forestry, \\nfisheries, and preservation of bio-diversity.  Given this comprehensive approach to water management, the \\nimplementation of BDP2100 involves multiple sectors and multiple ministries.  This section deals \\nexclusively with water issues as related to agriculture including livestock and fish eries. Inland water \\ntransport issues are discussed in Chapter 6.  Forestry and environmental management issues are discussed \\nin Chapter 8. Urban sector water issues a re discussed in Chapter 11; while disaster management issues are \\ndiscussed in Chapter 14.     \\nThe Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is engaged in the development and management of \\nthe water resources of the country. Since its establishment, sixty years back, it has made a total of 6.5 \\nmillion hectare of agricultural land free from flood  and drainage congestion. It has created the necessary \\ninfrastructure of providing irrigation facilities to an area of 1.624 million hectares. It constructed 16,262 \\nkm of embankment of which 5,757 km are in the coastal area. It has been able to reclaim abo ut 10,370 sq. \\nkm of land in the Meghna estuary through construction of cross dams. Its water management activities \\ncover about 40 per cent of the country and 50 per cent of the total flood plain area. Moreover, BWDB has \\ncompleted 96 projects under the Bang ladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) of the Ministry of \\nEnvironment and Forestry and Climate Change.  \\nThe three main Ministries involved with water management as related to agriculture are the Ministry of \\nWater Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and th e Local Government Division dealing with Rural \\nDevelopment and Cooperatives. The large flood control and irrigation project and river management issues \\nare dealt with by the Ministry of Water Resources .  The MoLGRD&C and MoA deals with minor irrigation \\nand flood control schemes.  Bangladesh Water Development Board, BADC, BMDA,  LGED, DPHE, City \\nCorporations  are responsible for implementing water projects of the concerned Ministries. The Water   \\n \\n322 \\n Resource Planning Organization (WARPO) is an executive institution  accountable for water resource \\nplanning an d management in Bangladesh. Water Act 2013 has been enacted by the government, which \\nprovides the legal framework for water management. The Act is designed for integrated development, \\nmanagement, extraction, distr ibution, usage, protection and conservation of water resources in Bangladesh. \\nThis is a comprehensive Act and covers well all aspects of water management as an integrated resource. \\nThe Water Act 2013 currently op erates through the use of a number of operat ing principles defined by the \\nNational Water Policy of 1999 and the National Water Resource Management document of 2001. The \\nIntegrated Minor Irrigation Policy 2017 and the Uses of Groundwater Management Act 2018 in Agriculture \\nare also helpful interventio ns. The  government approved the Bangladesh Water Rules 2018 which will \\ncontribute significantly toward improving Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and achieving \\nthe Sustainable Development Goal s (SDG). The Groundwater Management in Agricultural Activities Bill \\n2018 will ensure the best possible use of water and its management for continuing the trend of development \\nin the agriculture sector.  \\nThe National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) established in 2014 under the National River \\nConservatio n Commission Act 2013, is responsible for the prevention of illegal grabbing of river land, and \\nconserving the river water and environment from pollution with all kind of waste, ensuring the \\nmultidimensional use of river system for inclusive development, a nd restoring natural flows of the river \\nwith proper maintenance and all season navigability. The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority \\n(BIWTA) is another organization engaged in river conservation and developing, maintaining and operating \\ninland rive r ports.   \\nThe Honourable  Prime Minister of Bangladesh was a member of the UN and the World Bank High Level \\nPanel for Water, which prioritized Valuing Water (derived from the Total Economic Value of water along \\n3 dimensions) as the foremost action to achie ving sustainable water resource management. The SDG Cell \\nin the Prime Minister’s Office took up the task of identifying and executing Valuing Water related projects \\ndue to its role in the inter -ministerial coordination and the strong linkages between Valui ng Water and \\nachieving the SDGs.  In cooperation with the Ministry of Water Resources, the High -Level Valuing Water \\nCommittee and the Technical Valuing Water Committee developed a Proforma for Study Proposal (PFS) \\non a study to Develop Operational Shadow Pr ices for Water to Support Informed Policy and Investment \\nDecision Making Processes. It was approved by the Ministry of Water Resources and is now being \\nimplemented by WARPO. Jointly with the Ministry of Water Resources, the High -Level Valuing Water \\nCommitt ee and Technical Valuing Water Committee are in the process to publish a Position Paper on \\nValuing Water in Bangladesh.  \\n4.6.2  Challenges of Water Resource Management   \\nThere are several challenges affecting development and management of water bodies and th eir proper \\nutilisation . The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 discusses existing and forward -looking challenges pertinent to \\nwater sector management, some of which are summarized below.  \\nFlood risk:  Bangladesh is one of the most flood prone countries in the worl d. Different hotspots and \\nhydrological regions of the country face different types of floods at different times of the year. North -west, \\nNorth -central and South -west regions are more susceptible to river flooding whereas North -east and \\nEastern -Hilly region  as well as North -west and North -central regions are vulnerable to flash floods (during   \\n \\n323 \\n April -May and September -November). Rainfed flooding and water logging occur in many parts of the \\ncountry but are mainly prevalent in the South Western part of the count ry. Coastal flood mostly occurs \\nalong the coastal zone of Bangladesh. Every year, floods cause extensive damages of agricultural crops, \\nendangering many livestock and leaving a huge economic loss for the country especially for the rural poor \\nhouseholds. Af ter flood, food crises cause hunger for many poor households.   \\nAvaila bility of water in the dry seas on: Water availabili ty especially in the dry season  and water quality \\nare key issues for the agriculture sector. Agriculture sector is under pressure both because of increasing \\ndemands for food, and depletion of agricultural land and water resources. Besides, the impacts of climate \\nchange on food production are national as well as global concerns. In Bangladesh, several natural calamities \\noccur throughout th e years. Droughts primarily occur in pre -monsoon and post -monsoon seasons, but in \\nsome extreme cases the pre -monsoon droughts have extended in monsoon season due to delayed onset of \\nthe monsoon rains. The Southwest and Northwest Hydrology regions of the co untry are most vulnerable to \\ndroughts.  \\nEarly -season droughts are due to delayed onset or early breaks of monsoon rainfall. This is particularly \\nrelevant in the Barind. The onset of the pre -monsoon season, upon which farmers decide to sta rt ‘Aus’ rice \\ncultivation  varies  widely from year to year. A break in the pre -monsoon season may therefore lead to crop \\nloss or complete crop failure. Mid -season droughts are caused by intermittent, short or extended dry spells. \\nEnd of season droughts are caused by early wit hdrawal of monsoon rainfall, affecting the ‘Aman’ rice crop. \\nHigh Yielding Varieties are particularly sensitive to these droughts. Droughts cause huge loss of crops \\nevery year. Several irrigation systems have been developed throughout the country to ensure  irrigation \\nduring dry season and drought. Still the availably of water in the dry season and high cost of irrigation are \\nconsidered as major challenges for agricultural production.  \\nRiver water management: Most of the water related challenges are related t o the mighty rivers. Reduction \\nof dry season flows due to increasing upstream withdrawal is causing severe water shortage across the \\ncountry. Only 15 per cent of the total trans -boundary  flow i.e. 148 billion cubic meters  (BCM) is available \\nduring the dry season where  only 1 per cent (11 BCM) of the total flow is received in the critical month of \\nFebruary. Reduced stream flow is also accelerating salinity intrusion and environmental degradation. \\nRestoration of major rivers and their off takes  as well as enh anced regional cooperation in the Ganges -\\nBrahmaputra -Meghna basins will ensure availability of more flow in dry season. Increased dry season flow \\nwill positively affect the entire country. However, these strategies will in particular help to mitigate the \\nnegative impacts such as droughts and water scarcity affecting the dry season irrigation initiatives, \\nexcessive extraction of groundwater and its depletion in North -central Hydrological region; salinity \\nintrusion of South -central and South -west region as we ll as enhance domestic water supply sources of the \\nNorth -west Hydrological region.  \\nCoastal zone protection and management: The coastal zone covers the South -west, South -central and \\nSouth -east areas of Bangladesh, which, is often subjected to inundation by  high tides, saline water intrusion, \\ncyclonic storms and associated tidal surges. In order to control flood and resist salinity intrusion towards \\nagricultural activities, polderisation began in the 1960s. But over time, the polders have been dilapidated \\ndue to erosion and lack of proper maintenance and it began to affect the coastal rivers’ drainage capacity \\nand siltation in the delta region. Moreover, the coastal zone, especially the flat and unprotected areas will   \\n \\n324 \\n severely be impacted due to cyclones and storm surge events and further climate change induced problems \\nlike sea level rise, heavy monsoon downpour, unavailability of fresh water and saltwater ingression. Due \\nto sea level rise, the salinity frontier of the country will move upstream gradually ove r the years. Several \\nareas in the coastal zone, especially Western part and Noakhali mainland suffer from extensive and \\npermanent waterlogging. The problem of water -logging is also severe in the coastal polders, particularly in \\nSatkhira, Jashore, Khulna, B agerhat and Noakhali Districts. Reasons behind waterlogging are complex and \\ndiffer between regions. Drainage capacity is a main concern. In some flood control embankments having \\ninadequate drainage facilities and road construction annual flooding is observ ed inside the flood protection \\nembankments.  \\nWetland conservation:  Wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance, flood management \\nand work as retention basins in the wet season. Wetlands contain very rich components of biodiversity of \\nlocal, national, and regional significance and it also supports millions of people’s livelihood. Wetlands, \\nwhich are locally called haors, baors (oxbow lake), and beels (depressions), are disappearing due to \\npopulation pressure, unplanned infrastructures tha t prevent wetlands from maintaining their ecological and \\nhydrological functions, etc. The total area of wetlands in Bangladesh is estimated to be 7 to 8 million ha, \\nor about 50 per cent of its total land surface. However, wetlands are reducing at an alarmi ng rate and it is \\nimportant to conserve and restore these wetlands.  \\nClimate change: The challenges of climate change and natural hazards have been discussed in the previous \\nsection of this chapter. Impacts of such climate change on the country’s water reso urces are assumed to \\naffect the most in the coastal zone. Availability of fresh water will decline and natural hazards like cyclone, \\nstorm surges and coastal flooding will increase. The salinity level of groundwater along with the surface \\nwater will rise r apidly due to the sea level rise as a direct impact of climate change. The local communities \\nand their livelihood would be greatly vulnerable due to climate change.  \\nPopulation growth: Domestic water demand is estimated to increase by up to 50 per cent by 2 030 and 100 \\nper cent by 2050 considering the population growth (BDP 2100). The population growth of Bangladesh \\nwill increasingly stress the water resources management of the country. Thus, it has the potential to be the \\ndominant environmental and possibly the most important development challenges in the coming days. \\nSignificant investments in water resource infrastructure will be required to provide potable water to the \\nexpanding urban centres. Urban and industrial pollution around these urban centres will affect the fresh \\nwater quality. With the growing population, sanitation will become a major issue both in the urban and \\nrural areas.  \\nUpstream development: The country’s water resources management will increasingly face challenges due \\nto upstream river basi n developments. Infrastructural developments in upstream countries particularly in \\nIndia have significantly reduced the dry season flow of the Trans boundary R ivers. The reduction of the \\nGanges flows has severely affected the fresh water supply to the comm unities, agriculture, navigation, \\nhydro -morphological dynamics, etc. in the South -western region of Bangladesh and especially on the \\necology of the Sundarbans.  \\n   \\n \\n325 \\n Institutional capacity and water resource management: Sustainability of water institutions is critical for \\nwater resources management. Resource mobilization for operation and maintenance activities and its \\nexecution are highly important. These crucial factors greatly depend on multidisciplinary participation, \\ncooperation and partnership of the wate r related institutions. The country has more than 35 central \\ngovernment organizations, affiliated with some 13 Ministries/ Divisions, which are working for water sector \\nplanning, development and management. The capacities of most of these organisations in terms of human \\nresources, technical knowledge, budget, etc. are inadequate to undertake their mandated tasks efficiently. \\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) work of most of the existing structural interventions are not duly \\nperformed because of shortage of re sources. Prevailing institutional arrangements are inadequate to respond \\nto the needs of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) implementation. There is limited \\nconsensus on the formulation and implementation of IWRM schemes in Bangladesh. Institutio nal and \\norganizational versatility is an absolute prerequisite for integration across different sectors and spatial \\nboundaries in considering interdependency of natural systems and social response to increasing demands.  \\n4.6.3  Strategies for Water Resource  Management in 8th Plan  \\nThe objectives and targets of the water sector for the 8th Plan have been set out in conformity with the \\nPP2041 and the BDP2100. The objective of the water sector in the 8th plan is to scale up existing good \\npractices of water conse rvation and management and apply more widely integrated water management, \\nincluding flood control and prevention schemes, flood early warning systems, irrigation improvement, and \\ndemand -side management as advocated in BDP2100. The strategic objectives incl ude:  \\n\\uf0b7 Continuing and strengthen river dredging to enhance navigability and to facilitate water \\ntransportation ; \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing water use efficiency in crop production and enhance the utilization of surface water \\nirrigation ; \\n\\uf0b7 Protecting riverbank from erosion thr ough integrated long -terms measures ; \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring conjunctive use of surface and ground water for sustainable irrigation, securing \\ngroundwater conservation ;  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening regional and international cooperation for basin -wide water resources development \\nand ma nagement of trans -boundary rivers ; \\n\\uf0b7 Preventing of saline intrusion through augmenting the freshwater flow in the southwest region \\nincluding the Sundarbans ; \\n\\uf0b7 Developing modern early warning systems to minimize economic losses from flood and other \\ndisasters ; \\n\\uf0b7 Adapting of climate change mitigation strategies ; \\n\\uf0b7 Rain water harvesting ;   \\n\\uf0b7 Implementing integrated coastal zone management strategies ; \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening capacities of the institution in the water resource management ;  \\n\\uf0b7 Mainstreaming Valuing Water into Public Inv estment Decision Making in collaboration with \\nPlanning Commission to allow for future investment decisions which further support sustainable \\nwater resources management  and thus sustainable economic development ; \\n\\uf0b7 Identifying and demonstrating options to inco rporate Valuing Water into private sector decision \\nmaking in order to lead to more sustainable investment and operational choices .   \\n \\n326 \\n Table 4.11: Eighth Five Year Plan Targets for the Water Sector  \\nIndicator  Targets (per year)  \\nBank protection work (KM)  2,356  \\nEmbankment construction/reconstruction (KM)  3,949  \\nCoastal embankment construction (KM)  1,043  \\nDredging of river (KM)  2,817  \\nExcavation/re -excavation drainage canal (KM)  17,042  \\nExcavation/re -excavation irrigation canal (KM)  1,119  \\nWater control structure /hydraulic structure (Nos.)  2,050  \\nCoastal cross -dam (Nos.)  7 \\nWMG/WMA/WMF formulation (Nos.)  363 \\nWMG/WMA/WMF registration (Nos.)  581 \\nLand acquisition ( Hectare ) 7159  \\nSource: Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR)  and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED).  \\nStrategies  \\nThe BDP2100 and the PP2041 provide detail strategies for the water resource management. The BDP2100 \\nwater sectors strategies are based on the several broad pillars: flood risk management strategy, fresh water \\nstrategy, and strategies fo r six hotspots – namely, Barind an d Drought Prone Areas, coastal z one, river \\nsystems and estuaries, urban area, haor and flash flood areas, Chattogram Hill Tracts.  Consistent with the \\nmedium to long term programmes set out in the PP2041 and the BDP2100, t he following strategies are \\nconsidered for the 8th plan period.   \\nUse of water resources and water economy: Water is a very essential input for increasing crop production \\nand sustainable agriculture. Due to climate change and lifting groundwater in an unpl anned way, a \\nsignificant portion of the country is not getting irrigation water during the dry season. Therefore, a well -\\nplanned irrigation management system is essential for a gradual increase of cropping intensity as well as \\nyield. Irrigation efficiency will be ascertained and modern water management technology will be promoted \\nto enhance irrigation efficacy and water productivity through optimal use of available water resources. As \\npart of the strategy, water reservoir s and rainwater harvesting in rainfe d, coastal  and hilly areas will have \\nto be encouraged, and small -scale water resources systems would be developed along with monitoring the \\nmaintenance of the small -scale water resources infrastructure at local levels by ensuring community \\nparticipation an d taking care of environmental and social issues.  \\nDevelop and improve embankments, barriers and water control structures: Bangladesh has set up a \\nnational target of becoming a high -income country by 2041, for which lots of economic activities are on-\\ngoing  and several others are in the pipeline. However, due to the climate change, extreme flood may occur \\nfor which the economic strongholds including major urban cities need higher level of protection. Therefore, \\nconstruction of new embankments and other water control infrastructures as well as strengthening and/or \\nmaintenance of the existing structures are needed at economic priority zones, major urban cities, etc. \\nMoreover, building and maintenance of fish passes and fish friendly structures to ensure fish mov ement to \\nfacilitate seasonal migration of fish for breeding and grazing will be emphasized.    \\n \\n327 \\n Restoration, redesign and modification of embankments and structures: There is lots of flood control , \\ndrainage and irrigation (FCDI) schemes in Bangladesh. But, du e to lack of operation and maintenance \\n(O&M), most of those schemes are not fully functional, raising the vulnerability to flooding. Many \\nembankments and structures need to be restored, redesigned and modified. Flood management and flow \\nmaintenance measure s have to take into account the prevalent of submerged chars that become more \\nprominent during the dry seasons. Restoration, redesigning and modification of embankments and other \\nsuch FCDI structures should be undertaken to fully accommodate the prompt and  timely drainage of the \\nexcess water from upstream catchments, especially when subsequent peak flows converge.  \\nAdopt spatial planning and flood hazard zoning:  The spatial planning and flood hazard zoning are \\nimportant to categorise the critical areas. Floo d safety levels will be set up and protective measures will be \\nimplemented by these categories. Development of effective financial and legal instruments for spatial \\nplanning, zoning and implementation, including capacity building, flood hazard mapping and modelling \\nwill be implemented.  \\nExtension of the flood warning lead time:  The flood early warning system needs  to be updated and the \\nlead time needs to improve. The dissemination system will improve for delivering the warning to the local \\npeople with a hig her lead time. Community based early warning services will be extended, including flood \\nagents and networks for communication and action. A strong cooperation will be developed between \\ninstitutions responsible for hydrology (BWDB), meteorology (BMD), model ling (institutes and centres), \\ndissemination and early actions.  \\nImprove operation and maintenance:  The operation and maintenance of projects is a major problem due \\nto lack of timely funding, for which many of the structures are becoming non-functional . So, improvements \\nin the operation and maintenance system are  a must for increasing the functionality of the schemes. The \\ncompleted projects of water resources sector especially the flood control, drainage and irrigation project \\nwould be properly operated and maintained with the participation of stakeholders so that the targeted \\nbenefits of the projects are ensured. Institutional and financial capacity will be strengthened for these \\nactivities.  \\nRestoration of water bodies and connectivity:  Sedimentation and hu man interventions have made the \\nrivers and khals congested for flowing water. Policies will be undertaken to restore water bodies and to \\nimprove connectivity between floodplains, wetlands and rivers.  \\nRiver management, excavation and smart dredging:  The riv ers are silting up which reduces the efficient \\nflow of water. Excavation and smart dredging are needed for the management of the river system. In \\naddition, maintenance dredging will be needed to clear out submerged chars developed through years of \\nsiltatio n and decreasing conveyance capacity of flow as well as obstruct navigation routes of major rivers. \\nNavigation routes have to be kept running perennially through regular dredging. Dredging dump locations \\nor “balumohol” locations have to be circulated that they do not get struck in one location and management \\nof this silt has to be well accounted for.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n328 \\n Basin -wide Water Resources Development Initiatives:  \\nRegional cooperation is highly important for sharing of water resource of common rivers and for integrat ed \\nriver basin management. River Basin Organizations (RBOs) can help address the issue of common river \\nbasin management through implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) at river \\nbasin level and comprising representatives from the resp ective member riparian countries. Basin wise \\napproach helps develop the basin as an integrated unit and minimize the investments cost in flood control \\nand other water resources development projects. There are no basin wide organizations in existence for th e \\nSouth Asia region. The following framework has been proposed in the BDP 210 0:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ganges River Basin Organization - comprising Bangladesh, India and Nepal;  \\n\\uf0b7 Brahmaputra River Basin Organization - comprising Bangladesh, India, Bhutan and China; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Meghna/ Ba rak River Basin Organization - between Bangladesh and India.  \\nEnsuring safe water to sustainable drinking water and sanitation:  Sustainable use and availability of \\nsafe water for drinking and sanitation purpose will be ensured. Initiatives will be undertake n to encourage \\nrainwater harvesting where feasible. Besides, increasing storage in existing water retention bodies should \\nbe promoted.  \\nMaintaining water quality for health  and nutrition , livelihoods and ecosystems: This involves both \\nprotection of environm entally valuable and sensitive areas and the prevention of pollution by enhanced \\ntreatment. Urban drinking water and sanitation authorities are key actors in implementing proper \\ninterventions to ensure quality of freshwaters.  \\nIncrease drainage capacity an d reduce flood risk at the coastal zone: The drainage congestion in the \\ncoastal zone is a big issue. It happens due to less capacity of the river and sedimentation with the tidal \\neffect. Thus, increasing the drainage capacity will reduce the flood risk. Me asures will be undertaken to \\nrestore rural rivers/canals and livelihood improvement in coastal districts. The flood risk is very high in the \\ncoastal zone and it becomes disastrous when flooding coincides with tidal surges. Therefore, flood risk \\nprevention strategies and proper preparedness will be implemented in a timely manner.  \\nExpansion of Surface Water Irrigation: Regional groundwater irrigation schemes have been developed \\nin the north -western  part of the country which sufficiently contributed to increa sing productivity. Excessive \\nuse of groundwater for irrigation has longer term ecological consequences. The BDP 2100 emphasizes on \\nthe development of surface water irrigation schemes. The following measures are proposed:  \\n\\uf0b7 Augmentation of surface water for irrigation through development of water reservoirs recharges  \\ngroundwater, and reduced use of groundwater. Key priority investment activities include:  \\n \\n(i) The development of small -scale surface irrigation in the southern part of the country requiring \\nnew infra structure and capacity building;  \\n(ii) Partially reduce reliance on deep well irrigation in the northern part of the country, reduce costs \\nand mitigate the risk of depleting groundwater;  \\n(iii) Rehabilitate dykes and embankments particularly affected by previous cyclon es to protect \\nvulnerable households and production base against sea intrusion in the extreme south;    \\n \\n329 \\n (iv) Improved drainage, saline intrusion control and flood management; and  \\n(v) Increasing river water flow towards the south, in particular involving Major River  dredging \\neffort.  \\n(vi) Initiative to create water reservoirs to retain water to fulfil  dry seasonal water demands has to \\nbe taken.  \\n(vii) Steps have to be taken towards construction of Brahmaputra Barrage, 2nd Teesta Barrage and \\nPadma Barrage . \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Use water saving technol ogy for improving efficiency of water and install facilities to reduce \\ndistribution losses. Activities include: reduce water losses in existing schemes through improved water \\nmanagement (capacity building of water management cooperatives); development of w ater saving \\ntechniques such as drip irrigation, buried pipe irrigation, ‘fertigation’; or rehabilitation of existing \\nschemes.  \\nReduce impact of saline water intrusion in the south and enhance river water flow. The focused activities \\nthat emerged from the BD P 2100 consultations are: rehabilitation of polders and their management; \\ndredging of rivers; enhanced surface water irrigation; and improved brackish water resource management \\npractices.  \\nReclaim new land in the coastal zone: Extensive research will be co nducted on morphological behaviour \\nto gather knowledge about the influence of land reclamation and to realise the potential of further \\ndevelopment and artificial interventions for enhancing accretion process. Building cross dams at the \\nstrategic locations would be useful for accelerating land reclamation process for which potential cross dam \\nprojects would be undertaken with proper feasibility studies. Land reclaimed through accretion process \\nneed to be protected and developed with land zoning and other app ropriate measures.  \\nStrengthening river and estuaries management in the newly accreted char areas: Appropriate \\nmeasures will be undertaken for the development of newly accreted char areas. The strategies will \\nincorporate development of newly accreted char lands in the coast of the Meghna and all other rivers; \\nintegration of river management with urban development planning and programming; program for capital \\nand maintaining dredging in the river Padma, Meghna, Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Dharla, Arial Khan, \\nKushiy ara, Gorai, Manu and other important rivers; integrated urban and spatial planning for urban \\ndevelopment in newly accredited  areas; developing industrial parks and agricultural activities; and also \\nsalinity management in the southern rivers during dry seas on. \\nProtect agriculture and vulnerable communities in haor and flash flood areas: Pre-monsoon flash \\nflood from the neighbouring  hilly region is a common phenomenon in haor areas. As a result, the numerous \\nlarge, deep depressions are flooded, causing damage s to the Boro crop immediate before the harvest. A \\nnumber of Flood Control, Drainage & Irrigation (FCDI) projects have reduced damages from flash floods \\nparticularly in Surma -Baulai and Kushiyara river systems. These existing FCDI projects should be \\nmainta ined with developing integrated water control structures in response to the future climatic scenarios \\n(rainfall intensity and peak discharges of the major rivers) developed by in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. \\nAlso, increasing the conveyance capacity of t he flashy rivers through strategic and maintenance dredging, \\nand re -excavation is needed. To protect the post -harvest crop from rotting in haor and flash flood areas, \\nprivate and public initiatives and investment in intensive agriculture should focus on ar eas where much \\nhigher returns on investment are possible through homestead gardening and intensive livestock production.   \\n \\n330 \\n Mechanization needs to be promoted in the haor and flash flood area for quick land preparation, planting, \\nweeding, harvesting, processi ng, drying etc. The raised platforms which are proposed to be built with \\ndredged spoil may be utilized to increase cultivation of homestead vegetables, pulses, spices and fruits. \\nThis in turn will improve nutrition and increase household income.  \\nImplementi ng NRCC recommendations for conversation of rivers, water and biodiversity: The NRC \\nCommission has made 124 specific recommendations for the conservation of rivers water, environment and \\nbiodiversity. The specific recommendations will be implemented with t he participation of and collaboration \\nwith all actors, organisations, departments and authorities at the local and national level. One notable \\nsuggestion is the implementation of 3R (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) technology to dispose of all kinds of \\nurban a s well as rural domestic and industrial wastes to protect river and water bodies. Under the close \\nsupervision of NRC Commission, ten committees have been formed to prepare master plans of ten regions \\nof the country to free the rivers, canals, water bodies,  haor-baor, and coastal areas from illegal grabbers; \\nprevent river water pollution; conserve the environment, ecology and biodiversity of rivers; improve \\nnavigability; prevent river erosion; undertake flood control and river development multipurpose usages . \\nThese master plans will be approved and implemented in a timely manner, along with the existing master \\nplans on the Buriganga, Turag, Shitalakshya, Dholeshwari, and Karnaphuli.    \\nStrategy for water resources in Chattogram Hill Tracts: In the hotspot ‘Ch attogram Hill tracts’, both \\nthe hills and related coastal plains are considered, as problems experienced in the hills, like landslides, are \\nrelated to coastal plain problems like sedimentation and recurrent dredging. The strategies that will be \\nconsidered for the development and management of CHT water resources include  protecting economic \\nzones and towns from floods and storm surges; developing cyclonic storm surge and tidal flood risk \\nmanagement; Ensuring water security and sustainable sanitation; integr ating erosion management in the \\nhills by creating green belt, eco -friendly structures, soil and water conservation, and reforestation; \\nDeveloping catchment and sub -catchment management plans; protecting and restoring water -related \\necosystems, including for ests and hill sides; and promoting sustainable cultivation practices and \\nregeneration of degraded areas.  \\nStrategy for trans boundary  water management: As Bangladesh is located in the low -lying delta of the \\nGanges - the Brahmaputra - the Meghna basins, water  resources management is complex and highly sensitive \\nto upstream developments. As the lowermost riparian recipient of water from the Ganges, the Brahmaputra \\nand the Meghna, which also flows through India, China, Bhutan and Nepal, any intervening developme nt \\nupon the river dynamics and/ or morphology; either individually or bilaterally can further aggravate the \\nalready vulnerable scenarios Bangladesh is currently facing in terms of water availability.  \\nSeveral developments have been made over the years in te rms of trans boundary  water sharing and \\nmanagement. Closer cooperation has to be ensured with neighbouring  countries in view of the general \\nunderstanding that joint cooperation outweighs individual development. Allocation of substantial amounts \\nof water sh ould be ensured for ecological maintenance of rivers, especially during dry season is required. \\nThe BDP2100 highlighted the following strategies for trans boundary  water management on which \\nsubstantial effort will be made during the 8th Plan period:  \\n\\uf0b7 Incor poration of multi -layered dialogues that will enable participating countries to initiate \\nnegotiations from new entry points and also link water related negotiations with other river interests \\nand regional cooperation issues. They will be characterized by a n open environment to enable \\nparticipants to understand the viewpoints of other parties, where the contributors are not hampered   \\n \\n331 \\n by political or other power -oriented position holders. Issues such as climate change and its \\nconsequences can be discussed in p arallel in conjunction with other river basin management issues \\nas it has a profound effect upon many aspects of water availability and management.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Besides, multi -track water diplomacy has to be applied to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts \\nrelated t o water availability, its allocation or use between and within states for better understanding \\nof trans boundary  issues and to ensure effective formulation and implementation of common river \\nbasin management schemes related to joint usage and equitable all ocation of water resources that \\nare centred  on the concept of benefit sharing.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 It is imperative that environmental flow is maintained in the rivers and as such, necessary initiatives \\nhave to be taken both on a bi - and multi -lateral basis and enacted acco rdingly. Discharge and quality \\nmeasuring stations need to be established and regularly monitored at different locations on the river.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Simultaneous negotiation of multiple treaties has to be done to ensure that the benefits given up on \\none treaty could be used as leverage for another more significant treaty. Instead of attempting to \\nagree on one treaty at a time, negotiation of multiple treaties would be a better approach to gain \\noptimal outcomes for Bangladesh. By applying the negotiation of multiple treat ies approach, both \\ncountries have more options to come to mutually agreeable and beneficial terms.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Prioritization of rivers has to be done in implementing devised schemes regarding water sharing. \\nBangladesh and India have been sharing the Ganges water at Farakka since signing of the treaty in \\n1997. Discussions are also being held for augmentation of the dry season flows. Framework of \\nagreement for sharing of Teesta needs to be developed as a treaty. Similarly, water sharing policy \\nfor the six other priorit ized trans boundary  rivers namely the Dharla, the Dudhkumar, the Manu, \\nthe Khowai, the Gumti, and the Muhuri need to be implemented at technical level.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Demand based common river basin management schemes has to be initiated where the involved \\ncountries wil l weigh in their views regarding mutually beneficial river management and solve \\ncommon issues both bi - and multi -laterally through construction of necessary infrastructure on \\noptimal hydrological and ecological locations within the river basins.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Internati onal approach can be implemented that will involve active participation of a third party, \\neither an international organisation or a country. In order to ensure the effectiveness and acceptance \\nof international involvement, both countries need to agree firs t to do so to ensure the legitimacy of \\nthe mediator to all concerned parties . \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Benefit -sharing “mutual gains” model has to be implemented that discourages unilateral actions \\nand further encourages coordination between riparian countries. The concept behind  mutual gains \\nis to incorporate non -water issues into the negotiation process to augment the basket of benefits. \\nThe framework agreement has opened the opportunity for conducting negotiations through \\nestablishment of joint body river basin organizations in  pursuing common river basin management. \\nInvolving various sub -regional cooperation issues such as in power sector or navigability and \\nphysical connectivity can greatly enhance the mutual gains basket.  \\n   \\n \\n332 \\n \\uf0b7 Legal and political -economy analysis has to be perfor med, focused on specific challenges to be \\nencountered. Identification of key zones of possible effective cooperation can be done to develop \\nconcrete recommendations on how to foster effective cooperation.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strategies have to be devised to combat the implic ations of the adverse effects of climate change \\nupon the river basins.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Furthermore, knowledge building on hydro -diplomacy would be useful for the transboundary water \\nnegotiations.  \\n4.6.4  8FYP Priority Public Investment Programme for Implementation of BDP2 100  \\nThe Bangladesh Delta Plan Investment Plan (BDP2100IP) consists of a total of 80 projects: 65 are physical \\nprojects, and 15 are institutional and knowledge development projects.  The total capital investment cost is \\nBDT 2,978 billion (US$37 billion) in  2015 prices. All projects can be started within the next eight years, \\nthough given the scale and programmatic nature of some investments, construction  in some cases may \\nextend over decades.   \\nThe 80 projects were then grouped into the seven ‘Hotspots’ defi ned in the Delta Plan. These hotspots were \\ndeveloped from consideration of the Delta’s distinct hydrological regions, and the type and magnitude of \\nthe natural hazards in each. There are six geographic hotspots: 1) Coastal Zone 2) Barind and Drought \\nProne Areas 3) Haor and Flash Flood Areas 4) Chattogram Hill Tracts 5) River System and Estuaries and \\n6) Urban Areas. A seventh, cross -cutting hotspot addresses common issues that cut across the six \\ngeographical hotspots. Where appropriate, similar projects in h otspots were further grouped together into \\nsub-programmes , such as improved urban water supply and sanita tion, irrigation in the Barind and Haor \\nflood management. These sub programmes  promote scale, coordination, and learning economies in \\nimplementing these  projects.  \\nIn the second step, the PIP is broken down into suggested programmes for 8FYP and the 9FYP. The details \\nof the suggested program for the 8FYP are contained in Annex Tables A4.1 and A4.2. The summary \\nfeatures of the proposed new delta investment programmes  for the 8FYP by hotspots, program objectives \\nand indicative aggregate cost measured in 2015 prices are shown in Table  4.12. The total new Delta \\ninvestments proposed for the 8FYP amounts to 47 new projects  involving a total cost of BDT 1400 billion \\nor US$17.6 billion in 2015 prices.   These convert to Taka 1940 billion in FY2021 prices (US$21.7 billion).  \\nTable 4.12: Proposed Delta Public Investment Programmes  (PIP) for the 8FYP (2015 Prices)  \\nHotspot  Progra mme Name / Coverage  Cost (billion ) \\nProgram me 1 \\nUrban Areas  Flood Free Cities  \\nImprovement of Drainage Congestion, Canal Dredging and Flood Control for \\nDhaka, Chittagong, Barisal, Khulna Cities  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: UA 1.2; UA 1.3; UA 3.1; UA 9.3;  UA10.1; UA \\n11.1.   \\n-- BDT 138.8  \\n-- US$ $1.75  \\nProgram me 2 \\nBarind and \\nDrought Prone \\nArea  Barind New Food Belt  \\nRevitalization and Rationalization of Hurasagar / Atrai Rivers and Kurigram \\nIrrigation Project  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: DP 1.2; DP 1.21; DP 1 .3; DP1.4/1.5   \\n-BDT129.2  \\n-- US$ 1.63  \\n   \\n \\n333 \\n Hotspot  Progra mme Name / Coverage  Cost (billion ) \\nProgram 3  \\nChattogram Hill \\nTracts  Facilitating Living in the Hills  \\nRationalization of polders, Development of Catchment Management Plans and \\nKaptai Lake Rehabilitation Study with Pilot Project  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: CH 1.10; CH 1.11; CH 26.2; CH 26.1   \\n-- BDT16.7  \\n-- US$ 0.21  \\n \\nProgram 4  \\nCoastal Zone  \\n Safe and Resilient Coast  \\nIntegrated Coastal Zone Management (West -Gopalganj; Bhabadha Area; Bhola \\nIsland) and Polder Rationalization (Baleswar -Tentulia Basin; Gorai  Passur Basin; \\nGumti -Muhuri Basin)  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: CZ 1.8/1.21; CZ 1.11/1.38; CZ 1.26; CZ 1.3; CZ \\n1.48; CZ 1.41; CZ 1.44; CZ 1.40; CZ 1.45; CZ 1.47; CZ 1.30; CZ12.8   \\n--BDT358.6  \\n-- US$ 4.52  \\nProgram 5  \\nMajor Rivers  Stable and Lively Rivers  \\nRiver Stabilization and Enhancement of Char Land Investment Plan project \\ncodes: MR 1.1; MR 1.5; MR 1.46; MR 3.1; MR 12.1  -- BDT 205.1  \\n-- US$ 2.6  \\nProgram 6  \\nHaor Area  \\n Restoring Haor Ecosystems  \\nRationalization of Haors, Village Protection and Sustainable Wetla nd \\nManagement  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: HR 2.1/2.2; HR 1.1; HR 14.1; HR 14.3; HR 15.4/5   \\n--BDT 23.6  \\n-- US$ 0.30  \\nProgram 7 Cross \\nCutting  \\n Safe and Clean Water Supply  \\nClimate Resilient & Holistic IWRM, Piped Water Supply and Ground Water \\nManagement  \\nInvestment Plan project codes: CC 1.4; CC 1.3; CC 12.37; CC 16.19; CC 9.10; \\nCC 1.43; CC 1.45; CC 1.46; CC 18.5; CC9.17   \\nBDT 527.7  \\n-- US$ 6.65  \\n \\nTotal   --BDT 1399.7  \\n--US$ 17.63  \\nSource: BDP 2100  \\nThe distribution of project costs by line Ministries/ Divisions is shown in Table 4.13. The large allocation \\nfor the Ministry of Water Resources  is explained by the fact that BDP2100 is a water -centric program.  The \\nprogram priorities that emerged from the BD2100 strategy showed large gaps in key areas of water \\nmanagem ent and a catch -up effort is needed in the 8FYP.  Similarly, the substantial allocation for the Local \\nGovernment Division  explains the primary role of LGD in urban flood control, urban drainage, urban water, \\nand urban sanitatio n. These are critical elements  in Delta management with huge backlo g in services and \\ninvestments. For some Delta Ministries, the investment projects are largely in the nature of knowledge \\nbuilding, capacity development, and institutional reforms (e.g. land, environment and climate chan ge). In \\nsome others, the required investment project  is not developed yet (forestry, Chittagong Hill Tracts).   \\nTable 4.13: Distribution of  Proposed 8FYP Delta PIP by  Ministries/ Divisions /Departments  \\nSl.

The other two aspects relate to Delta policy framework and reforms of Delta \\ninstitutions. The agenda is large and the details are contained in the BDP2100 Main Report.   \\n4.7.1  Key Policy Reforms  \\nOn the policy front there are two types of policies: those which relate to the macro economy , financing of \\nthe Delta PIP and the role of private investment  in Delta -related projects; and those th at relate to sectoral \\npolicies. The sectoral policies mainly concern policies linked to environmental management, land \\nmanagement, water management (including cross -boundary river management), agriculture, forestry a nd \\nfishery resource management, urban water, flood control and drainage, and inland water transport. These \\nsectoral policies are discussed in the relevant sectoral chapters of the 8FYP.   \\nRegarding the macroeconomic policies there are three critical policy  reforms that are already built in the \\nmacroeconomic framework of the 8FYP:  \\n\\uf0b7 The government will dutifully implement the fiscal framework for the 8FYP, which builds on the \\napproved fiscal framework of the PP2041. The most important policy assumption is that  the \\ngovernment will undertake critical tax reforms to enable tax revenue to grow from 8.9% of GDP in \\nFY2020 to 14% of GDP in FY2025. Without this critical reform the ability to implement  the 8FYP PIP \\nfor BDP2100 will not happen.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The government will inst itute cost recovery policies in urban water supply and in irrigation and flood \\ncontrol measures to allow revenues from cost recovery policies in these Delta programmes from 0.1% \\nof GDP now to about 0.3% of GDP by FY2025.  This is a modest target as the sco pe for cost recovery \\nfrom better services is immense. However, this calls for major reforms in City Corporations and \\nMunicipalities for cost recovery in urban water supply and for the establishment of effective Water \\nUser Associations (WUAs) in rural areas .  Explained below, both these institutional reforms are critical \\nreforms for sound implementation of the BDP2100.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The government will facilitate private participation in Delta investments. There is already a limited role \\nplayed by the private sector.  Th e BDP2100 highlights the many areas where private financing can be \\nstrengthened and accelerated.    \\n \\n335 \\n 4.7.2  Critical Institutional Reforms  \\nThe government has already instituted some important Delta -related institutional reforms.  These include \\nthe initiation o f the process for establishing the Delta Wing in General Economics Division (GED) of the \\nPlanning Commission and the process for establishing the Delta Fund led by GED. This process must \\ncontinue and be strengthened within the first year of 8FYP. Along wit h this, the 8FYP must focus on \\nimproving the O&M and project implementation capacities of all Delta line ministries and agencies; lay the \\nfoundations for decentralized water management that is critical for long -term sustainability of the BDP2100 \\nprogram; i nitiate Delta -related knowledge creation and dissemination channel; and lay the foundations for \\na comprehensive results -based Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System.  \\nEstablishing Sound O&M Practices  \\nAlong with investment in critical infrastructure on the O&M front, three actions are needed that must be \\ndone in the first year of the 8FYP.  These are:  \\n\\uf0b7 To determine the current O & M practice and their adequacy, a  quick review on existing O&M practices \\nin relevant Delta Ministries / Departments can be done.   \\n\\uf0b7 Based on that review, establish good O&M practices in terms of sources of funding, institutional \\naccountability, and monitoring and evaluation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Identify how the required institutional responsibility can be established, especially in the area of \\ncommunity ro le in O&M of local water -related infrastructure.  \\nStrengthening Implementation Capacities of Delta Ministries  \\nFor effective implementation of BDP2100, it is imperative to strengthen the core delta institutions. This is \\na tough challenge and involves long te rm effort.  Yet some core institutions require immediate attention in \\nthe context of the 8FYP.  These include: the BWDB, WARPO, DOE, the municipalities (WASAs, City \\nCorporations and Pourashavas), and all specialized institutions  \\nThe Ministry of Water Reso urces is the primary water management institution in the country. Its work is \\nsupported by a number of specialized agencies, particularly the two core ins titutions: BWDB and the \\nWARPO. Both institutions need considerable strengthening in new technology, in novation, integrated \\nplanning, research, economic management and consultative processes. They will also need to help out with \\nthe establishment of the local water bodies and learn to work with them collegially as a complementary \\ninstitution rather than as a competing institution. The evolution of decentralized water management will \\nface major challenges and will have obvious teething problems. WARPO and the BWDB can make this \\nprocess smoother and less costly through proper support and coordination.  \\nThe BWD B has a long history of involvement with water planning and implementation. BWDB has \\nexcellent water engineers, but is weak in areas of economic analysis, financing and institution building.  \\nThese gaps will have to be addressed with proper staffing of exp erts in the missing areas. Additionally, \\nBWDB must be encouraged to find innovative engineering solutions to water management problems in the \\nsame spirit as the Dutch Delta Works. Considerable interaction with water engineers in the universities and \\nintern ational training from countries like the Netherlands that have excelled in designing innovative \\ntechnical solutions to coastal belt management, river management, flood control and irrigation. Attention \\nshould be given to designing and adopting \"no regrets\"  engineering solutions to flood and irrigation \\nmanagement projects.      \\n \\n336 \\n The functioning of water municipalities (WASAs, City Corporations and Pourashavas) suggests  the need \\nfor substantial reforms. In particular, emphasis should be placed on converting thes e institutions into \\nautonomous bodies with considerable scope for cost recovery from users based on service provided. The \\ndemand for water and sanitation services in Bangladesh far exceeds the capacities of the municipalities, \\nespecially in small towns.  W hile some of the gap can be met through private participation, the capacity of \\nthe municipalities can be substantially strengthened by instituting sound cost recovery policies based on \\nbeneficiary and polluter pays principles. The transfusion of additional  resources through proper cost \\nrecovery can provide the impetus for strengthening the capacity of the municipalities and providing \\nadditional services.  This can also support innovative ways of encouraging good performance of \\nmunicipalities by linking budg et funding (block grants) with performance.    \\nTowards Decentralized Water Management  \\nPerhaps the most striking lesson from the Dutch experience with Delta management is the importance of \\ndecentralized management of the water resources.  The Dutch delta ma nagement essentially emerged \\nbottom -up as a decentralized water management system.  Historically, water safety efforts emerged from \\nthe land -owners fighting for survival from recurring sea and river flooding. These land owners formed \\nwater management assoc iations and funded investments from own resources.  Over time, as the country \\ndeveloped, the role of state in flood safety and other water management expanded.  Yet, this expanding \\nstate role preserved the historical decentralized approach and the result i s the modern participatory flood \\ncontrol and water management institutions. They  still are the dominant force for managing the waterways, \\nthe dikes and the water sewage plants and account for 50% of the annual water investment. The legal \\nframework for the water boards is provided by the Water Boards (regional water authorities) Act. Four \\ntypes of stakeholders have to be represented in these councils: (1) the residents or inhabitants of the area; \\n(2) the owners of real estate (farmers) consisting of open lan d which does not constitute a reserve or state \\nland; (3) owners of natural reserves; (4) businesses/industries. Since residents pay the largest share, they \\nhave the majority in the council.  \\nUnlike the Dutch experience water management is heavily centraliz ed. The absence of stakeholder \\nparticipation in water management is a major weakness in Bangladesh that needs immediate attention. The \\ngovernment made several attempts in the past but these have not succeeded. Moving forward, what are \\nneeded are some bold and radical efforts to create truly participatory local water bodies in the same spirit \\nas the Dutch water bodies.  The long -term success of Bangladesh Delta Management hinges critically on \\nthe establishment of these local water bodies.  \\nLocal/ Regional Wat er User Institutions   \\nThe missing institution in Bangladesh holistic water management is the representation of beneficiary \\nstakeholders linked with water use in various sectors including coastal management, river management, \\nfresh water wetlands (haors an d baors) management, large irrigation schemes and flood control as well as \\nwater supply and sanitation, inland transportation, industrial water use. Establishment of this missing link \\nin water management is an essential reform for successful management of the Delta Plan.  \\nThese required water user institutions (or water bodies) fundamentally must represent the stakeholder’s \\ninterests and usage and not government interests. The water bodies should be established based on: 1) a \\ncareful review of good practice s and international experiences including the Dutch experience; 2) analysis   \\n \\n337 \\n of the past approaches to establishing water user’s groups and associations in Bangladesh and the reasons \\nfor their success and failure; 3) doing additional stake -holder consultati ons. The full governance principles \\nincluding institutional design, membership, selection process, functions, financing and accountabilities will \\nbe provided in totality as a part of necessary legal arrangement.   \\nThe foundations for a more decentralized a pproach to water management must be initiated during the \\n8FYPicluding formation of local water management bodies as indicated in BDP 2100. Necessary studies \\ncan be undertaken for this purpose.   \\nLaying the Foundations of a Delta Knowledge Bank  \\nBuilding on the Dutch experience, BDP2100 noted that the creation of a delta knowledge bank is an \\nessential pre -requisite for undertaking adaptive delta management. There are several ways of doing this. \\nThe knowledge agenda is discussed in detail in chapter 15 of the BDP2100.  With the establishment of the \\nDelta Wing, this responsibility accrues to them. The institutional requirement is to create a knowledge unit \\nwith three main responsibilities:  \\na) collate all relevant delta related knowledge globally and nationally int o a digitized knowledge library;  \\nb) establish a delta data bank;  \\nc) develop and implement a comprehensive delta knowledge and data updating effort.  \\nTo initiate the implementation process for the Delta Knowledge Bank during the 8FYP, as a first step, the \\nDelta Wing should undertake a quick stock taking of existing Delta -related research and data. This report \\nshould be shared with other delta -related public agencies and with private research institutions to develop \\na knowledge and data upgrading agenda.  The Delt a Wing should review this agenda to check for \\nconsistency and relevance with the needs of the delta management, especially in the context of doing a \\nsound monitoring and evaluation of the Delta Plan, and develop a 3 -5 years data and research work \\nprogramme  with annual targets.  This report should be completed in the first year of the 8FYP and submitted \\nto the Delta Council for review and approval.  \\nFollowing approval, the knowledge work programme and budget, implementation may proceed.  Data work \\ncan be impl emented in conjunction with the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and other delta ministries. \\nResearch can be out -sourced to universities and local research institutions.  The Delta Wing should be \\nresponsible for coordination and oversight.     \\nDeveloping a Sound Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System  \\nThe practice of conducting M&E of government policies and programmes is a weak link in Bangladesh \\npolicy planning.  Water related M&E is no exception.  A solid M&E effort is essential for sound \\nimplementation of the delta plan in the context of adaptive delta management.  The BDP2100 assigns \\ninstitutional responsibility for M&E as follows.   \\n\\uf0b7 M&E for investment projects is the responsibility of the implementing agencies.  \\n\\uf0b7 M&E of sectoral policies and programmes sho uld rest with the concerned sectoral ministry and IMED.   \\n\\uf0b7 Regarding M&E of the entire Delta Plan, this is a key responsibility of the Delta Wing.    \\n \\n338 \\n The implementation of the Delta Plan level M&E should also commence during the 8FYP. As in the case \\nof implem entation of the knowledge agenda, the Delta Wing can draw on the technical capabilities of its \\nknowledge partners including WARPO, CEGIS, IWM, BUET and private research institutions to help with \\nthe development of a Delta Plan level M&E.  Needless to say, the M&E for the Delta Plan will need to be \\ndone consultatively, drawing on the analysis of the M&E at the project and sectoral levels and involving \\nall inter -ministerial agencies dealing with delta issues and the IMED. A draft M&E proposal should be \\nready for approval by the government within the first 18 months of the 8FYP.  Implementation can then \\nstart over the 19 -48 months of the 8FYP with the first M&E Report ready for government approval by the \\nbeginning of the 5th Year (FY2025) of the 8FYP.  \\n4.8 DEVELOPME NT RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATER \\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE 8FYP  \\nThe agriculture sector in Bangladesh is overwhelmingly private sector driven.  Yet, it is heavily dependent \\nupon public investment in rural infrastructure (rural road, irrigat ion, flood control, environmental \\nprotection, land management), forestry and agricultural services such as research and extension, storage \\nfacilities.  The adoption of the BDP2100 and the implementation of the associate  PIP for the 8FYP will \\nsubstantially rise the ADP spending, especially for water management where the gaps are large, especially \\nin the area of flood control, river bank management and restoration  of river courses to provide fresh water \\nsupply.  These are all highly capital -intensive projects  but are essentially to protect the water resources of \\nBangladesh and reduce the vulnerability of the poor from natural disasters .    \\nTaking into consideration the implementation of the first phase of BDP2100 PIP as 8th Plan are provided in \\nTables 4.14 in current prices and in Table 4.15 in constant prices.  Financing of large  transformational water \\nprojects included in the BDP2100 PIP for the 8FYP will require support from multilateral agencies like the \\nWorld Bank , JAICA  and the ADB and from bilateral sour ces such as the Netherlands , which has vast state \\nof the art technical experience in water management.  \\nTable 4.14: ADP Allocations for Agriculture Sector in the 8th Plan  \\n(Taka billion Current Prices)  \\n Ministry/Sector  FY 2021  FY 2022  FY 2023  FY 2024  FY 2025  \\nMinistry of Agriculture  41.2 46.1 47.9 49.7 59.6 \\nMinistry of Fisheries and Livestock  9.0 11.1 12.8 15.0 18.0 \\nMinistry of Land  7.1 8.8 10.1 11.8 14.2 \\nMinistry of Water Resources  108.6  156.9  228.7  276.2  346.4  \\nSector Total  165.9  222.9  299.5  352.7  438.2  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 4.15: ADP Allocations for Agriculture Sector in the 8th Plan  \\n(Taka Billion 2021 Constant Prices)  \\nMinistry/Sector  FY 2021  FY 2022  FY 2023  FY 2024  FY 2025  \\nMinistry of Agriculture  41.2 43.8 43.2 42.8 49.0 \\nMinistry of Fisheries and Livestock  9.0 10.6 11.6 12.9 14.8 \\nMinistry of Land  7.1 8.3 9.1 10.2 11.6 \\nMinistry of Water Resources  108.6  149.0  206.6  237.8  284.6  \\nTotal   165.9   211.7   270.5   303.7   360.0  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 5:  \\nPOWER AND ENERGY  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n341 \\n CHAPTER 5 \\nPOWER AND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  \\n5.1 BACKGROUND  \\nThe economic progress of past decade has seen rapid decline in poverty on the heels of rapid economic \\ngrowth with more people enjoying improvements in their material wellbeing . This has gone hand in hand \\nwith its transformation from primarily an agrarian economy to that which now has service sector and \\nindustry holding dominating share of GDP. The rapid development of the energy sector during the 6th and \\n7FYP  periods played a catalytic and enabling role in this, helping move forward the industrialization \\nagenda. The energy sector consists of electricity, gas, coal, liquid fuel, wind energy, solar and other non -\\npetroleum fuel. The critical role of assur ed supply of electricity at an affordable price for social and \\neconomic development is universally recognized, and government has also been trying to pursue this path. \\nWith more stable availability of electricity and primary energy, this period saw new fac tories being set up \\nat increasing rate across the country, along with growing urban centres  and cities; which in turn provide \\ngoods, jobs and homes, and amenities that make life more comfortable and enjoyable.  \\nBangladesh has now embarked on achieving a vi sionary goal of becoming a developed economy by 2041 \\nand for which it has adopted the Perspective Plan (PP) 2041.  Bangladesh will have to use its experience \\nand success in traverse towards becoming a competitive manufacturing hub, with diverse export base . A \\nmore efficient and low -cost power infrastructure along with a competitively functioning transparent and \\nwell-regulated primary energy sector could help strengthen the competitiveness of Bangladeshi \\nmanufacturing and export products. Energy  has always p layed pivotal role in emerging economies in \\naccelerating growth, particularly during the rapid industrialization phase leading to quality job growth, as \\nthey move from middle -income to upper -middle income and developed stage of development.  \\nDuring the Sixt h FYP and Seventh FYP period’s priority was given to increase generation capacity to meet \\ndemand; and at this point of time Bangladesh has surplus installed capacity. The policy and institutional \\nsupport during these periods were geared up to help leverage  private investments alongside public \\ninvestments in energy and power sector. The financing strategy emphasized both public funding as well as \\nfinancing based on public -private -partnership (PPP). Emphasis was also placed on improving efficiency \\nand service  delivery of relevant public agencies.  \\nThe Government will continue on this path, leading into the 8FYP , but with increased focus on energy \\nefficiency gain, renewable energy and financial sustainability.  This will enable Bangladesh to move to a \\ncompetitiv e and environmentally sustainable least - cost power generation, transmission, and distribution \\nsystem along with greater private sector participation and own resource mobilization so as to reduce the \\nburden on limited fiscal resources. The 8FYP  will also f ocus on timely implementation of all power and \\nenergy projects so as to optimize achieving the goals of Government’s energy sector strategy, whose key \\nelements are:  \\n   \\n \\n342 \\n \\uf0b7 A rapid growth in electricity generation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of transmission and distribution sys tem in line with generation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mobilizing private and joint -venture investment in power sector.  \\n\\uf0b7 Diversification of primary fuel for electricity generation , with special focus in increasing renewable \\nenergy generation.  \\n\\uf0b7 As part of its pursuit of the strategy o f least cost power generation, continue to have some highly \\nefficient least polluting coal plants  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving power sector efficiency and reducing transmission and distribution losses.  \\n\\uf0b7 Use of alternative sources of energy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Use of nuclear energy for power gen eration.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exploring electricity -trading options with neighbouring  countries (India, Nepal, Bhutan and \\nMyanmar).  \\n\\uf0b7 Use of alternative sources of financing (Export Credit Agency, etc.)  \\n5.2 POWER & ENERGY SECTOR  PROGRESS DURING 7FYP  \\nPower & Energy sector that has be en at the centre  of the infrastructure development vigorously pursued \\nboth during the sixth and the seventh FYP  periods, have  been catalytic in achieving the high growth \\ntrajectory that Bangladesh has been enjoying.  In the process it has also facilitated faster growing \\nmanufacturing and export sectors growth.  \\nAchieving the Development Results Framework (DRF) Targets:   The M&E targets set forth under the \\n7FYP , and depicted below in Table 5.1, provides a snapshot of the progress in achieving the strategic \\nobjectives of the energy sector, vis -à-vis the targets during the Seventh FYP period. It is clear that the M&E \\ntargets set forth under the 7FYP  have broadly been achieved.  Bangladesh power sector has been showing \\ntremendous progress since 2011, and at prese nt has generation capacity well above the demand. The \\nGovernment which had been implementing the power sector programmes  based on the Power System \\nMaster Plan (PSMP) 2010 during the 6th Plan period revised it to PSMP 2016, to help adapt to changing \\nscenari os. This growth in generation capacity along with expansion of transmission and distribution \\nnetworks have helped achieve substantial progress in both the indicators for the power sector: increasing \\ngrowth of per capita consumption of electricity and impro ving the access of the population to electricity.    \\nIn FY20 20 total installed capacity, inclusive of public, IPP, captive , import  and renewable energy reached \\n23,548  MW, higher than the target (Table 5.1). Electricity coverage has been increased to 97%, w hich was \\n72% in the baseline FY 2015. This has resulted in increasing per capita generation of 51 2 kwh (including \\ncaptive) from 371 kWh in FY 2015. During this period about 3. 70 crore consumers got connected to the \\nnational grid with 5. 67 lakh km. of distr ibution system. The overall system loss of electricity decreased \\nsubstantially to 11.23  per cent in FY2019 -20from 15.73 per cent  in FY20 09-10.  However, the share of \\nrenewable energy (including hydro) to the total electricity generation declined from 3.6% in FY 2015 to \\n3.05% in FY 20 20, which  needs to be increased during the 8FYP . \\n    \\n \\n343 \\n Table 5.1: Progress with the DRF Targets for Power, Energy during  the 7FYP  \\nPerformance \\nIndicators  Data \\nSource  Lead \\nMinistry/  \\nDivision  Base \\nYear \\n2015  (2018)  (2019)  (2020)  \\nTarget  Achievement  Target  Achievement  Target  Achievement  \\nElectricity Generation \\nInstalled Capacity \\n(MW)  PD PD/ \\nMoPEMR  13540  19249  18,753  20649  22,051  23000  23,548  \\nAccess to Electricity \\n(% of households)  PD, BBS  PD/ \\nMoPEMR  72% 90% 90% 94% 94% 96% 97% \\nPer Capita \\nGeneration of \\nelectricity (kWh)  PD PD/ \\nMoPEMR  371 454 464 483 510 514 512 \\nShare of renewable \\nenergy to the total \\nelectricity generation \\n(% including hydro)  PD PD/ \\nMoPEMR  3.6 7 3.15 8 3.25 10 3.05 \\nSource: Power Division .      \\nThe seventh plan perio d also saw progress in diversifying primary energy source through LNG imports, \\nand progress in construction of large sized coal fired power plant. There have also been several price \\nadjustments in all segments of the energy sector.  However, the progress i n expanding and diversifying \\nprimary energy supply, renewable energy, and in improving the energy sector finances has been limited. \\nThe areas of progress and concerns in electricity and primary energy are reviewed in greater detail below.  \\n5.2.1 Power Secto r \\nElectricity Installed capacity and generation: Bangladesh has been successful in overcoming the \\nshortfall between power demand and its supply through ushering in private IPPs while also undertaking \\nlarger public investments which is evident from sharp up turn in installed capacity as depicted in Figure 5.1.  \\nFigure 5.1: Trend in Grid Based Installed Capacity (MW)  \\n \\n    Source: Power Division  582372648716915110416115341236513555159531807920383\\n2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20  \\n \\n344 \\n Installed Capacity:  The available installed capacity ( exclusive of captive power and RE ), as depicted in \\nTable 5.2 b elow, increased from 11534 MW in FY 15 to 20383 MW in FY 20; out of which the share public \\nsector was 47% (9568  MW), that of the private sector (IPP) was 4 3% (8884  MW), joint venture was 4% \\n(771 MW) and 6% (1,160 MW) was from power import (Figure 5.2).  Du ring this period the generation \\ncapacity has also been increasing (Table 5.2), and the highest generation reached a high of 12,893  MW in \\n2019 June before falling slightly to 12738 in June 2020 .  It should be noted that inclusive of captive sources \\nand rene wable energy, the total installed capacity is 23,548  MW.  \\nTable 5.2: Installed Capacity (other than Captive Power and Off-Grid Renewable Energy) and \\nMaximum Generation  \\nFiscal Year  Installed capacity MW  Maximum generation MW  \\n2009 -10 5823  4606  \\n2010 -11 7264  4890  \\n2011 -12 8716  6066  \\n2012 -13 9151  6434  \\n2013 -14 10416  7356  \\n2014 -15 11534  7817  \\n2015 -16 12365  9036  \\n2016 -17 13555  9479  \\n2017 -18 15953  10958  \\n2018 -19 18961  12893  \\n2019 -20 20383  12738  \\nSource: BER 2019 & Power Division.   \\nFigure 5.2: Installed Capacity - Sector Wise June 2020  \\n \\n     Source:  Power Division  \\nPublic Sector\\n47%\\nPrivate Sector\\n43%Import\\n6%Joint Venture\\n4%  \\n \\n345 \\n Maximum generation lags behind installed capacity: However, maximum generation each year has \\nalways been less than the installed capacity (Table 5.2  above) , but the gap has been increasing  over the \\nyears.  All future generation plan needs to factor in this surplus generation position, as it will have \\nimplications on long -term sustainability of the sector, particularly in moving towards a least -cost generation \\nscenario and increased use of renewable energ y (RE) during the 8FYP  period. In this context there should \\nbe review on the higher cost and less efficient rental and other power plants, and look for ways to closing \\nthose and replacing t hem with more efficient ones including  increased generation f rom RE .  \\nAs of June 2020 , out of total net generation (Figure 5.3), 4 9 per cent  power was generated by public sector \\npower plants, 4 1 per cent  power from private power plants and 1 0 per cent  from power import. During \\nFY20 20, a total of 71,419  million kWh of net energy was generated that included 35,316  million kWh from \\npublic sector and 29,429  million kWh from private sector power plants  and power import 6674 million \\nkWh .  \\nFigure 5.3: Energy Generation - Sector Wise ( FY 2020 ) \\n \\n     Source: Power Division  \\nMobiliza tion of private investment in power generation:  The Government, as part of the Private Sector \\nPower Generation Policy (PSPGP) of Bangladesh of 1996, has been trying to increase share of the private \\nsector in power generation since the 6FYP , being mindful o f the financial constraints in the public sector. \\nThis has worked with substantial increase in new generation from private sources that started during the \\nSixth Plan, continuing into the 7th Plan period. Power generation has increasingly moved to the priva te \\nsector (Table 5.3), which is helping reduced use of public investment funds.  The share of private power, \\nincluding 1160 MW of imports, increased to 49% in terms of installed capacity from 43% in FY2015. If \\ninclude d captive and renewable energy then the  share of private sector installed capacity would be even \\nhigher; and total installed capacity would be 23,548  MW.

Bangladesh started with import 5 00 MW of power from \\nBalarampur , India from 2013, and has now enhanced the import 1000 MW from Borhanpur after \\nenhancement of the same grid substation capacity in June 2018. Besides 160 MW power is being imported \\nfrom Palatana, Tripura state since March 201 6, taking the total import of electricity from India to 1160 \\nMW.  \\nBangladesh has also been taking concrete initiatives to help open up new avenues for cross border electricity \\ntrade with other neighbouring countries - Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar - through bi lateral cooperation.  \\nEfforts are being made for import of hydropower from Nepal.  A MoU has been signed and LoI issued with \\nGMR group of India and NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) to facilitate import of 500 MW of \\nelectricity from Nepal. Power Purchase  Agreement shall be signed among BPDB & GMR.  There is also an \\ninitiative to facilitate import hydropower from Bhutan. In this regard, a tripartite MoU is at final stage \\nbetween Bangladesh, India and Bhutan, which can help facilitate construction of a power  plant through \\njoint investment. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Bangladesh and Myanmar exists. \\nBangladesh is also using multilateral platforms like UN-ESCAP, SAARC, BIMSTEC, SASEC and D -8 for \\nincreasing regional cooperation in energy trade.  \\nPower sector efficiency: There has been a visible improvement in power sector efficiency, which has also \\nresulted in reduction in the incidence of power outages. One important indicator of power sector efficiency \\nis the reduction in transmission and distribu tion (T&D) losses (Figure 5.4).  \\nFigure 5.4: Transmission and Distribution Loss (%)  \\n \\n                       Source: Power Division  15.73%14.73% 14.61% 14.36% 14.13%13.55%13.10%12.19% 11.87% 11.96%11.23%\\n0.00%2.00%4.00%6.00%8.00%10.00%12.00%14.00%16.00%18.00%  \\n \\n347 \\n A portion of the T&D loss has been power leakage, which has been substantially curtailed. The T&D losses, \\nwhich fell through out the 6FYP period - from 15.73% in FY2010 to 13. 54% in FY2015 – continued to do \\nso during the 7FYP period and declined further to 11.23 % in FY 2020 .   \\nDeclining distribution loss signifies improvement in sector governance. There has been particularly fast er \\ndecline in distribution loss, which has helped the continuous decline in T&D losses over time. The \\ndistribution loss had come down from 13.49% in FY 2010 to 11.3 6% in FY 2015, and declined further \\nthroughout the 7th plan period to reach 8. 73 % in FY 2020 (Table 5.4 below). While these have been \\nexcellent results within the time frame, there needs to be further improvement and brought to levels of \\nbetter performing entities in our peer group of countries.  \\nTable 5.4: Year - wise System Loss  \\nFiscal Year  Distribution Loss (%)  Total Loss (T& D) %  \\n2009 -10 13.49  15.73  \\n2010 -11 12.75  14.73  \\n2011 -12 12.26  14.61  \\n2012 -13 12.03  14.36  \\n2013 -14 11.96  14.13  \\n2014 -15 11.36  13.55  \\n2015 -16 10.96  13.10  \\n2016 -17 9.98 12.19  \\n2017 -18 9.60 11.87  \\n2018 -19 8.35 11.96  \\n2019 -20 8.73 11.23  \\nSource: Power Division  \\nDevelopment of  transmission and distribution system : Transmission of generated power from power \\nplants to the load centres  and then distribution to the end users’  needs to be ensured to achieve the real \\nbenefits out of su ccessful generation expansion program presented above.

Natural gas accounted for 53.8% and liquid fuel (Furnace Oil ( 27.2%) and Diesel ( 6.3%)) accounted \\nfor 33 .5% of the insta lled capacity. The installed capacity of power generation by fuel type as of June 2020 ) \\nis shown in Figure 5.6 below.  \\nFigure 5.6: Installed Capacity Share Exclusive of Captive Power (by Fuel Type)  \\n  \\n                 Source: Power Division  \\nHydro , 1%\\nNatural …Furnace …Diesel, 6%Coal , 6%\\nRenewable …Power …  \\n \\n350 \\n Actual generati on increasingly falling short of installed capacity: Given that actual generation has been \\nincreasingly less than the installed capacity there has been always effort to use lees of the more expensive \\nliquid fuel generation capacity. As a result, the share of gas in actual generation was higher at 71.82 % \\n(Figure 5.7) when compared to the installed capacity share of 5 4%, (Figure 5.6 above).  \\nFigure 5.7: Energy Generation - Fuel Type (January 2019)  \\n \\n       Source: Power Division  \\nThe share of imported power al so increased to 9.74%, while the share of liquid fuel in generation got \\nreduced to 13.44 % from the installed capacity share of 33%.  This was positive from efficiency point of \\nview , given that there is a surplus generation. While some surplus will have to be generated as reserve \\nmargin to ensure unhindered quality power supply during the 8th plan period and beyond, this will be done \\nin an optimum mode where efficiency of the reserve margin will also be considered.  \\nWhile natural gas had been the dominant fue l in use, liquid fuel use continued to increase during 7th \\nPlan Period:  As natural gas shortage expanded, the use of liquid fuel (Furnace Oil and Diesel ), increased \\nin public sector power plants ( Table 5.7), which exerted pressure on unit cost of power ge neration  This will \\nhave to change to reduce average cost.  \\nTable 5.7: Fuel Consumption by Public Sector Power Plants  \\nFiscal Year  Natural gas  \\n(Billion cft)  Coal  \\n(1000 Ton)  Liquid Fuel (Million Litre ) \\nFurnace Oil  HSD, SKO & LDO  \\n2009 -10 166 480 91 125 \\n2010-11 150 410 119 138 \\n2011 -12 151 449 172 60 \\n2012 -13 175 590 266 35 \\n2013 -14 183 539 424 175 \\n2014 -15 180 522 378 291 \\n2015 -16 207 489 439 238 \\n2016 -17 215 587 513 348 \\n2017 -18 211 825 615 795 \\n2018 -19 274 565 484 385 \\n2019 -20 267.76  1240  301.09  11.93  \\nSource: Power Division  \\nGas 71.82%Power Import \\n9.34%Renewables 0.09%Coal 4.16%Fuel 13.44% Hydro 1.16%  \\n \\n351 \\n The development of coal -based generation lags behind:  Both under the 6th and 7FYP  there was a strategic \\ndecision to increase the share of coal in generation, but it continues to lag behind, and its share fell from \\nthe level of FY201 5. Implementation and completion of planned coal fired plants has otherwise been very \\nslow, though there are some large sized coal fired power plants now at different stages of implementation. \\nCoal mining has not proceeded owing to the lack of a coal polic y.  The planned large -scale imports of coal \\nhave not moved fast enough owing to infrastructure constraints, particularly port and related transport and \\nhandling infrastructures.  \\nShare of renewable energy: Bangladesh has made limited progress in increasing  share of renewable energy \\nsources in generation of electricity. This remains a key challenge in moving towards a more sustainable \\nfuel mix. The share of hydro, which has been negligible (2%) in FY 2015 further declined during the 7FYP  \\nperiod. Besides, ano ther renewable source, Solar PV, also remains extremely negligible at 2.03%. During \\nthe 8FYP  the RE generation strategy will have to be aggressively pursued so that all that is planned gets \\nimplemented in time and where policy support is required should be  given forthwith.  \\nElectricity pricing policies: The rapid growth in the share of liquid fuel -based power supply from only \\n8% in FY2010 to 29% in FY2015 and over 30% in FY 2018 – continues to be a reflection of a major \\nprimary fuel constraint in Bangladesh . This has progressively increased the average supply cost of power \\nand had strained power sector finances. The average cost of power surged from Taka 6.10/KWh in FY2015 \\nto Taka 8.6/KWh in FY2020, which amounts to 41% between the periods. During past years , BERC made \\nadjustments of bulk and retail tariff rate of electricity keeping in view the financial capability of the \\nelectricity distributors, protecting the interests of the consumers and above all, bringing increasing financial \\ndiscipline in this sector . It appears that the increasing reliance on imported fuel oil (higher priced LNG and \\nimported coal) will continue in the future, and so will increase the production cost of electricity, unless \\nefficiency and other cost measures are taken.   \\nIntroduction of  lifeline tariff for poor and low -income group:  Considering the socio -economic condition \\nof the poor and lower middle -income consumers, BERC has fixed the lifeline tariff for residential user at \\n1-50 unit of electricity. It remained unchanged in the lates t tariff order. The electricity bill of poor and low -\\nincome residential subscribers has remained unchanged because of this regulatory step of BERC.  \\nPower subsidy: Even so, the average bulk supply tariff of electricity is less than the average cost of \\nprodu ction. The resulting financial losses continue to create pressure on the national budget. BPDB has \\nreceived budgetary support from Government due to loss between bulk supply cost and bulk supply tariff \\n(Table 5.8). Thus, the electricity budgetary support i ncreased from Taka 44 billion in FY2016 to Taka 74 \\nbillion in FY2020 .    The recent decline in international fuel oil prices could provide some relief for the \\nbudget. Yet, in view of uncertainties of international oil prices, electricity pricing and subsid y could still \\ncontinue to pose policy challenges during the Eighth Plan. Full cost recovery for all power and energy \\nproducts is an important goal for the 8FYP .  This will not only help lower the financial burden on the \\nTreasury, it will help conserve ener gy and support the development of renewable energy.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n352 \\n Table 5.8:  Power Budgetary Support (Taka billion)  \\nFiscal Year  Subsidy (Billion Taka)  \\n2015 -16 44 \\n2016 -17 40 \\n2017 -18 45 \\n2018 -19 78 \\n2019 -20 74 \\nSource: Power Division  \\nSector Governance: Improving Fi nancial Viability of the Power Sector  \\nTo improve financial viability and efficiency of the sector, in addition to power tariff adjustments awarded \\nby the BERC and reductions in T&D losses, the government has adopted a financial action plan to maintain \\npowe r sector receivable at no more than 2 months’ billed amount equivalent and reduce receivables from \\nautonomous, public entities and private customers to an acceptable limit.

As already discussed \\nearlier that Bangladesh during the 7FYP  period has ma de significant progress in reducing system loss and \\nalso in reduction of accounts receivable equivalent month to less than.  The reforms for reducing system \\nloss continue through installation of pre -paid meters. As of June 2020 , all the six distribution en tities \\n(BPDB, BREB, DPDC, DESCO, WZPDCL and NESCO) have made good progress in installation of these \\npre-paid meters, and have installed 3.32 million prepaid meters.

They also signify important improvements in \\nsector governanc e and sector management.  \\n5.2.2  Progress with Primary Fuel  \\nThe supply of primary energy comprising oil, gas and coal is to help meet energy demand of the country \\nby undertaking exploration, production, development and appraisal of oil, gas, and coal fields and \\nsubsequent energy reserve enhancement, and to meet energy shortfalls through imports.  Having adequate \\nsupply of low -cost energy is critical for all  segments of society in general  and in particular for having a \\ncompetitive and sustainable industry and an efficient power generation system that can benefit from an \\noptimal primary fuel mix. Another critical aim is to try and ensure energy security.   \\nGas Sector  \\nNatural Gas Production and Sector -wise Consumption: Natural gas accounts for 71 per cent  of the \\ncommercial energy fuelling power, fertilizer, industrial, commercial and domestic consumption of the \\ncountry. Till now, 27 gas fields have been discovered in the country. The domestic gas production is divided \\nbetween public (Petrobangla) and private produ cers (International Oil Companies). According to the latest   \\n \\n354 \\n estimation of Petrobangla total initial gas in place (GIIP) is 39.82 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of which 28.23 \\nTCF is recoverable in proven and probable categories. From 1960 to June 2020, total 1 7.79 TCF gas was \\nproduced cumulatively and leaving recoverable 10.43 TCF.   Status of gas production and reserves is \\npresented in Table 5.10.

The second FSRU, with similar capacity, was installed by Summit LNG \\nTerminal Co. Ltd. and was commissioned in April 2019. Both FSRUs are in the Bay of Bengal near \\nMoheshkhali, Cox’s Bazar . Government  has also a plan to set up an onshore LNG Terminal at Matarbari, \\nCox’s Bazar  with a capacity of 7.5 million tons per year having an expansion provision up to 15 million \\ntons per year. Before construction of onshore (Land Based) LNG terminal, Go vernment has decided to \\nconduct Feasibility Study to attract the investors in construction of the terminal on BOOT basis.   \\nBangladesh has already signed a long term (15 Years) LNG Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Ras -\\nLaffan Natural Gas Company Limited ( 3), Qatar to supply 1.8 to 2.5 MTPA of LNG. Another long term \\n(10 Years) SPA has been signed with Oman Trading International (OTI), Oman to supply 1.0 MTPA  of \\nLNG. Besides,  Master Sales Purchase Agreement (MSPA) has been signed with 14 short listed LNG \\nsuppliers/traders to supply LNG on Spot basis.  \\nCoal:  \\nIn Bangladesh 05 coal fields have so far been discovered. The total reserve in these 5 coal fields is about \\n7,962 million tons, and as of June’2020 total 11.78 million tons of coal  has been extracted. 525M W \\nelectricity is generated and supplied to national grid, using this coal. At present, about 1 million metric tons \\nof coal is being produced annually from the only coal mine at Barapukuria, Dinajpur. In March’2020; a \\nfeasibility study has been completed to  develop another underground coal mine at Dighipara, Dinajpur with \\nan average target production of 2.8 million tons of coal per year.  To meet up the coal demand for power \\ngeneration from domestic sources, Petrobangla has a plan to develop other two coal fi elds at Jamalganj and \\nKhalaspir by the year 2041.  \\nAs part of strategy it has been emphasized under PP 2041 that it would be necessary to extract more \\ndomestic coal for long term energy security. Domestic coal is superior in quality compared to imported \\ncoal. Development of already discovered coalfield requires a large initial investment, which will yield a \\nhigh return in future. On the other hand, the use of imported coal requires heavy investments in port, storage \\nand transport infrastructure. So, a phase d approach will be used. Several programmes  are underway, like \\nthe Rampal Power Project using coal imported from India, and the Matarbari Coal Transshipment Terminal \\n(CTT).  \\nIssues in Oil Sector:  \\nPetroleum Products:  Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) im ports, acquires, stores and markets \\npetroleum products. It develops and maintains storage facilities to preserve sufficient stock of petroleum \\nproducts. The current storage capacity of petroleum products is around 1.33 million metric tons. BPC has \\ntaken se veral initiatives, including setting up a new unit of the existing refinery (ERL Unit-2) of the ‘Eastern \\nRefinery Limited (ERL)’.  and initiating several pipeline projects to improve supply capacity.

The international petroleum market is volatile, and it is \\nimportant to be able adjust prices accordingly. But, BPC had traditionally incurred losses due to non -\\nadjustment of oil price in the domestic market in conformity wit h increases of oil price in the international \\nmarket. As a result, government had to provide large annual subsidies for importing petroleum products \\nduring those periods. Since November 2014, the price of oil has fallen in the international market. So, \\ngovernment has not been giving any subsidy in the FY2015 -16, FY2016 -17 and FY2017 -18. During, \\nFY2018 -19, however, BPC again started making loss in furnace oil and diesel as international oil prices \\ngradually started to creep up. Recently because of demand col lapse due to the COVI D 19 crisis and also an \\nunprecedented international price war saw collapse in international oil price.  This is expected to continue \\nin the forthcoming future, and strategies, including price deregulation needs to be pursued.   \\nIssue o f Adulteration in Imported Oil and negative on power plant efficiency: Currently, the power \\nand transport sectors are the largest consumers of imported oil. The quality of the imported oil play is a \\ncritical factor in improving efficiency, as even very lim ited variation in fuel oil specifications such as \\nspecific gravity; viscosity and water content can have serious effects on the power plants output. Any \\nsubstandard fuel for power generation can directly affect the tariff received from end consumers in ter ms \\nof increased FO consumption and increased O & M cost owing to the deteriorated imported fuel oil. \\nSimilarly, substandard oil when used in transport sector will also cause increased wear and tear of engine, \\nthus enhancing the O&M cost coupled with decrea sed mileage. Thus, lack of quality and quantity assurance \\nin terms of procuring fuel oil is one of the serious concerns in this sector, and needs to be addressed and \\nrectified during the 8FYP period. The PP2041, as part of long -term strategy, has expressed  intention to \\nbroaden the role of the private sector in the development of the oil and gas markets through deregulation \\nand pricing reforms. Private provision of these services while promoting investment, increasing competition \\nand consumer choices, can al so reduce scope of adulteration.  \\nDevelop the required infrastructure for primary fuel to bring efficiency in power production:  LNG \\nand imported coal will grow to be the key primary fuel source for generating power; and both are heavily \\ninfrastructure -depen dent fuel options. Major investments will be needed in ports, storage facilities, rail and \\nroad infrastructure to connect these imported fuels to the power plant. Without proper coordination, the \\nrelated power investments will fail to deliver.  \\nElectricity  through Renewable Energy (RE):  There is a growing trend in the international arena to \\npromote renewable energy, as part of energy security as well as greenhouse gas emission reduction. Many \\ncountries have adopted renewable energy promotion policies, such as feed -in-tariffs (FIT) and various   \\n \\n358 \\n incentives. Bangladesh also has taken different steps to produce environment - friendly electricity from \\nrenewable energy. The Vision  2021 and COP -INDC also promise that Bangladesh’s renewable generation \\ncapacity share w ill become 5% by 2015 and 10% by 2021. After the formulation and start of implementation \\nof renewable energy policy from 2009, the government had established ‘Sustainable and Renewable Energy \\nDevelopment Authority (SREDA)’ in 2014 under Sustainable and Ren ewable Energy Development \\nAuthority Act, 2012 to facilitate sustainable energy i.e. renewable energy as well as energy efficiency. \\nAccording to the law, SREDA had been established for effective utilization and conservation of RE both \\nin public and private sector.  \\nThe 7FYP  had recognized that need for continued effort to accelerate the implementation of scalable power \\ngeneration through renewable energy, considering the challenge of primary fuel. Government has set target \\nto generate 10% of the total genera tion from renewable energy sources by 2021.  It was particularly \\nemphasized to help meet the demand in areas where providing grid -based supply would not possible. The \\nEighth plan will continue on the seventh plan focus on two main areas of renewable energy:  solar and wind \\npower.  There is already significant success in the area of solar energy  in home lighting. The roof top solar \\nPV systems have been successfully introduced in the country. Table 5.1 4 shows the plan that had been \\ntaken up by SREDA for adding renewable energy during the 7th Plan period and start of the eighth plan \\nperiod.  \\nTable 5.1 4: Electricity generation plans form Renewable energy source (MW)  \\nTechnology  2016  2018  2019  2020  2021  Total  \\nSolar  200 350 250 300 250 1470  \\nWind  2.9 150 350 300 300 1153  \\nBiomass  0 6 6 6 6 30 \\nBiogas  5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 7 \\nHydro  230 1 1 2 2 236 \\nTotal  437.9  507.5  607.5  608.5  558.5  2896  \\nSource: SREDA  \\nAs of 2020 , 649.51 MW of electricity was generated from renewable sources. Additionally, 543 MW \\nrenewable projects had be en under construction and another 1416 MW renewable projects had been in the \\nplanning  stage.  Therefore, in all likelihood,  the 7FYP target for renewable energy will not be met .  Several \\nfactors have contributed to this including continued subsidization of  fossil fuel use and inadequate \\nincentives to renewable energy, both of which have adversely affected demand and supply of renewable \\nenergy.   There will be renewed effort to improve the focus and implementation of the RE policy during the \\n8th plan period.  \\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) and Energy Conservation (EC):  The Government continued to accord high \\npriority to the promotion of Energy Efficiency (EE) and Energy Conservation (EC) programmes  during the \\nSeventh Plan, with aim of achieving energy conversation ta rgets of 15% by 2020 and 20% by 2030; putting \\nin place energy efficiency and savings programmes  for electrical and electronic appliances; and \\nimplementation of energy standard and energy star labelling  program by BSTI. The government has \\nformulated ‘Energy  Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan up to 2030’, and ‘Energy Efficiency and \\nConservation Rules and Action Plan’, and numbers of interventions have been identified for \\nimplementation within stipulated time. A few of the specific achievements in improvi ng energy efficiency   \\n \\n359 \\n are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 ‘Energy Efficiency and Conservation Rules 2016’ has been formulated  \\n\\uf0b7 ‘Energy Audit Regulation 2018’ has been formulated  \\n\\uf0b7 ‘Energy Efficiency and Conservation Promotion Financing Project’ has been started to promote \\nenergy efficiency in industries as well as in residential sector through introducing energy efficient \\nequipment, appliances and electrical gadgets at 4 per cent  interest loan  \\n\\uf0b7 Credit facilities have been created in Bangladesh Bank for environment friendly and gree n \\nindustries  \\n\\uf0b7 Provision of Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation has been included in ‘Bangladesh \\nNational Building Code  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation and implementation of Country Action Plan for Clean Cook Stove  \\n\\uf0b7 Implementation of Improved Rice Parboiling System  \\n\\uf0b7 Formula tion of Net Metering Guidelines -2018  \\n\\uf0b7 Formulation of Guidelines for the Grid Integration of Solar Irrigation Pumps -2020  \\nEnergy Pricing and Subsidies  \\nFuel oil and gas also have major pricing issues; especially the big challenge is the pricing of diesel.  De spite \\nnumerous adjustments, the gap between average  cost and price is substantial. Bangladesh Petroleum \\nCorporation (BPC) imports crude and refined oil every year according to country’s demand. There are ups \\nand downs of refined and crude oil prices in int ernational market. The government did not need to give any \\nsubsidy between FY 2016 and FY 2018 because of falling global oil price. However, during FY2019, the \\nprices started to rise and BPC again started making loss in furnace oil and diesel. So, the chal lenge remains \\nof being able to adjust the diesel, furnace oil and other products smoothly and regularly to the changing \\nmarket conditions; as being effectively done in other countries including neighbouring  South Asia.  \\nIn the case of gas, there has been n o net financial loss because gas is produced domestically.  But gas prices \\nare very low in relation to the opportunity cost in terms of imported -fuel equivalence. However, in the \\ncoming years there will be increased use of imported LNG with domestic gas re serves depleting in \\nproduction of electricity. The LNG price will face the international price volatility, and will be requiring \\nregular price adjustments for sustainability. The 7th Plan had also encouraged use of LPG to reduce pressure \\non domestic gas. T here is growth in LPG, replacing domestic piped supply of gas, working more on market \\nprinciples.  \\nGiven the volatility of the international oil and gas markets, there will always be the high risk of falling \\nback into the oil subsidy regime, unless there ar e regular price adjustments. With the added dimension of \\nLNG imports and use of LPG, energy pricing will continue to be a major policy issue relating to proper \\npricing of electricity, fuel and gas. During the 8th Plan period price adjustments by BERC will need to be \\npursued so that need for subsidy can be avoided, and resources used for necessary investments in the energy \\nsector.  Proper pricing of fossil fuel energy products is also essential to promote production and use of clean \\nfuel options and to meet the environmental goals of Bangladesh including its commitments to the Paris \\nAccord on Carbon Emission Reduction.    \\n \\n360 \\n 5.2.3  Progress of Investment  in Power and Energy  \\nThe Seventh Plan strategy for financing energy investments involved both public investment th rough th e \\nADP and private investments. Regarding private investment in energy there has been significant success in \\nthe power sector, but less so in primary energy. As was noted in Section 5.2 above, there was considerable \\nprivate investment in the power s ector during the Seventh Plan.  While rental power dominated the sixth \\nplan, it was IPP during the seventh plan.  Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) has created \\nthree development funds in power and energy sector. These are (1) Gas Development F und (GDF), (2) \\nPower Sector Development Fund (PSDF) and (3) Energy Security Fund (ESF) in consultation with all the \\nconcerned stakeholders. The cumulative deposits in these funds up to May 2020 are Taka 36,894 cror es \\n(GDF 14,957 c rores, PSDF 10,252 crores and ESF 11,685 crores). So far 39 projects (including partly \\nfinancing to Pyra 1,320 MW Project and LNG bill payment) have been undertaken at a cost of Taka 22,502 \\ncrores. These funds are playing an important role in increasing the financing capacity of th e energy sector.  \\nIn primary energy, there were very limited new investments in offshore oil and gas exploration. Most new \\ninvestments in primary energy were funded publicly through the ADP. There are implementation \\nconstraints, which need to be resolved du ring the Eighth Plan.  \\n5.2.4  Progress with Institutional, Policy, and Regulatory Reforms in Energy  \\nThe energy sector is regulated by Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) to look after the \\ntariff of the consumer and industry. The Government has a dopted polices and legislations to set up long -\\nterm power development plan in order to reduce electricity production cost and ensure sustainable \\ndevelopment of power secto r. BPDB is in the process of identifying Strategic Business Unit (SBU) for its \\ngenera tion and distribution sectors as a new reform initiative. Functional and financial performance of the \\nSBUs will be operated like components of a corporate body and will be evaluated separately under the legal \\nframework of existing BPDB structure.  \\nBenchmark  Pricing System for increasing private participation in power generation : The BERC has now \\nintroduced “benchmark pricing system” for enhancement of private participation in the power sector. \\nBenchmark pricing is determined for other fuels such as gas, furn ace oil, coal, dual fuel (gas, furnace oil) \\netc. This system has been introduced so that domestic and foreign private sector can easily participate to \\npower generation. This is a step, which is the first in South Asia. Along with higher levels of investmen t, \\nthere continues to be significant progress with power sector reforms.  \\nThe unbundling of electricity system along functional lines, substantially improved O&M practices, \\ncomputerization of metering and billing practices, follow -up on bill payments and a ccounts receivables \\nsuggest considerable improvement in sector governance and management practices. The establishment and \\nfunctioning of the BERC, the successful implementation of the IPP policy and the increase of power trade \\nwith India, and initiation of  process for power import from Nepal and Bhutan are also important indicators \\nof on-going  institutional changes that have already a very positive effect on power sector performance over \\nthe longer term.   \\nGovernment also has taken action to reduce the requ ired documents and steps for getting electricity \\nconnection. As a result, it is possible to obtain electricity connection by 7 days for domestic connection and \\n28 days for industrial connection. In order to maximize operational efficiency\" Government has a lso   \\n \\n361 \\n prepared a draft policy for private participation in transmission sector. Government has also formulated net \\nmetering policy to encourage consumer to sell surplus electricity gener ated from rooftop solar system.  \\nThe following two  Acts, have been  adopte d during the 7FYP  \\n1. Electricity Act, 2018 has been enacted in the Parliament.  \\n2. Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act, 2018 (Ammended \\nupto 2021).  \\n \\nNevertheless, there are several areas where reform efforts need to continue , including: further unbundling \\nwhere feasible along the functional line; strengthening generation and distribution companies already in \\nplace to improve operating performance and customer satisfaction; implementing the power sector \\nrestructuring plan; adj usting electricity price gradually to average cost level; and strengthening BERC to \\nbe able to perform its agenda on licensing, energy pricing, quality of utility performance including energy \\nefficiency, and consumer satisfaction/dispute resolution.  \\nIn th e area of generation , the power generation expansion strategy (PSMP 2010) was updated to PSMP \\n2016.  There is a need to continue revisiting that plan to check for relevance in light of implementation \\nexperience of the past 4 years and the realism of the ge neration plan in the context of realities in the primary \\nenergy sector. Given the uncertainties in the supply side of primary energy, contingent planning will be \\nnecessary to have back -up power generation plans that respond to these uncertainties.     \\n5.3 EIGH TH PLAN STRATEGY FOR POWER SECTOR  \\nThe development of the power sector, which continued to remain on top priority during seventh plan, will \\ncontinue to remain so during the Eighth Plan period. In particular, it had received the necessary ADP \\nallocations and  the amount of resources increased progressively during the seventh plan, with positive \\nresults as shown in Section 5.2 above. Important successes have been achieved in the power sector in terms \\nof new installed capacities and associated supply of power. I n primary energy new investments were \\nmodest, but the progress with diversifying and increasing the supply of primary fuel has been very limited, \\nthough some large -scale coal fired power plants are under different stages of implementation and that \\nimported  LNG having been added to the pipeline.  \\nThe strategy for the power and primary energy sector during the Eighth Plan will build on the lessons of \\nexperience of the implementation of the Seventh Plan. An important priority will be to address any \\nimplementat ion gaps of the Seventh Plan. During the eighth plan period the effort will be to build a fiscally \\nsound efficient least cost power generation system, with increasing renewable energy as a source for power \\nproduction.  In this pursuit of least -cost generat ion, the priority should be efficiency gain and rightly \\nbalanced fuel mix. As pointed out  earlier , there has been a growing surplus generation capacity. The \\ngovernment wants to move towards least -cost generation scenario and has been implementing a number of \\nlarge size power plants that includes coal that is cheaper than HSD and Furnace Oil (Table 5. 15 below).  \\nThere are both a number public and private rental plants that use HSD and Furnace Oil -type high cost fuels.  \\nBesides , there is also small scale  IPPs, which may not be efficient. These need to be replaced by not only \\nmore efficient and least cost fuelled  power generation, but also by higher use of renewable energy -based \\npower generation.  A big challenge to overcome will be ways to retire inefficient po wer generation and   \\n \\n362 \\n taking a fresh look at the PPA’s because of the huge payment of capacity charges, and also the large gap \\nthat now exists between available capacity and actual use of that capacity. One big challenge in the primary \\nenergy sector continues  to be the absence of a strategic long -term view about how the growing needs of \\nprimary fuel will be met in the next 10 -20 years. Policy on primary fuel, particularly coal policy is urgently \\nneeded. The other important priority will be to address some of t he major institutional constraints that have \\nhampered implementation of energy projects. There also needs to be reform of the PPP strategy with a view \\nto achieving stronger progress with investments in primary energy during the Eighth Plan. Despite progres s, \\npower and energy pricing policies continue to be managed administratively. This will need to change as \\ncountry moves towards with greater reliance on market forces that will promote greater private investment \\nin the oil market, conserve energy, eliminat e the fiscal burden and support the production and use of clean \\nenergy.   \\n5.3.1  The Strategy for Power Sector  \\nThe 8FYP follows the growth path of the PP2041 that calls for a further acceleration in GDP growth during \\nthe 8FYP.  Although COVID -19 has put a temporary halt to growth acceleration, it is expected that the \\ngrowth momentum will resume from early calendar year 2021 as global growth also resumes.  So, the \\ndemand for power will continue to grow at 8% plus rate during the Eighth Plan period.  Country has invested \\nheavily in power generation capacity, leading to surplus situation compared to demand, improvement in \\ntransmission and distribution resulting in more than 97% of population’s access to electricity.  This progress \\nwas achieved through a strateg y that combined greater public investment in electricity, encouraging private \\nsupply of power, engaging in power trade with India and improving sector efficiency by sharply reducing \\nT&D losses.    \\nWhile Bangladesh has definitely made major strides in makin g substantive and visible improvements in \\npower generation and supply, there continues to be challenges which will need to be addressed in the 8FYP, \\nparticularly the need for improving efficiency and reducing costs so that power can competitively be \\nsuppli ed to its industries, particularly export industry, along with agricu lture and other commercial use. In \\nthis context Bangladesh has to consistently improve on its global standing in overall infrastructure supply \\nquality and in particular the electricity ac cess quality, compared to some of its competing countries, as \\nreflected in the Global Competitive Index (GCI) published by WEF.  \\nThe strategic framework for power sector: Two major performance gaps in the power sector are: (a) \\nincreasing cost of electricit y production and (b) continued operational deficits in the power sector. The \\nEighth Plan strategy needs to recognize these areas of concern and take adequate measures to correct them.  \\nSo, the stra tegic focus needs to not only having  a generation pipeline that will be meeting the demand, but \\nalso to ensure be tter quality and efficiency in (a) generation through ensuring optimal primary fuel mix, \\nincluding efforts to make increased use of domestic coal and gas through mining and exploration; (b) \\ntransmission  and distribution of electricity through further reduction of T&D losses; and (c) maximizing \\nuse of renewable energy and energy trade. The target will be to achieve an efficient least - cost production \\nin the long run, transmission, and distribution system.  These factors also played an important role during \\nthe 7FYP . So, the 8FYP  will broadly continue the strategy adopted during the 7FYP , but with focus in \\nbridging all identified gaps so that these are supportive of goals and strategies laid out in PSMP 2016  and \\nPP 2041.    \\n \\n363 \\n The 8FYP strategy comprises of following components:  \\n1. Move to an efficient least -cost power production structure based on (a) an optimal and efficient \\nprimary fuel mix; and (b) transmission, and distribution of electricity through further red uction of \\nT&D losses;  \\n2. Continue to enhance the generation capacity to match expansion of demand from all segments of \\nthe economy, particularly industry and manufacturing, so as to ensure supply of unhindered quality \\npower from the grid, with 100% populatio n connected to quality electricity supply.  \\n3. While moving to a least -cost power production system, have regular power tariff adjustments to \\nensure long term sustainability of power generation and moving away from budgetary subsidy that \\nis now prevalent.  \\n4. In order to leverage higher levels of investments, undertake necessary reforms that can create a \\nmore conducive and healthier environment for the participation of private sector (IPPs and PPPs), \\ndomestic and foreign, in energy sector development under the sup ervision of effective regulatory \\nauthority.  \\n5. Enhance the exploitation of gas, coal, renewable resources, increased energy imports particularly \\nhydropower from neighbouring  Bhutan and Nepal in order to optimize the energy mix and reduce \\nthe dependence on imp orted furnace oil and HSD. In this regard hydropower, given its abundance \\nin the neighbouring  countries and expected cheaper cost of production, will be given prime \\nimportance among other renewable resources. The other renewable resources include wind powe r, \\nsolar energy, biomass and waste to power, where the core strategic goal will be to make the energy \\navailable at optimum rate to all consumers.  \\n6. Address the identified issues including gas crisis, poor thermal power plant efficiency, and \\nadulteration in f urnace oil, fiscal prudence and sustainability.  \\n7. Improve Energy Efficiency & Conservation through demand side management . \\n8. Establishment of supply line network for the transportation of petroleum in quick, safe, efficient \\nand environment friendly way all ove r the country.  \\n9. Establishment of a number of energy hub s in the country including  Matarbari Ultra supercritical  \\nCoal -fired Power Plant  centric energy hub .  \\nGovernment had also set target to generate 10% of the total generation from renewable energy sources by \\n2021 with total electricity generation capacity now being over 23,548  MW (including captive and offgrid \\nrenewables ), and electricity coverage reaching 9 7% of the population with per capita generation increasing \\nto 51 2 kwh. The Government earlier through  its PSMP 2016set the stage to build on these achievements \\nand put in place a strategic plan under which power generation capacity target was set at 24000 MW by \\n2021, 40000 MW by 2030 and 60000 MW by 2041. A revised \"Power Generation Plan 2030\"  has now been \\nprepared from 2020 to 2030 considering PSMP -2016, progress during the 7FYP, Sustainable Development \\nGoals (SDG) and change of planning perspective of the power sector. The power generation targets for the \\n8FYP have been prepared based on the  revised Powe r Generation Plan up to 2030 . The  PSMP -2016 shall \\nsoon be updated by JICA considering demand, generation capacity, reserve margin etc.  \\n   \\n \\n364 \\n Move towards the strategy for achieving the least cost energy mix for generation during the 8th plan \\nperiod.  The effort during the 8FYP  will be in getting to a position of having an efficient fuel mix, following \\nguidelines of PSMP 2016, to bring more efficiency while reducing average cost of power generation, with \\nthe more efficient larger plants running while closing out t he less efficient plants, particularly the inefficient \\nliquid fuel rental plants and the small sized IPPs.  The choice of primary energy has a determining influence \\non the unit cost of electricity.  As shown in Table 5.1 5 below, the unit cost (Tk./ KWh ) for both Diesel and \\nFO stands way out; and any reduction in liquid fuel generation capacity will impact positively in re ducing \\nthe average unit cost.  The PSMP 2016 has proposed an optimum energy mix scenario by way of maximizing \\nwhat has been termed as the 3E  value (the total of the economic, environmental and energy security values) \\nof the power source composition of the energy mix.  Since least cost domestic power generation depends \\nupon choice of primary fuel, the success of least -cost power generation strat egy depends critically upon the \\navailability of primary fuel.  \\nTable 5.1 5: Unit Cost of Generation (Tk./per kWh)  \\nFuel Type in Generation  Unit Cost (Tk./KWH)  \\nFurnace Oil (FO)  17 \\nHSD  26 \\nLNG  13 \\nImported Coal  8.1 \\nDomestic Coal  6 \\nDomestic Gas  2.57 \\nHydro  1 \\nSolar Power Plant  12 \\nImported Power  6.48 \\nSource: Power Division  \\nBroadly speaking gas -based units and coal -fired plants tend to have much lower average unit cost of \\nproduction than those based on fuel oil (furnace oil and diesel). Imported power is al so a very attractive \\noption, which has been growing during the 7FYP , is expected to further increase during the 8FYP .  \\nThe PSMP 2016 strategic focus is the systematic expansion of relatively inexpensive large -scale coal power \\ngeneration and international c onnection with the neighbouring  countries as an exit strategy from the reliance \\non expensive oil -based rental power.  However, due to limitation of transmission capability among the \\nzones/regions, liquid fuel -based power plants continue need to be construc ted in deficit areas, which is \\ncostly and detrimental to the environment. It is of utmost necessity to enhance grid connectivity among the \\nzones/regions to get rid of such situation.  The plan also assumes nuclear -based power and optimizing of \\navailable ren ewable energy source in its power generation strategy. Renewable energy is increasingly \\nbecoming cheaper to produce and so should form important part of future fuel mix strategy.  \\nAnother strategic action that will be untaken during the 8th plan will be to  improve financial viability of all \\nthe power utilities through regular prices adjustments. All aspects of cost reductions including further \\nreduction in T&D system losses and achieving the strategic goal of least - cost power generation will help \\ncontain t he cost of power generation and power prices.   \\n   \\n \\n365 \\n Mobilizing adequate financial resources, both public and private though IPPs will be critical to achieving \\nthe strategic goals:  Timely access to adequate financing will be critical to achieve the power gener ation \\ntargets.  This will have to come from both public and the private sector. The success in mobilizing private \\nfinance for investments in the power sector through IPPs should be further leveraged. While under the 7th \\nPlan it had been expected that large r and efficient power plants will be built (particularly by the private \\nsector), this has not happened; and Bangladesh continues to have to keep the power supply services from \\nthe expensive rental plants at a high cost. During the 8th Plan period and beyon d focus would be to \\ncompletely move out of the rental plant contracts and also the inefficient small scale IPPs, and move the \\ndesired least -cost power production regime where efficiency and economy of the power plants will the only \\nconsideration. This will  also mean that there needs to be good competition in the bidding process so that \\nincentives can be built in for ensuring increased efficiency.   \\nPower Generation Program now under implementation and some to be completed during the Eighth \\nPlan Period : In order to meet future demand 44 new power plants have been under various stages of \\nconstruction with a total capacity of 15924  MW. Some of these will be completed during the Eighth Five \\nYear Plan . As presented in Table 5.1 6 below, 16 of these power plants ar e public sector with 9065 MW \\ncapacity, and 28 are in the private sector with 6,859 MW capacity. It is expected that most of these power \\nplants will go to power generation by 2023.  \\nTable 5.1 6: Power Generation Projects (Under Construction)  \\nSector  No. of Proj ects Capacity (MW)  \\nPublic Sector  16 9065  \\nPrivate Sector  28 6859  \\nTotal  44 15924  \\nSource: BER 2019  \\nProposed New Generation during the 8th Plan period:   \\nDuring the 8th Plan period, the Power Division plans to generate approximately additional 15,700  MW \\n(inclusive of imports but exclusive of renewable energy) of power. The Government has set in the following \\ntargets for the 8th Plan.  \\nTable 5. 17:  Power Generation Targets during 8th Plan  (including Captive and RE)  \\n  Baseline  \\n(FY20 20) Target \\n(2021)  Target \\n(2022) Target \\n(2023)  Target \\n(2024)  Target \\n(2025)  \\n       \\nInstalled Generation Capacity \\n(MW)  (including captive and RE)  23548  \\n 24000  26000  28000  29000  30000  \\nSource: Power Division  \\nNew projects with diversified fuel -mix identified for implementation during th e 8th plan period .  An \\nimportant feature of the power generation plan during the 8th Plan period the changing share of fuel mix \\nused for generation. While there will be numbers of gas -based plants, there are also large sized coal fired \\nplants both in the p ublic and private sector . The share of imported  coal will be increasing during the 8th \\nPlan period and that of liquid fuel declining, though it will still be at a substantial level. The share of gas,   \\n \\n366 \\n however, will continue to be the largest fuel source, wi th imported LNG being recently added to the system \\naugmenting gas - based power generation capacity. LNG, while is less costly than liquid fuel and also \\nrelatively cleaner source of energy, is still relatively expensive than domestic gas and coal .   \\nThe inc reased use of coal raises environmental challenges.  The government is very much aware of it taking \\nmeasures to ensure  environment rules and regulations are followed in case of power generation. In order to \\nminimize environmental impact and thereby reducin g carbon emission, coal -fired power plants will be \\nusing latest ultra-super  critical technology. In spite of minuscule contribution to GHG emissions, \\nconsidering significant impact of climate change to Bangladesh, Government has a strong commitment to \\nplay its part in reducing emission now and in the future.  \\nThe increased reliance on imported coal and LNG options also has challenges in terms of availability, \\ninvestment costs and domestic handling logistics. In order to derive the maximum cost advantage fro m coal, \\nit will be important to also start accessing the domestic coal base; though the most important constraint in \\nthis regard is the inability to adopt and implement a domestic coal policy. This period will also witness \\nincrease in import of electricit y from neighbouring countries. While, prospects for power trade are good, \\nbut there are also challenges as had earlier been discussed that will be factored in.  \\nNuclear Power: A major addition in fuel use will be nuclear power whose generation is expected t o start \\nby end of the 8th plan period. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is one of the top priority projects of the \\ngovernment. Considering geological, geophysical and meteorological data of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant \\nsite, the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commissi on (BAEC) has conducted feasibility studies. Meanwhile, \\nthe First Concrete Pouring (FCD) of Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the Rooppur plant have  been completed, with the \\nexpectation that the Unit 1 will be able to generate 1200 MW of power and the Unit 2 another 12 00 MW at \\na later date, adding a total of 2400 of nuclear power  by 2024 . There is also plan for adding 2,362 MW \\nrenewable energy, which is given in Table 5.18 below.  \\nTable 5.18:  Grid based Major Renewable Energy Projects  \\n \\nTarget  \\n(FY 2021)  Target  \\n(FY 2022)  Target  \\n(FY 2023)  Target \\n(FY 2024)  Target  \\n(FY 2025)  Total  \\nSolar  127 542 895 400 50 2,014  \\nWind   60 230  10 300 \\nWaste -to-Energy   6 42   48 \\nTotal  127 608 1,167  400 60 2,362  \\n \\nNeed for rationalizing power production to increase capacity usage. It is necessa ry for power sector \\nutilities to strategically maintain reserve margin, which would mean always having more power available \\nthan requirement so as to ensure system reliability. Having in place adequate reserve margin becomes a \\nnecessity because of the diff iculty of accurately forecasting future electricity demand, and also because \\nadding new generating capacity can take several years. However, there is also a negative side to it, as more \\nreserve margin will require huge amount of investment for not only for  constructing power plants, but also \\nfor paying capacity and other applicable charges. If it is too far off the actual demand,  then there is the large \\nopportunity cost arising from unused reserve margins.  So, reserve margin should be determined through \\nmeticulous demand forecast and financial analysis.    \\n \\n367 \\n It has already been shown in Section 5.2 above that over the years the actual generation has been \\nincreasingly falling short of the installed capacity. This has resulted in large sized capacity payments to \\nprivate power producers for not buying their power. This can have serious adverse financial implication on \\nPDB that could challenge the sectors long -term financial sustainability.  As an example, according to PDB \\nwebsite, while the actual day peak on 02/06/ 2020 was 9165 MW and the evening peak was 10,228 MW, \\nthat is averaging less than 10,000 MW, the power generation capacity was 19,570 MW (exclusive of captive \\nand RE power).  With inclusion of captive and RE the total installed capacity is 22,787 MW. This m eans \\nthat actual generation has been about 50% of installed capacity relative to the peak demand points. This \\ngap, which has been increasing between the years, as evident from Table 5.1, is likely to grow bigger with \\nsome large sized power plants nearing c ompletion. By 2021 the generation capacity has been projected to \\nincrease to 24,000 MW (Table 5. 17) and demand to 19,000 MW, given the present peak demand of around \\n10,000 MW.   \\nOne important area will be to look into the possibility of retirement and of t he higher cost and less efficient \\nrental and SIPP power plants, as well as any inefficient public sector power plants. The total rental, and \\nSIPP capacity is 1,754 MW, which could be actively considered for retirement. The government plans to \\nincrease capa city to 30,000  MW by end of 8th Plan period (Table 5. 17).  \\n8FYP for Renewable Energy: Climate change is a global problem due to high levels of greenhouse gas \\nemissions and almost every country in the world has moved away from conventional energy sources to  \\nencourage renewable energy based  power generation in order to find sustainable solutions. There is a \\ngeneral consensus around the world that there is no alternative to renewable energy - based power generation \\nto ensure long -term development.  \\nAccordingly, achieving a more sustainable energy program is a desired goal of the government and efforts \\nunderway to increase share of renewable energy (RE) in share of fuel mix during the 8th plan and beyond. \\nWith growing share of coal in generation, the exploitation of renewable energy resources with low \\nenvironmental burden will be needed  to help counter balance negative impacts from climate change \\nperspective.  The progress with implementation of RE, however, has been limited during the 7th Plan period. \\nThe governme nt has set an ambitious target of achieving 10% of total power generation capacity from \\nrenewable energy. This is an important target and a necessary of sustainable development. Strong efforts \\nwill be needed to secure this as the performance on RE was very  weak in the 7FYP.   \\nRegulatory and policy support for RE:  In this regard, the government has been taking different policy and \\nregulatory actions to facilitate scope for increased production of environment - friendly electricity from \\nrenewable energy. Besid es formulation of renewable energy policy in 2008 , the government had the \\n‘Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA)’ established in 2014 under \\nSustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority Act, 2012. One key strategic focus p roposed \\nunder the PP2041 strategy will be the encouragement of RE supply by private producers, including supply \\nto the grid as well as direct sales to households. SREDA has been facilitating and regulating private and \\npublic investments in renewable energy . There is a decision that the commercial RE projects were to be \\nimplemented by the private sector (IPPs), while social projects by the different ministries and agencies as \\na part of social responsibility of the Government.     \\n \\n368 \\n Some of the identified commerc ial projects that can be implemented by the private sector are: (a) Solar \\nPark (grid connected); (b) Solar Irrigation; (c) Solar Mini -grid/micro -grid; and (d) Solar rooftop.  The social \\nprojects are: (a) Rural health centres; (b) Remote educational institu tes; (c) Union e -Centres; (d) Remote \\nReligious Establishment; (e) Off -grid Railway Stations; and (f) Government and Semi -Government Offices \\nin the off -grid areas.  This will then be setting stage for a more visible shift to the active use of renewable \\nenergy and a concomitant reduction in the consumption of fossil fuel, following the global trend, with the \\naim of increasing the use of zero -emission power sources.  \\nThe solar housing schemes and solar irrigation supported by IDCOL are identified as important e xamples \\nof non -grid supply of renewable energy. At present, 649.51  MW of electricity is being generated from \\nrenewable sources. Furthermore, 543.08 MW renewable projects are under construction and 1416.41 MW \\nrenewable projects are under planning. For the 8th Plan period effort will be made to meet the target of \\n10%through IPPs for commercial projects. Bangladesh is currently preparing the competitive bidding by \\nIPPs, drafting FIT and providing other incentives (mainly financial ones) for renewable energy bu sinesses.  \\nAs Bangladesh increases the grid -connected renewable generation capacity, network and operation capacity \\nwill also need to be improved . \\nThere have also been initiatives by BPDB and through IPPs to increase renewable energy  generation, by \\nway of solar power projects, utility scale PV projects, and wind energy projects.   \\nWaste to Energy:   There is no alternative to science -based waste management in building every city \\ncorporation and major municipality of the country as a modern, healthy and livea ble city. Thus, BPDB has \\nundertaken the adoption/implementation of waste -to-energy (WTE) projects in various city corporations / \\nmajor municipalities in the IPP sector as a ground -breaking  step of the government for power generation \\nfrom waste with utmost importance on waste management. The waste -to-energy (WTE) project proposal \\nin Narayanganj City Corporation has already been approved by the government and the contract is in the \\nprocess of being signed.   Negotiation of WTE project under Dhaka North City Co rporation has been \\ncompleted and negotiation of WTE project under Dhaka South City Corporation is under process.  \\nPower Trade:  Use of power trade will continue to be a major element of the electricity generation strategy \\nfor the Eighth Plan. The potential for power trade between Bangladesh and its north -eastern neighbours is \\nlarge, and MOUs already exist in this regard. Bangladesh has already made encouraging beginning with \\npower trade with India.  Building on this experience, the Eighth Plan will further e xpand trade with India \\nand also explore hydropower import opportunities with Nepal and Bhutan.  \\nBangladesh is in a good position to exploit the ample regional hydropower potential and import it through \\nthe cross -border transmission network.  On -grid large -scale hydropower development can be an effective \\nmeasure to increase share of renewable energy source for power.  A JICA survey shows the cross -border \\nhydropower potential available to Bangladesh is 3,500 -8,500MWin 2030, mainly from Nepal and northeast \\nIndia. Thus, it is expected that Bangladesh import electricity out of such hydropower generation. A road \\nmap to increase and stabilize the imported power has been proposed in PSMP 2016, which will be \\nstrategically considered and implemented during the 8th Plan period.   There are, however, certain \\nchallenges/risks, linked to power import, and will need to be addressed, and risk -mitigating measures will \\nhave to be put in place.  In this context some of the measures suggested in the PSMP 2016 document will \\nbe co nsidered.    \\n \\n369 \\n Coordinating Transmission and Distribution Programmes with Generation: During the 8th Plan period \\nthe Government will continue to maintain proper coordination of investment in transmission and \\ndistribution to ensure that the benefits of generatio n investments reach the people.   Efforts will also \\ncontinue to further reduce distribution system losses from 9.35 % in FY2019 to below 7.5 % by FY2025. \\nTo this end, improvement of the quality of the power supply, such as stabilization of network voltage and \\nfrequency, is a prerequisite, and  so, large transmission and distribution development programmes will be \\nneeded to ensure uninterrupted power distribution and achieve the target of quality 24/7 power supply for \\nall. The operating voltages of the Bangla desh power network system are below 230kV and 132kV, except \\nfor the 500MW HVDC link to India that started operation in 2014 at Bheramara.  In the case of power \\ntransmission from hydropower stations located in Bhutan or Nepal through India, HVDC interconnec tions \\nwith a capacity of around 500 –2,000 MW will be required in the north western part of Bangladesh. PGCB \\nhas made major progress during the 7FYP  period in setting up of 400 kV HVDC Substation,  400/230/132 \\nkV station, 230/132 kV Substa tion, and 132/33 kV  Substation, s pecifically, up to 2025 about 3358  ct.km \\nof new transmission lines. Required projects have been taken by the concerned utilities.  \\nElectricity Transmission Plan:  Electricity demand of Bangladesh is growing very rapidly. For meeting \\ngrowing dem and, the Government is giving priority for transmission network development as well, and in \\nthis regard plans to construct 3358 ct.km.  This will include enhancing the transmission capacity from \\n132/230 kV to 400 kV, and about 1120 ckt km transmission line  to be constructed for it during FY 2021 -\\n25, for or maximum power transfer. Besides, it has been planned to construct new 700 ct.km transmission \\nline of capacity 765 kV from power hub being developed at Moheskhali to Dhaka, which will be completed \\nby 2025  \\nDistribution:  A reliable distribution network is critical to provide desired quality of power to the end -user \\n24/7.  It particularly is important for the manufacturing sector where sustained quality power supply from \\nthe grid can enhance productivity and competitiveness.  Industry in general and manufacturing sector in \\nparticular will be a key driving force in forward the growth agenda as set out under the PP 2041. An \\nintegrated power distribution programme will need to be undertaken to increase the distri bution network in \\norder to bring 100% population under electrification by 2020 as well as improving the customer service. \\nGovernment also wants to further reduce system loss and collect the outstanding bills, and provide 100% \\naccess to electricity to house holds.  \\nDistribution utilities are now implementing computer -based technologies to modernize their design, \\nplanning, and maintenance and analysis applications in an un -integrated way. DMS (Distribution \\nManagement System), GIS (Geographical Information Syste m) and SCADA (supervisory control and data \\nacquisition) are appearing at an increasing rate in the language of the power distribution community. GIS \\nintegration with SCADA/DMS system requires a considerable investment in software development for \\nsystem mod ernization and overcoming challenges. Additional business improvements would also be \\npossible with the real -time SCADA data available along with critical data maintained by GIS. At present, \\nall generation, transmission and distribution entities work separa tely to have GIS and SCADA, and it is \\nrecommended under PSMP 2016 the need to integrate all GIS and SCADA into single system and exchange \\ninformation in a coordinated way.  Moreover, it is further recommended to establish Smart Grid; for which, \\nGIS and SCA DA are the building blocks.  These can ensure uninterrupted and quality power supply to the \\ncustomers, as well as reduce system loss, pilferage and wastage. It is also recommended to convert the \\nwhole power system to Smart Grid. These are areas that will b e pursued under the 8th plan and beyond.    \\n \\n370 \\n To fulfil  the demand linked to the SDG goal 7 a number of distribution projects have been identified for \\nimplementation during the period FY 2021 -25, which include expansion of network, GIS implementation \\nand SCADA installation. Besides there are also 36,590 MVA substations and 955 MVAR capacitor banks  \\nfor reactive power compensation.  The total investment estimated by Power Division for this is Taka 1150 \\nbillion during FY 2021 -2025.  \\nRural electricity access and serv ice delivery being improved: In order to achieve 100 per cent  \\nelectrification, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) has been investing in development, \\nexpansion and up -gradation of existing distribution system to help achieve 100% access to electr icity.  As \\npart of it, BREB has taken three projects on system up -gradation, one project for pre -payment e -metering, \\none project for overloaded transformer replacement, and another ten for Line Construction and Consumer \\nConnection. These projects besides c onstructing/renovating 38,379 km new distribution line, and \\nconstruction/ augmentation of 198 sub -stations, will help connect 21.4 lakh different category consumers \\nand install 10 lakh pre -paid meters under rural electrification category.  \\nImproving Operati onal Efficiency of Generation Plants:  \\nEven though the 7FYP had laid emphasis, efficient operation and maintenance (O&M) of the running power \\nplants continues to be a critical challenge. As pointed out in the PP2041, for a range of reasons, actual \\ninstalle d capacity has been higher than maximum power produced in any year. It is well recognized that for \\nefficiently managed utilities excess capacity would be about 20%. In Bangladesh, this is now more than \\n33%, which is on the high side.  This has impact of ne cessity of higher investment costs and higher average \\nelectricity prices. This larger gap between installed capacity and capacity required to produce maximum \\npower in any year is explained by shortages in the availability of primary fuel, particularly gas,  difficulties \\nin coordinating maintenance schedule and other operating obstacles. The PP2041 has sought to address \\nthese concerns by improving operating practices in terms of timely availability of primary fuel, efficient \\nmaintenance practices and better m anagement. The objective of PP 2041 would be to reduce the gap to 70% \\nby FY2031 and to 80% by FY2041, so as to help lower the investment cost of power generation and the \\naverage electricity prices. During the 8FYP this PP2041 strategy  will be implemented a nd a key target will \\nbe to improve the efficiency of the power plants with increased focus on O&M. Adoption and \\nimplementation of a proper O&M will continue to be of highest priority.  \\nThe Government recognizes that a unit of saving is easier than one unit of electricity production, and several \\nnew policies have been adopted to conserve power and improve the operational efficiency of the power \\nsector.  It has also undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure efficient use of energy, which will get \\nimplemente d during the 8FYP. As part of meeting this objective, the Government has set the target of \\nsaving l5% of total energy consumption by 2021. Government has prepared Energy Efficiency & \\nConservation Master Plans up to 2030, Energy Efficiency & Conservation Ru les 2016, Energy Audit \\nRegulation 2018 and Action Plan to ensure Energy Efficiency & Conservation both at supply & demand \\nside.  \\nImproving Procurement: In the coming years there will be need to increase commissioning of larger sized \\npower plants to help ac hieve the massive generation expansion strategy now under implementation, and to \\nhelp bring efficiency and reduction costs of generation. So, efficient procurement decisions will be critical \\nto ensuring timely implementation of new electricity investments,  and the power  utilities will need to   \\n \\n371 \\n acquire the capability to timely and efficiently implement large power plant contracts. Rapid conclusion of \\nprocurement/contracting can help leverage cheaper and more efficient financing and bringing in large \\ninvestmen ts for both public and private sector implemented power projects.  Having in place an institutional \\nset up with a transparent and efficient procurement system is a sensitive issue for getting cheaper finance \\nfrom multilateral donor sources.  It is also equ ally important to get more competitive bids for IPPs.  These \\nwill lead to building up power generation capacity based on efficiency and least cost considerations.  \\nCapacities need to be strengthened to negotiate and monitor implementation of energy trade c ontracts with \\nneighbours. Regional opportunities should be explored intensely to secure the energy requirement of the \\neconomy. Hydro -electricity of Bhutan and Nepal can be imported by Bangladesh. Bangladesh can invest \\nin the power sectors of Nepal and Bhut an and arrange trans -border electricity trade.  \\nPricing Policies and Cost Recovery:  Sound energy pricing policy is essential to ensure efficient use of \\nthis expensive and critical resource, to finance public investment, provide high -quality service to \\nconsumers, to promote private investment, and to ensure environmental protection. The establishment and \\nfunctioning of the BERC has been a major positive institutional reform that has tended to depoliticize \\nelectricity pricing.  This has been helpful in period ic price adjustments based on cost.  In the absence of \\ncompetition, cost -based pricing is not always efficient.  During the 8FYP  some large coal fired plants as \\nwell as gas fired through imported LNG are expected to be on line, which could have impact on r educing \\ncosts. Even so, the average cost can be expected to rise being impacted by price volatility from imported \\nLNG and imported coal, unless exploration and mining for increasing domestic gas and coal supply is made. \\nIt will be important to enable the p ower sector to be financially sustainable and earn a reasonable rate of \\nreturn on assets, so as to finance the huge investments that will be required.  To achieve this objective, \\npower prices will have to be set in ways that enables enterprises to recover the cost of production and earn \\na reasonable rate of return on assets. The strategy to produce power on the least cost option basis noted \\nabove in terms of technology, the scale of operation and choice of fuel could ensure that this pricing policy \\nis effic ient and protects consumer interests.  As a means for reducing carbon emission , the importance of \\nproper energy pricing policy for environmental protection cannot be over -emphasized; and proper pricing \\nand taxing can encourage the adoption of clean technol ogy and investments in renewable energy.  \\nDemand -side management (DSM) , is being actively pursued by power s ector as a means for modifying \\nenergy use to maximize energy efficiency, so as to get maximum benefit out of existing energy generation. \\nDSM involve s changing energy use habits of consumers and encouraging them for using energy efficient \\nappliances, equipment etc. at their premises, and the cost savings in terms of investment in new capacity \\nwould be much higher than the cost of implementing the DSM.  The Government, on its part, will continue \\nits emphasis on energy conservation by working on both supply and demand sides.  In the area of demand \\nmanagement, proper pricing of electricity will also help conserve power. More broadly, a well -articulated \\ndemand side management (DSM) policy can also be an extremely cost -effective way of curtailing peak \\ndemand, and effectively control load shedding.  \\nIn this context, SREDA, which has been set up to support bring efficiency in the energy sector, has been \\nentrust ed with following major responsibilities: (1) Energy Management program, which includes (i) \\ncertification mechanism of Energy Manager and Energy Auditor, and (ii) designation of large energy \\nconsumers in industry and building sectors, those who are obligat ed to appoint/ nominate energy managers, \\nimplement the energy management for energy saving, prepare and submit annual energy reports and   \\n \\n372 \\n improvement plan to SREDA, and implement the energy audit periodically;  (2) Energy Efficiency \\nLabelling Program, which intends to promote sales of high efficiency products in the market, mainly home \\nappliances such as room air -conditioner, refrigerator/ freezer, TV, motors, lighting, and fan, through \\nofficially certified star rating labels on them; (3) Energy Efficiency Bu ilding Program which intends to \\npromote energy efficiency in public and private buildings; (4) Awareness raising program that intends to \\ninduce behavioural  change among people so that they are motivated to save energy and hence build an \\nenergy conscious na tion. \\nFull implementation would require clear incentive and promotional mechanisms. A range of incentives has \\nbeen proposed including preferential taxation, subsidy and low -interest financing. Concerted efforts will be \\nneeded to make SREDA fully functional  with a clear mandate to implement the Government’s energy \\nconservation strategy.  \\n5.3.2  The Strategy for Primary Energy Sector  \\nSupply of Primary Energy  \\nIn recognition of the energy challenges faced by the country, the Bangladeshi Government had set out a \\nNational Energy Policy (NEP) in 2005. A revision was issued in 2008 adding a particular focus on \\nrenewable energy. Currently, there are no further updates on the NEP. The 7th Five Year Plan had \\nrecommended formulation and implementation of specific gas sec tor policies, as Bangladesh continues to \\nface growing shortage in domestically produced primary energy with resultant increased reliance on higher \\ncost imported LNG and imported coal. Therefore, the most important strategic issue facing relating to \\nenergy in the Eighth Plan, as had been during the Seventh plan, is achieving efficient supply of primary \\nenergy.  A judicious combination of choices relating to domestic supply options and import options will \\nneed to be made to ensure the efficient and cost -effec tive supply of primary energy.  The other strategic \\nissue that government wants to pursue is increasing access to the citizens the chance to get access to cleaner \\nfuels. The strategic target of the government is to try and achieve increase in proportion of population with \\nprimary reliance on clean fuels and technology from 19% in FY 2019 to 30% by FY 2025.  \\nGas Sector Policy  \\nBangladesh has now adopted the “Gas Sector Master Plan Bangladesh 2017 (Final Report February 2018)”, \\nwhich along with the PSMP 2016 cre ates a good analytical base for developing the energy sector as a whole \\nincluding adopting necessary policies, regulatory interventions and investment needs to develop the gas \\nsector.  However, there is yet no clearly defined gas sector policy in Banglades h.  The 7th Plan had identified \\nthe following policy actions that are needed  in the primary energy sector: i) Gas Allocation Policy, ii) \\nDomestic gas exploration policy, (iii) Domestic coal utilization; iv) Energy import  v) Demand side \\nmanagement and energ y conservation, vi) Improved Cooking Stove (ICS); and vii) Energy subsidy and \\npricing. These need to be pursued during the 8th plan period.  \\ni) Gas Allocation Policy: During the 8th plan period the Government will be encouraged to adopt a gas \\nallocation pol icy in line with what had been proposed under the 7th plan, so as to  best utilize the limited \\ndomestic reserve. The gas allocation policy should direct allocation for more energy -efficient users even \\nwithin one sector, so as to help reduce unit costs.  Part of this policy should be on ways and means for \\ndisseminating gas prepaid meter and LPG. The policy should help promoting and incentivizing replacement   \\n \\n373 \\n of domestic use and CNG by increased use of LPG; for which energy tariff (gas and LPG) reform should \\nsimultaneously be applied.  The tariff reforms should help adjust  prices in a way to help minimize the \\ndifference between LPG and pipelined gas tariffs. Currently, LPG users are facing a more than 9 times \\nhigher tariff (at per calorific value) than that of p ipelined domestic gas, where one 12.5 kg cylinder costs at \\n1200BDT. In addition to LPG, the use of Biogas will have to be incentivized through the gas use policy as \\nthe alternative of pipeline natural gas. Similarly, to the LPG utilization policy, Biogas u tilization policy \\nmay also define how Primary Energy, namely pipeline gas, LPG and Biogas can be best mixed.  \\nii) Domestic Gas Exploration Policy: Bangladesh still has untapped gas resources, while import of LNG \\nincreases to ensure smooth supply of natural gas. Two LNG FSRU terminals (Excelerate and Summit) are \\nnow in operation with a nameplate capacity of 500MMCFD for each terminal.  The cost of exploration and \\ndevelopment of untapped resource is likely to be lower than the cost of LNG import. Therefore, Ba ngladesh \\nwill need to focus on investment for exploration and development.  Furthermore, in order to implement \\nexploration and development of undiscovered resources, external resources may be required. The untapped \\nresource is likely to lie in coastal/tran sitional areas, hill tract areas or in the offshore areas, which will \\nrequire  high technology and huge capital. To address such technical and financial issues, Joint Venture or \\n“Strategic Partnership” between BAPEX and foreign companies may be sought or Pr oduction Sharing \\nAgreement with IOCs. With the delineation of maritime boundaries with Myanmar and India, a new \\nopportunity has opened up for offshore exploration. Therefore, both onshore and offshore oil and gas \\noptions could be pursued.  \\niii) Domestic Co al Utilization: Bangladesh is endowed with rich bituminous coal deposit, with the \\nmeasured and probable coal reserves total of 7,962  million tons. Out of five identified coal fields, namely \\nBarapukuria, Phulbari, Khalaspir, Dighipara and Jamalganj, only Ba rapukuria is currently in production. \\nBarapukuria’s measured and probable reserve is 390 million tons. This mine has capacity to produce one \\nmillion tons per year. Coal produced from Barapukuria has good heating value, more than 6,072kcal/kg \\n(25.68MJ/kg). This level of quality coal can be used for coking coal. Currently, the Barapukuria coal is \\nfuelled  for the mine -mouth Barapukuria Coal Power Generation and brick kilns. However, with such good \\nheating value, Barapukuria coal could be used for higher energy  efficient use, such as higher efficient coal -\\nfired power plant (Super -critical or Ultra Super Critical) power plant, or for more energy -intensive industry \\nuse such as steel production (coking coal). As proposed in 7th plan, it is important to explore the scope of \\nexporting the high quality Barapukuria coal as higher valued coking coal or steam coal, and import lesser \\nquality coal for Barapukuria Coal Power Generation. Such utilization would contribute to the higher value -\\nadded economic activities, and shou ld be directed by the articulated Domestic Coal Utilization Policy, as \\nhad been proposed in the 7th plan.  \\niv) Energy Import  \\n(a) Import LNG/Gas pipeline: Bangladesh’s need to import LNG will continue to increase. As already \\nproposed under the 7th plan, in o rder to mitigate the very high unit price and to have bargaining power, it \\nwill be critical for Bangladesh to take various measures, such as diversification of gas suppliers, and co -\\npurchasing of natural gas with other countries. In particular, Bangladesh may pursue alternate sources and \\nscope of supply in addition to the current sources. In order to obtain extra buying power, a possible process \\ncould be co -purchasing with India or other South Asian countries could be sought; and periodic contract \\nreview to  seek more favourable  conditions of a contract, while domestic resource development is actively \\npursued.    \\n \\n374 \\n (b) Import Coal: The Government has launched its program to change power mix ratios and rapidly \\ndevelop coal -fired power plants. Given the present sta tus of domestic coal, the implementation of these \\nprojects will require imported coal for fuel. This will require huge port, rail transport and coal stocking \\ninfrastructure. However, so far there is only one on-going  deep -sea port project in Matarbari Isla nd, which \\nwill be able to cater ships having 80,000 -ton capacity. This is currently dedicated for Matarbari Ultra Super \\nCritical Coal -fired Power Plant. In the near future, however, the Government intends to expand this deep -\\nsea port and develop a coal Cen tre as “An Energy Hub”.  \\nv) Demand Side Management (DSM) and Energy Conservation.  In view of the severe gas constraint \\nand its high value to the Bangladesh economy, a strong effort is needed to conserve gas use in Bangladesh. \\nEnergy efficiency and conserva tion has been recognized as an urgent policy priority under the 7th Five Year \\nPlan. The policy effort involves substitution of low thermal efficient gas -fired power plants with more \\nenergy efficient plants; incentives for adoption of improved fuel use effi ciency and energy conservation \\ntechnology in industry; and conserving gas consumption by households through proper metering and \\npricing based on volume of gas consumed rather than a monthly flat rate per stove. The potential for \\nconserving gas through thes e steps is enormous and the value of gas saved much exceeds the financial cost \\nof implementing these policies.  \\nvi) Improved Cooking Stove (ICS).  The 7th plan strongly recommended in making use of the “Improved \\nCooking Stove (ICS)” among the population by providing appropriate financial incentives removing of \\nimpediments through proper regulatory schemes.  The impediments include tax barriers and access to loan, \\nwhich are quite similar to what were experienced in Solar Home Systems (SHS) dissemination in \\nBangladesh. During the 8th plan the on-going  efforts of the 7th plan will continue with increased focus on \\nimplementation of financial incentives and regulatory schemes.   \\nvii) Energy Subsidy and Pricing: As already witnessed during the 7th plan, between FY20 21 to FY2025, \\nthe energy import will further increase, mainly because of LNG, coal and oil import for power generation. \\nAs a result, energy costs can be expected to grow at a fast pace. Therefore, the Government needs to \\ndetermine the extent to which Energ y Subsidy could be allowed in high priority sectors that also maintains \\nbudgetary discipline. The subsidy policy will need to be coordinated with pricing of energy products both \\nfor fiscal sustainability but also to promote efficient energy use in total as  well as by product categories.   \\n5.3.3  Financing Strategy for Power and Primary Energy  \\nThe investment requirements for power generation alone will be overwhelming; and when the costs of \\ntransmission and distribution are added, they present a major financ ing challenge. Total required power \\nsector investments would add up to 2% of GDP per year during the Eighth Plan period. Even after allowing \\nfor a substantial contribution of private power investment and power imports, the public power sector \\ninvestment re quirements will be about 1.2% of GDP per year on average.  Investments in primary energy \\n(oil and gas exploration and development) will be funded by foreign investments and public investments in \\nprimary energy will be modest. Total public investment in ene rgy (power plus primary energy) will be \\nabout 1.4% of GDP per year on average.  \\nGiven these large financing requirements and the multiple claims on the budget, especially the need to \\ninvest in health sector and social protection in response to COVID -19, a s ound financing strategy for the \\nenergy sector is essential. This will be a combination of PPP financing for power generation plus measures \\nto contain energy subsidies.  The Eighth Plan assumes that the subsidy on power will be reduced gradually .    \\n \\n375 \\n For prima ry energy, the Eighth Plan assumes that the level of subsidy will be capped at around 0.2% of \\nGDP throughout  the plan period.  The subsidy will be targeted to the poor and for supporting the expansion \\nof renewable energy programmes.  This will require that  energy prices are managed properly in line with \\nlong-term trends in primary fuel oil.  In power the Government will ensure that the average price of \\nelectricity must be at least equal to the average cost of production.  \\n5.3.4  Institutional Reforms in the  Power Sector  \\nPast reforms have yielded good dividends.  Nevertheless, there are several areas where further efforts are \\nneeded.  These include: continue unbundling along the functional line, carry out corporatization of \\ngeneration and distribution, streng then generation and distribution companies already in place to improve \\noperating performance and customer satisfaction, implement the power sector restructuring plan; upgrade \\nelectricity price gradually to cost level and strengthen BERC to be able to perfo rm its agenda on licensing, \\nenergy pricing, quality of utility performance including energy efficiency, and consumer \\nsatisfaction/dispute resolution. The challenge is particularly serious in the area of planning and \\nimplementing new generation capacities  \\nIn the area of generation , although there is a power generation expansion strategy (PSMP2010), which is \\nunder implementation since 2011, there is a need to revisit the PSMP 2016 and that plan to check for \\nrelevance in light of implementation experience of t he past 4 years and the realism of the generation plan \\nin the context of realities in the primary energy sector. The PSMP 2016 needs to be revised in light of the \\nexperience during the 7th plan period and also to account possible changes in demand situatio n, particularly \\nin the aftermath of COVID shock and also any uncertainties in the supply side of primary energy.  Based \\non the findings contingent planning is necessary to have back -up power generation plans that respond to \\nthese uncertainties.     \\nSeveral  new policies have been adopted to conserve power and improve the operational efficiency of the \\npower sector. In this regard, the proper implementation of SREDA will be a major institutional challenge.   \\nThe power sector needs to be run and managed as a co mmercial enterprise and not as a typical state -owned \\nenterprise. As reliance on inefficient high -cost rental power plants fall, the finances of power sector will \\nfurther improve.  Yet, the challenge of generating a surplus in the power sector will require substantial \\nimprovement in financial management capabilities of the power sector.  Over time the cost of electricity \\nwill go up. While the de -politicization of power pricing through the BERC has been a positive step forward, \\nthe ability to justify continuo us increases in power prices without appropriate improvement of service \\nstandards and a positive interface with consumers will challenge the power sector and the government.  \\nThere is a lot of effort that is needed in the area of public interface and consu mer service. Ensuring \\nuninterrupted power service and responding to consumer issues with service quality, billing and payments \\nrequires substantial additional effort.  \\nLegal framework related reforms : Amendment to the Electricity related Acts could be unde rtaken \\nregarding several kinds of obligation rules and their penal provisions in order to enhance effectiveness, and \\nthus help with improvement in customer service and ensuring regular quality supply of electricity to end \\nusers. There are challenges to ens uring to suspending operations of power generation facilities and inspect \\nthem regularly. This had been acute when there had been shortage of power supply, and the legal framework   \\n \\n376 \\n for the preventive maintenance and O&M of these facilities has been insuffic ient. Because of these reasons, \\nthe power generation facilities are not operating at their design performance level (in terms of power output, \\nthermal efficiency, etc.). Since periodic inspection is not stipulated by law in Bangladesh, these tend to be \\npostponed due to reasons such as budget shortages or tight electricity demand, thus resulting in unplanned \\nand undesirable shutdown. So, there is necessity of institutionalization of periodic inspections . There is also \\nnecessity of institutionalization of tec hnical standards, so as to regulate and help reduce the amount of \\naccidental trouble and disasters. So, there should still be in place an O&M Legal Framework to ensure that \\nthis is achieved.  \\nEffective coordination mechanism to synchronize power and primar y energy needs.  There is also an \\nurgent need to consider putting in place a new institutional structure that can comprehensively reflect the \\nprimary energy needs to support power development plan that synchronizes effectively with the energy \\nsupply plan in  a dynamic way.  The power sector and primary energy sector related plan and strategies are \\nresponsibility of the Power Division and the Energy and Mineral Resource Division under MoPEMR. \\nHowever, there is no organizational structure that supervises the ov erall energy supply and demand in \\nBangladesh comprehensively.  As the domestic production of natural gas in Bangladeshis expected to \\ndeplete whereas the energy demand will continue to increase rapidly, the country will need to depend more \\non imported energ y sources.  Considering this situation, the importance of developing an energy supply \\nplan from a comprehensive viewpoint can be expected to gain importance for determining how to \\nappropriate the limited domestic energy production among various sectors and  which energy sources to \\nimport for supplying to which sector and in what quantity. These power development plan and energy \\nsupply plan in future will have to be better coordinated and synchronized and updated regularly by reflecting \\nthe conditional change s. Therefore, establishing an institutional framework is necessary to develop and \\nimplement both plans comprehensively by involving all the relevant stakeholders for these plans to share \\ninformation.  \\nNeed for strengthening data management of the energy sec tor to support evidence -based policy making.  \\nIn order to have better access to data for overall energy policy making it has been suggested by a JICA \\nStudy team the need for establishment of what could be termed as “Integrated Statistics Bureau” in \\nMoPEMR f or the centralized management of all the data from the organizations under the jurisdiction of \\nthe Power Division and the Energy Division with the need to revise the power and energy master plan \\nperiodically taken into consideration. For example, there is no energy related exclusive government agency \\nresponsible for catching data how each sector (residential, commercial, industrial, transport etc.) utilizes \\nenergy as the combination of various sources of energy supply such as electricity, natural gas, LPG, oil \\nproducts, non -commercial fuel (bio fuel) etc. So, when there is shortage of gas creeping up and demand for \\nit is increasing, there is tendency to try and adjust the gap by ad -hoc decisions like restricting new supply \\nof natural gas to residential secto r and transport sector, and instead inducing these sectors to use LPG \\ninstead. However, if this idea is actually implemented without long -term perspective of energy supply and \\ndemand, it may result in the rapid increase of LPG procurement that is apt to be  costlier than LNG, and the \\nburden of nationwide energy cost may become heavier. In order to realize the long -term optimization of \\nnationwide energy balances, GoB needs to strengthen the function to consider and coordinate the national \\nenergy policy compre hensively. This can be done if there is centralized management of all the data from \\nthe organizations under the jurisdiction of the Power Division and the EMRD.    \\n \\n377 \\n 5.3.5  Institutional Reforms in Energy  \\nThe challenges in the energy sector are substantial. The  successful implementation of an efficient power \\ngeneration strategy is critically dependent upon the implementation of these reforms relating to primary \\nenergy. The growing reliance on imported primary energy requires strong skills and knowledge about glo bal \\nenergy markets and future outlook in order to negotiate the best prices and assured timely supply of primary \\nenergy. There will be need for improvements in the technical and negotiation capacity of the Ministry and \\nassociated energy agencies.  Administ rative and technical capacities also need to expand in a number of  \\nareas related to domestic gas exploration, negotiation of IOC investments, development and implementation \\nof renewable energy programmes  and the implementation of DSM initiatives. The imple mentation of DSM \\ninitiatives will require proper dialogue and coordination with the industry and transport sector.  \\nThe financial requirements in primary energy are huge. PPP programmes  can be a major source of such \\nfinancing, any business environment type bottlenecks that impacts slow off take of PPP projects will have \\nto be overcome.  \\n5.3.6  Annual Development Plan Allocations for Energy Sector during the Eighth Plan  \\nThe ADP allocations for the energy sector in constant (2020/21 prices) and curre nt prices a re shown in \\nTable 5.19  and Table 5.2 0. Consistent with the allocations in the 6th and the 7th plan and in view of GDP \\ngrowth acceleration that requires considerable power and energy investments, the ADP provides substantial \\nand growing allocations for powe r and energy in both current and constant prices. The allocations also \\nassume continued progress with mobilizing IPPs in the power sector and greater mobilization of FDI in the \\nenergy sector.   \\nTable 5.19 : Eighth Plan ADP Allocations for Power and Energy S ector  \\n(Taka billion current prices)  \\nMinistry  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nEnergy and Mineral Resources Division  20.0 24.7 28.4 33.2 39.8 \\nPower Division  245.1 264.5  362.4 419.0  502.8  \\nTotal  265.1  289.2  390.8  452.2  542.6  \\n Source: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Tab le A5.1  \\nTable 5.2 0: Eighth Plan ADP Allocations for Power & Energy Sector  \\n(Taka billion FY2021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24  FY25  \\nEnergy and Mineral Resources Division  20.0 23.4 25.7 28.6 32.7 \\nPower Division  245.1 251.0  327.4 360.7  413.2  \\nTotal  265.1  274.4  353.1 389.3  445.9  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2  \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 6:  \\nTRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS  \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n381 \\n CHAPTER 6 \\nTRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION  \\nDEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  \\n6.1  OVERVIEW  \\nIn today\\'s globalized economy, low -cost an d efficient transport service is a major determinant of the \\ncompetitiveness of the economy that influences trade and investment flows both internally within a country \\nand externally.  Efficient transport system also impacts on the pattern of regional develo pment within a country \\nand the location of poverty. Development of an efficient and low -cost transport network is, therefore, a key \\ndeterminant of the ability to achieve the growth and poverty targets  of PP2041.  \\nRecognizing the important role of transport , Bangladesh has put top priority to the development of its transport \\nnetwork. Bangladesh witnessed rapid growth of transport sector since independence. The overall annual growth \\nrate was nearly 8.2 per cent  for freight transport and 8.4 per cent  for passe nger transport. Even so, the demand \\nfor transport services continues to grow very fast, especially as the economy gets internally integrated and \\neconomic transformation away from agriculture and rural economy to urban -based industrial and modern \\nservices g athers speed.  The relative roles of transport modes are evolving with road transport continuing \\nexpanding to dominate because of its inherent technical and cost advantages.  \\nTransport system in Bangladesh comprises a number of distinct modes and services,  notably railways, \\nroads, road transport, land ports, inland water transport, coastal shipping, airports and airlines. Roads and \\ninland water transport are the dominant means of transport carrying more than 90% of total traffic generated \\nin the country. Al though other modes like railway, coastal shipping would play a greater role, roads and \\nIWT would continue to dominate the transport landscape in the foreseeable future. Presently there are about \\n55,000kms of paved roads; 2,877 route -kilometres  of railways,  3,800 km of perennial waterways which \\nincreases to about 6,000 km during the monsoon, 2 seaports, 3  international airports (i.e. Dhaka, Chittagong  \\nand Sylhet) and 8 domestic airports.  \\nPublic sector is mainly responsible for development and maintenance of transport infrastructure in Bangladesh. \\nThe public sector is involved in transport operations in road, railways, inland water transport (IWT) and ocean \\nshipping alongside the private sector. In the road transport and IWT sub -sectors, the private sector is dominant. \\nIn ocean shipping, however, public sector still predominates, although the private sector has considerably \\nincreased its role in recent years. Recently private sector has also become important operator in air transport, \\nboth domestic and internat ional. Involvement of the private sector in railway operation, however, is very \\nlimited.  \\n6.2  TRANSPORT SECTOR PROGRESS UNDER THE 7FYP  \\nGDP growth targets of the 7FYP and goals of improved living standards called for a vibrant and effective \\ntransport network. S ecuring improvement in the transport system was, therefore, a major strategic objective of \\nthe 7FYP. The transport sector vision for the 7FYP was to develop an efficient, sustainable, safe and \\nregionally balanced transportation system in which various mode s complement each other, interface   \\n \\n382 \\n appropriately and, where possible, provide healthy competition to each other. Special emphasis was placed \\non the i ntroduction of modern technology for increasing capacity and improving quality and productivity of \\nthe syst em, development of the two seaports with smooth transport links to Dhaka, establishment of effective \\nrailway linkages between the east and west zones of the country, integration of road, rail and inland water \\ntransport, and participation in global and regi onal transport connectivity initiatives that help  to develop the \\nland route links between South Asia and East Asia through Bangladesh.  \\nOn the investment side, a conscious decision was taken to prioritize transformational transport infrastructure \\nprojects  that helps modernize the Bangladesh transport network so as to improve the mobility of goods and \\nservices across the nation, facilitate international trade, reduce cost and improve competitiveness. These \\ntransformational projects are highly capital intens ive, are multi -year in nature, and require strong supervision \\nto avoid cost over -runs and delays. Recognizing the special challenge posed by growing urbanization and urban \\ntraffic congestion, the 7FYP sought to introduce Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) starting w ith the capital city Dhaka  \\nand its adjoining , with a targeted completion of MRT Line -6 (the first elevated Metro Rail of Bangladesh) in \\nDecember 2022 . Mindful of the resource constraints and high investment costs, the 7FYP strategy was to \\ncombine ADP alloc ations with a strong public -private -partnership (PPP) effort.  The plan also intended to \\nimprove the inter -modal transport balance with greater emphasis on rail and inland waterways that are low -\\ncost in nature and are environmentally friendly compared to o ther mode of transport. The  importance of \\ntransport, especially air transport, for tourism was recognized with a focus on improving inter -district airline \\nconnectivity. Efforts  were also to be made to improve resource mobilization through the introduction of user \\ncharges and fees for a range of public transport services including road user charges, port fees, inland water \\nand rail fares.  \\nThe objectives and strategies of the 7FYP for the transport sector were sound. The emphasis on intermodal \\ntransport coord ination, development of the national highways, inter -city connectivity, regional \\nconnectivity, lowering the cost of trade logistics and improving transport network asset maintenance are all \\nwell placed. The idea of instituting road user charges and sensiti vity to environmental sustainability is also \\nappropriate.  Similarly, the strategy to improve incentives for private sector participation in both transport \\nsector service and infrastructure development is well placed.  \\nConsistent with the 7FYP strategy, the  transport sector received high priority in budget allocation. The ADP  \\nallocated resources for all major projects in line with the 7FYP strategy and priority. Significant  new \\ntransport infrastructure has been added over the plan period for roads and bridge s. Services have expanded \\nfor all modes of transport. Private participation in air transport has grown significantly and most large cities \\nare now connected with air services.  These are major achievements that laid a strong foundation for \\nconsolidation un der the 8FYP.   \\n6.2.1  Progress with Road Transport  \\nA good road network is a critical infrastructure requirement for rapid growth. It provides connectivity to \\nremote areas; provides accessibility to markets, schools, and hospitals; and opens up backward re gions to \\ntrade and investment.  \\n   \\n \\n383 \\n Highways and district roads:  The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) is solely responsible for the \\ndevelopment, maintenance and management of arterial highway network in the country with a vision to \\nprovide seamless mobilit y through building sustainable, safe & quality road infrastructure and integrated \\nmodern transport system for achieving desired socio -economic development. A well -planned and \\nsustainable road transport system has already played a unique role to achieve the  government target set for \\nVision 2021. Presently, RHD manages about 21596 km of roads out of which 18% per cent  is national \\nhighway, 20% is regional highway, and 62% is zi la highways (Table 6.1). The roads expansion program \\nduring the 6FYP and the 7FYP wa s guided by the Road Master Plan 2010 -2030. The focus of RHD program \\nin the 7FYP was less on expansion of total road network length and more on enabling better traffic mobility \\non heavily used inter -city road corridors. Thus, the emphasis was to increase t he capacity of heavily \\ntrafficked roads by widening them to four lane/six lane along with service road for local traffic. This was a \\nsound strategy aimed at maximizing the benefits and better use of the road network.  Progress with \\ncompletion of major Road Sector Mega Projects is shown in Box 6.1.  \\nTable 6.1: Various Categories of Roads under RHD (in km)  \\nYear  National Highway  Regional Highway  Zila Road  Total  \\n2016  3813  4247  13242  21302  \\n2017  3813  4247  13242  21302  \\n2018  3813  4247  13242  21302  \\n2019  3906  4281  13207  21596  \\n2020  3944  4883  13536  22363  \\nSource: www.rhd.gov.bd  \\n Box 6.1:  Progress on Mega Projects under RHD  \\n\\uf0b7 Four laning of Dhaka -Chittagong road, Dhaka -Mymensingh road, and Dhaka Mawa Expressway is complete.  \\n\\uf0b7 Dhaka -Tangail 4 lane Highway expected to be completed in 2021.  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on Elenga -Rangpur road network underway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on  Dhaka -Sylhet road has not started yet.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrading of the Madanpur -Joydevpur road to 4 - lane through PPP underway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Dhaka -Chittagong expressway feasibility study completed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on the Hatirjheel -Demra Expressway underway  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on the Gabtoli -Nabinagar Expres sway underway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrading into 4 -Lane of Ashuganj River Port -Akhaura Landport Highway; Feni -Noakhali National \\nHighway; and Comilla -Noakhali Highway underway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of 4 -Lane Payra Bridge over the river P ayra on Barisal -Patuakhali National Highway \\nunderway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on 17 Bridges including Kalna Bridge under Cross Border Road Network Improvement Project underway.  \\n\\uf0b7  82 Bridges under Bangladesh Bridge Improvement Project underway.  \\n\\uf0b7 Work on 317 -kilometer border road in the Hill Tracts districts of Bandarban, Ra ngamati and Khagrachari \\nis underway  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of Itna -Mithamoin -Ashtogram Road Project is completed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Highway (Sylhet -Bholaganj Road) is \\nexpected to be completed by FY2021.  \\n \\nSource: RHD    \\n \\n384 \\n The Bridges Division :  The Bridges Division is responsible for implementation and maintenance of bridges \\nand tunnels of 1500 m or more, flyover/overpass, expressway, causeway and ring road etc. As noted, during \\nthe 7FYP a strategic decision was taken to put emphasis on the major transformational projects many of \\nwhich are under the Bangladesh Bridges Authority (BBA) , Bridges Division .  The major on-going  projects \\nduring the 7FYP are:  Padma Mu ltipurpose Bridge Project; Dhaka Elevated Expressway PPP Project; \\nSupport to Dhaka Elevated Expressway PPP Project; Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman tunnel under \\nthe river Karnaphuli; Dhaka -Ashulia Elevated Expressway; and BRT (Gazipur -Airport) (4.5 km el evated \\nsection)  along with Bangladesh Bridge Authority taken initiative for Fe asibility study of construction of \\nSubway in Dhaka city and fe asibility study for construction of bridges on Putuakhali - Amtoli -Borguna road \\nover the river Paira, on Bakergong -Baufal road over the river Karkhana, on Bhulta - Araihazar -\\nBancharampur road over the river Meghna, On Baris al –Bhola road over the river Kalabadar and Tetulia \\nand Borguna -Patharghata road over the river Bishkhali . \\nThe projects are being implemented on a fast -track completion program and are expected to be completed \\nby June 2022. The construction of the most important Padma Bridge is scheduled to be completed in June \\n2021. The first underwater tunnel of Bangladesh named Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel  \\n(Karnaphuli Tunnel) is expected to be completed by 2022.    \\nRural roads:  The importance of rural road connectivity to market centres  (rural and urban ) was preserved \\nin the 7FYP.  The LGED has developed the rural transport infrastructure b ased on long term  Master Plan \\n(2005 -2025). The progress during the 7FYP is summarized in Table 6.2. A major focus of LGED was on \\nimproving the quality of the rural road network by paving of existing road and reconstruction of damaged \\npaved road.   Each year on average abou t 5000 km road has been upgraded and 30000 meters bridge/culvert \\nhas been added. The focus on rural road quality is appropriate in view of damage caused by monsoon rain \\nand flooding. Rural road connectivity has played an important role in helping productiv ity of rural activities \\nand reducing poverty.  \\nTable 6.2: Development of Rural Transport Infrastructure under LGED  \\nComponent  FY2015 -16 FY2016 -17 FY2017 -18 FY2018 -19 Total  \\nEarthen road (km)  - - - - 32500  \\nPaved road (km)  4813  5220  5300  4663  21721  \\nBridge/cu lvert (m)  28500  29000  29500  9933  96933  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh Economic Review 2019  \\nThe performance of roads and bridges subsector in relation to targets set during the 7FYP is shown in Table \\n6.3.  Overall, the physical targets were met, w hich is commendable. Progress was also made to improve the \\nsafety of road transports. Under the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011 -2020, RHD is \\nworking to reduce road accident fatalities by 50% within the year 2020. The five pillars of ro ad safety are \\nroad safety management, safe road and traffic, safe motor vehicles, cautious road users and the \\nimplementation of post -accident activities.  Accordingly, RHD has formulated the National Road Safety \\nStrategic Action Plan (NRSSAP) 2017 -20, whic h is being implemented in accordance with the road safety \\nrelated targets set forth under SDG. However, notwithstanding good progress, a major constraint in the road \\nand highways subsector has been implementation capacity that has contributed to project co mpletion delays \\nand cost overruns.  Further efforts are needed to strengthen implementation of road safety measures.    \\n \\n385 \\n Table 6.3: Roads and Highways Targets for the Seventh Five Year Plan (2015/16 -2019/20)  \\nPhysical Activities  Unit  7FYP Targets  Actual Perform ance  \\nConstruction of 4 lane roads  km 300 393 \\nConstruction of roads other than 4 lanes  km 340 350 \\nImprovement/ Rehabilitation of roads  km 2,500  4925  \\nConstruction of Flyover/Overpass  meter  7,000  7580  \\nConstruction of bridges/culverts  meter  14,800  24254  \\nReconstruction of bridges/culverts  meter  6,800  6830  \\nSource 7FYP and Ministry of  Road  Transport  & Bridges  \\n6.2.2  Progress with Railway Services  \\nThe improvement of rail communication was accorded high priority in the 7FYP.The Railway investment \\nprogram was guided by the Railway Master Plan 2010 -2030 that was approved in 2004 and updated in \\n2017.  It also drew inspiration from the National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy (NIMTP) of 2013.   \\nA total of 230 projects with TK 5537 billion were  taken up in t he development plan, which included \\nconstruction of new line, procurement of rolling stock for passenger and freight, and rehabilitation of \\nexisting railway station and signalling  system. Implementation of the development plan has yielded \\nsignificant impro vement in the overall performance of Bangladesh Railway in terms of service delivery \\n(both passenger and freight) (Table 6.4).  However, the financial performance  is an area where further \\nattention will be needed.  \\nTable 6.4: Overall Performance of Banglade sh Railway in the 7FYP  \\nFiscal year  Passenger km  \\n(million)  Freight Ton -km \\n(million)  Total operating \\nrevenue (Tk in million)  Total operating expenses \\n(Tk in million ) \\n2013 -14 8134  677 8000  16010  \\n2014 -15 8711  693 9350  18080  \\n2015 -16 9167  675 9040  22290  \\n2016 -17 10040  1052  1300  28350  \\n2017 -18 12883  1236  12760  29180  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh Economic Review 2019  \\n6.2.3  Inland Water Transport (IWT)  \\nInland Water Transport (IWT) is an extremely energy efficient, environmentally clean and economical \\nmode of transport. But it has not been able to realize its full growth potential partly because of the excessive \\nattention to the road sector. Bangladesh has about 14,000 km of waterways (rivers/canals) of which about \\n5,968 kms remain navigable during mons oon and 3865 km of rivers/canals are navigable during the dry \\nseason. The water transport network of the country not only caters to the inland movement of freight and \\npassengers but also plays an important role in the transportation of import and export it ems through the \\nports of Chittagong and Mongla. During the monsoon season when roads become impassable, riverboats \\nare the only mode of transport for an important part of the Bangladesh’s rural population. The country boat \\nplays significant role and provid es for about 50% of the total employment in the transport sector as a whole. \\nThey are also the main mode of transport in the south coastal areas where the road network is little \\ndeveloped. Currently, most of these waterways suffer from navigational hazards  like shallow water and \\nnarrow width of channel during dry weather, siltation, bank erosion, absence of infrastructure constrained \\nby the absence of proper surface road links to facilitate the smooth transit of cargo.    \\n \\n386 \\n Recognizing the high potential of inl and water transport, the Government completed an Inland Water \\nTransport Master Plan (IWTMP) in 2009.  This was a comprehensive study of the major constraints and \\nmade very useful recommendations on reforms and investments. However , implementation has not \\nprogressed much.  The 7FYP sought to push forward these reforms by placing strong emphasis on IWT. \\nThe 7FYP strategy emphasized 4 key elements: development of new waterways and navigability of existing \\nchannels; focus on operations and maintenance and estab lishment of landing stations and river ports for \\nbulk cargo and containers; digitization of services related to IWT system; and facilitating maritime \\neducation and training.  Progress with implementation of the 7FYP strategy has been mixed due to a number \\nof constraints including inadequate resources, high -cost dredging operations to improve navigability of \\nriver routes, institutional weakness and inadequate inter -agency coordination. The 8FYP will seek to offset \\nthese constraints and improve the role of in land water transportation to improve the inter -modal balance, \\nreduce transport cost, and protect the environment.   \\n6.2.4  Shipping Subsector Progress  \\nWith the expansion of international trade, the importance of shipping as a major source of non -factor ser vice \\n(NFS) export earnings has increased. Bangladesh presently has a huge deficit on the NFS account that could \\nbe lowered substantially through the expansion of international cargo shipping capabilities. The  prospective \\nreturns to this investment are high. The  Shipping industry is managed and regulated by the Department of \\nShipping (DoS). The DoS is a regulatory body under the administrative control of the Ministry of Shipping. \\nIt administers maritime and shipping laws of the country. It deals, among other s, safety, security and \\nprevention of marine pollution through implementation of maritime laws and regulations.  \\nOn the operation side, majority of shipping business is operated by the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation \\n(BSC), a state -owned, autonomous corpora tion in Bangladesh. There are also private shipping operators. \\nThe BSC owns a number of ships and oil tankers, and also charters sea -going vessels from other operators. \\nThe vessels are used to carry ready -made garments and other export items, and also to i mport crude oil and \\nother commodities from abroad.  \\nThe 7FYP sought to expanding shipping capacity, improve automation and increase export earnings .  \\nEarnings from shipping have grown from $ 300 million in FY2015 to $500 million in FY2019, but this is \\nfar below potential and the gap between Bangladesh earnings from shipping freight and payments to the \\nrest of the world is huge.  Some of the main constraints include inadequate shipping capacity, shortage of \\nresources, inadequate technical capabilities in an environment of changing global technology in shipping, \\nstaffing problems and management. So, stronger efforts are needed to make this an important source of \\nexport earnings. The 8FYP will put emphasis on boosting the role of international shipping  and will  \\nemphasise on commercial viability .  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n387 \\n Table 6.5: Shipping Sector Performance in the 7FYP  \\nDevelopment activities  7FYP Target  7 FYP Achievement  \\nProcurement of ships.

The Civil Aviation Authority of \\nBangladesh (CAAB) functions as the regulatory  body for all aviation related activities, serving as the \\ncustodian of all airfields and allied facilities including air navigation facilities. It is now maintaining 3 \\ninternational airports and 7 domestic airports and 2 Short Take -Off and Landing (STOL) p orts. Out of these, \\n8 airports (3 international and 5 domestic) are in operation. Due to inadequacy of passengers, no flight is \\noperating at 2 other domestic airports and 2 STOL ports.  \\nHazrat Shahajalal International Airport (HSIA) at Dhaka is the busiest airport in Bangladesh through which \\n80% of the total air traffic flow takes place. The airport has a capacity of handling 8 million passengers \\nannually, and in the meantime it is already saturated. Air traffic volume has increased at 8% during last 3 \\nyears . In 2019 , it handled 13.09  million passengers, and 0.412286  Million  tonnes of cargo. Average aircraft \\nmovement per day is around 260 no. of flights. The opening up of air traffic to private domestic carriers \\nhas also paid dividends in terms of quality and  frequency of air services. With growing income, the demand \\nfor international and domestic air services continues to grow. The existing terminal and runway are not \\nA380 or B747 -8F compliant. It has become necessary for upgrading and expanding HSIA, to meet  the \\ngrowing air traffic demand and to accommodate Code F Aircraft (A380, B747 -8F). \\nThe 7FYP adopted a comprehensive strategy to strengthen the operational capabilities of existing facilities and \\ndevelop new airports. The  main elements included: (i) Expans ion of operational capabilities at HSIA; (ii) \\nConversion of the Cox’s Bazar Airport into international airport with capabilities to operate wide -body jets; (iii) \\nEnhancement of cargo facilities at the Chittagong Shah Amanat International Airport (SAIA); (i v) Strengthen \\nrunway infrastructure at SAIA; (v) Strengthen runway at the Sylhet Osmani International Airport (OIA); (vi) \\nConstruction of a new airport at the Southern region of Bangladesh; (vii) Improvement of communications system \\nbetween the coastal bel t airports and the capital city of Dhaka  and (viii) Complete feasibility study for the \\nconstruction of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib International Airport  (BSMIA).    \\n \\n388 \\n Progress shows mixed performance, especially in the area of new airports. The capacity of HSIA has been \\nsubstantially expanded and its layout and service quality has significantly improved.  The air cargo handling \\ncapacity has expanded. The  quality and safety standard for air traffic management has increased. Progress  \\nwas also made to expand an d upgrade facilities at the Chittagong and Sylhet airports. Facilities at the local \\nairports have expanded that has enabled handling of a growing volume of domestic air traffic and services \\nto private airlines. Inter -district air traffic management has als o improved along with better communication \\nfacilities with Dhaka HSIA. The feasibility study for BSMIA has not yet completed and progress in \\nconverting Cox’s Bazar domestic terminal to international terminal has lagged. The proposed construction \\nof a new a irport in the Southern region of Bangladesh has also not happened.  \\nThe major constraints faced by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism  include  procurement problems, \\nproject implementation capacity constraints and financing, especially in the matter o f negotiating foreign \\ntransactions.  The efficiency and service capacity of the national air carrier, Bangladesh Biman, has \\nincreased but the performance remains much below the competitors from the major competitors like Qatar \\nAirways, Emirates and Thai Ai rways. As a result, earnings from BB are much lower than true potential.               \\n6.2.6  Maritime Ports Subsector Progress  \\nThe maritime port sector plays an important role in the country’s development, especially growth of GDP \\nthrough sea borne trade.  Total tonnage of sea borne trade is presently over 45 million tons, growing over \\n10 per cent  per annum. Chittagong and Mongla are the only two sea borne trade ports in Bangladesh, \\nalthough the functioning of a third port, the Payra Port, is underway.   \\nChittagong Port Authority : The Chittagong Port is the principal maritime port and handles about 92% of \\nthe country’s sea borne export and import trade. As a port it acts as the linkage between the inland and sea \\ntransportation of goods. In future the port ma y also provide international transit facilities to neighbouring  \\ncountries mainly Nepal, Bhutan and other eastern states of India.   \\nDuring the 7FYP, the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) achieved enormous progress in cargo and container \\nhandling as well as i n development works (Table 6.6). The CPA carried out capital and maintenance \\ndredging to keep the navigability of the Karnaphuli channel in expected level.  \\nTable 6.6: CPA Traffic Performance in 7FYP  \\nFiscal \\nYear  Projected Traffic  Actual Traffic  \\nImport  \\n(Mill.

The  CPA also procured 150 cargo and container handling equipment \\nincluding 10 Ship to Shore Gantry Cranes to cope with the ever-growing demand. The CPA expanded its   \\n \\n389 \\n container holding capacity from 37,000 TEU’s to 50000 TEUs facilitate trade, the Government and CPA \\nencouraged private sector to establish ICD (off docks) to ensure door -to-door services. During 7FYP plan \\ntwo new p rivate ICDs were established.  Presently, a total 18 private ICDs are in operation.  \\nIn the meantime, CPA has extended its port limit up to Kutubdia in the South and Sitakunda in the North. \\nAs a part of its extended logistic support, CPA procured one Tug bo at (3200 BHP), one seagoing low \\nfreeboard harbours  Tug boat (2000 BHP) and two mooring launch. CPA increased its permissible draft \\nfrom 9.14 meter to 9.5 meter and permissible length 186 meter to 190 meters during the 7FYP. The CPA \\nhas completed the constr uction of one CFS (Container Freight Station) shed, one car parking shed and one \\nCustom Auction Shed to enhance its operational capacity. The  construction of the Patenga Container \\nTerminal (PCT)” project is underway and it is expected to become operational  by June 2021.The Chittagong \\nPort Expansion project has been planned to increase the yard facilities of Chittagong Port. The project \\nlocation is near the Bay Terminal and wit hin the land area acquired for b y Terminal. Moreover, the \\ngovernment of Bangladesh  with the Japanese support will implement 34 projects in Maheshkhali -Matarbari \\narea to accelerate the pace of economic development in Bangladesh. Besides, deep sea port with coal -based \\npower plant, special economic zones, coal jetty and LNG terminals will be built in Matarbari. Upon \\ncompletion of the Matarbari Port Development Project, which is being implemented under the Chattogram \\nPort Authority, it will be treated as a commercial hub of the region.  \\nThe CPA has continued its leadership role in terms of be ing amongst the most financially profitable public \\nauthority during the 7FYP (Table 6.7). Overall, the CPA performed very well during the 7FYP, meeting or \\nexceeding its planned targets and sets an example for other state -owned enterprises (SOEs ) to emulate .  \\nTable 6.7: CPA Financial Performance during the 7FYP (Tk. billion)  \\nYear  No. of Ships \\nHandled  Revenue Income  Revenue Expenditure  Revenue Surplus  \\n2015 -16 2875  20.3 10.7 9.6 \\n2016 -17 3092  24.1 13.5 10.6 \\n2017 -18 3664  26.6 13.9 12.7 \\n2018 -19 3699  29.3 15.9 13.4 \\nSource: Chittagong Port Authority  \\nMongla Port Authority (MPA):  Mongla Port, the second gateway of Bangladesh is the eco-friendliest  \\nseaport of the country. The port is well -protected by the largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans. Since \\n1950, Mong la Port Authority is functioning as an international sea port. It has substantial unused capacity \\nand has huge potential advantages in terms of turn -around time.  The Mongla port is also capable of \\nfacilitating trade between north -west part of Bangladesh, N epal, Bhutan and places adjacent to the Indian \\nborder.  \\nIn view of its great potential to provide an alternative shipping route to the heavily congested Chittagong \\nPort, efforts were made in the 7FYP to expand the traffic through the Mongla Port. Through  a major \\ndredging project, the navigability issue was addressed that increased the water depth of the outer bar of the \\nPassur River, enabling vessels with drafts over 10 meters to berth at the port.  This investment allowed a \\nrapid expansion of port activiti es. Total cargo handling expanded at an average pace of 20% per year, \\ngrowing from 4.5 million metric tons to 11.3 million metric tons in FY2019.    \\n \\n390 \\n Payra Port Authority (PPA ): The Payra Port Act 2013 established the third sea port of Bangladesh located \\non the bank of the Ra mnabad Channel in Kalapara,  a sub district of Patuakhali.  The main task under the \\n7FYP is project implementation, using a phased approach. Limited scale operational activities of Payra Sea \\nPort started on August 13, 2016 developing some b asic infrastructures and transferring the goods through \\nsing barges by inland waterways.  The Payra Port Authority has already implemented a Service Yard of 48 \\nacres of land connected by 4 lane road to National Highway. This Service Yard consists of RCC Ser vice \\nJetty, various Supporting Buildings, Water Treatment Plant, Warehouse etc. Some 6,500 acres of land is \\nunder acquisition for development of core port infrastructures. Among those amount of land 3,100 acres \\nhas already been acquired.  It is expected tha t by 202 3 Payra will be fully operational as an international sea \\nport through completion of capital dredging project and constructing at least three terminals with 12 berths \\nand channel depth (CD) of 10.5 m. According to the “Traffic Forecast Study Report ” prepared by Royal \\nHaskonning DHV, total volumes  of cargos are projected to grow at Para Port from 11.1 million MT in 2021 \\nto 33.6 million MT in 2025. As per long -term plan, it is expected that by 2035 the Para Port will be able to \\nfunction with at least 14.0m CD through a second phase capital dredging and capacity to handle about 89.8 \\nmillion MT cargos and 5.1 million TEUs container.  \\nBangladesh Land Port Authority (BLPA)  \\nBangladesh Land Port Authority (BLPA) was established in 2001 under the Bangladesh La nd Port \\nAuthority Act 2001 as a statutory regulatory body with a vision to expedite and facilitate export -import \\nactivities through land ports. Bangladesh Land Port Authority started its activities through declaration of \\n12 land ports in 2001. Afterwards, 12 more land customs stations have been declared as land ports. At \\npresent, total number of land ports are 24. Among them, Benapole, Bhomra, Akhaura, Burimari , Tamabil, \\nNakugaon and Sonahat Land Port are being operated by own management of BLPA. On the oth er hand, \\nSonamasjid, Hilli, Teknaf, Banglabandha & Bibirbazar Land Ports are being operated on Build Operate \\nTransfer (BOT) basis. With a view to start operation of the remaining land ports, the process for acquiring \\nland along with the construction of nec essary infrastructures are going on. The remaining lands ports will \\nbe developed and operated by government own management.  \\nIn view of the growing importance of land port -based trade with India, the 7FYP put emphasis on improving \\nthe capabilities of the v arious land ports through better facilities and staffing and improving efficiency and \\nturn-around time through digitization. Considerable progress was made. The  Sonahat and Tamabil land \\nports have been developed with a cost of Tk. 110.00 crore and they sta rted their operational activities. Also, \\nimprovement & modernization of Benapole & Burimari Land Ports has been completed under SASEC \\nRoad Connectivity Project with assistance from ADB.   Construction of modern warehouses, transhipment  \\nshed and improvement of roads & yards, drainage system and other necessary infrastructure have been \\ndeveloped under this project. To enhance connectivity and trade with neighbouring countries, BLPA has \\ntaken steps for development of Sheola and Ramgarh land ports along with ext ension & modernization of \\nBhomra and Benapole Land Ports with a cost Tk. 693 crore with the financial assistance of World Bank. \\nThis is an on-going  project which is expected to be completed by June 2023. BLPA has taken initiatives \\nfor upgrading of remainin g land ports. Necessary steps have already been taken for digitalization of land \\nports.   \\n   \\n \\n391 \\n As a result of these efforts to expand and upgrade the land ports in the 7FYP, the total trade (exports and \\nimports) passing through land ports was 34.26 lac metric tons in FY2009.  It grew to 216.63 lac metric tons \\nin FY2019, indicating an average yearly growth rate of 29 %. The revenue income of BLPA was Tk. 26.74 \\ncrore in FY2009.  Thi s expanded to Taka 210.93 crore  in FY2019.  The revenue growth was particularly \\nlarge in the last 5 years, growing by 31.2%.  \\n6.2.7  Urban Transport  \\nRapid urbanization in Bangladesh during the last few decades increased transport demand quite \\nsignificantly leading to manifold increases in the number of motorized and non -motorized vehicl es on city \\nstreets. The increase in the number of vehicles relative to road facilities has led to severe congestion on \\nroads and deterioration in urban environment. Such trends are likely to continue as further urbanization \\ntakes place.  \\nIn urban areas, roa d transport system is the main means for carrying passengers and commodities. However, \\nall urban centres  face major traffic congestion due to the absence of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)  options.  \\nAmong the six city corporations, Dhaka is confronted with the mo st serious transportation problems. The \\ntransport sector of the city is comprised of many different modes of travel -both motorized and non -\\nmotorized -often using the same road space – resulting in a high level of operational disorder, which \\nsignificantly di minishes the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing transport uses.  \\nTo address the urban transport challenge, the 7FYP undertook a major initiative to develop a long -term \\nplan. A Revised Strategic Transport Plan (RSTP) was prepared by Dhaka Transpor t Coordination Authority  \\n(DTCA) for greater Dhaka area. In RSTP, a series of rapid rail transit and rapid bus transit options are \\nproposed to address the massive congestion problem of Dhaka and its adjoining areas.   The Dhaka Mass \\nTransit Company Limited ( DMTCL) has been established for construction, operation & maintenance of the \\nMass Rapid Transit (MRT) Lines/Metro Rails in Dhaka city and its adjoining areas. The Government has \\nformulated a Time -bound Action Plan 2030 in order to establish a state -of-the-art Network of public \\ntransport system to be implemented by Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) consisting of 6 \\nMass Rapid Transit (MRT) or Metrorail Lines covering the distance of 128 .741 Kilometres (67.57 \\nkilometres  elevated and 61.17 kilometers u nderground) having 104 Stations (51 elevated and 53 \\nunderground) in Dhaka and its adjoining areas. Based on this action plan, t he targeted completion of the first \\nelevated Metro Rail of Bangladesh, known as MRT Line-6, has been set for December 2022. Subst antial \\nprogress of construction works of four more MRT Lines (Line -1; Line-5: Northern Route; Line-5: Southern \\nRoute and Line -2) are also underway  within  the 7FYP (Table 6.8) . Work has also started on the first of the \\nthree proposed rapid bus transit (BRT)  alleviated expressway. The first BRT route (BRT Line 3) is scheduled \\nfor completion in CY2020.  While these are all excellent initiatives, a major challenge is their time completion.  \\nProgress was also made in addressing road safety and enforcing traffic laws and regulations.  Besides, \\nBridges Division has undertaken a feasibility study project for the construction of subway across 238 km \\ncovering the entire Dhaka city. The study will be completed by June 2021. Nevertheless, given the massive \\ntraffic manag ement challenge, there is a long way to go.  \\n    \\n \\n392 \\n Table 6.8: Progress with Dhaka Urban Mass Rapid Transit Options  \\nMRT/BRT  Length \\n(km)  Type  Completion \\nDate  Project Status  Source of \\nFinance  \\nMRT Line -6 20.10  Elevated  2022  Under Construction  JICA & GoB  \\nMRT Line -1 31.241  Elevated (11.369 Km)  2026  Detail Design on-going  JICA & GoB  \\nUnderground (19.872 Km)  \\nMRT Line -5: \\nNorthern \\nRoute  20.00  Elevated (6.50 Km)  2028  Basic Design On-going  JICA & GoB  \\nUnderground (13.50 Km)  \\nMRT Line -5: \\nSouthern \\nRoute  17.40  Elevated (4.60 Km)  2030  Appointment of \\nConsultant is at final \\nstage  ADB & GoB  \\nUnderground (12.80 Km)  \\nMRT Line -2 24.00  Elevated (15.00 Km)  2030  Full Scale Study on-\\ngoing  G2G (Japan)  \\nthrough PPP \\nmethod  Underground (09.00 Km) \\nMRT Line -4 16.00  Elevated  2030  G2G through PPP \\nMethod  Underway  \\nTotal  128.741 [Elevated 67.57 km and Underground 61.17km]  \\nSource: Ministry of Road Transport & Bridges  \\n6.2.8  Transport Sector Issues and Challenges during the 7FYP  \\nOverall substantial progress was made in impro ving the transport network, especially in the area of road \\nnetwork, Sea and Ports, and Railways. Progress  was somewhat slow in inland water, airport and Bridges.  \\nThis progress was facilitated by adequate allocation of financial resources. As a result of t he priority \\naccorded to transport, financing was not a constraint. A useful way to assess this progress and its adequacy \\nin relation to the competitiveness of the Bangladesh economy is to compare the progress with competitors. \\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF ) publishes on an annual cycle updates of global competitiveness \\nranking for countries based on a global competitiveness index (GCI) and the associated infrastructure \\nquality rankings. The latest GCI and Infrastructure Quality rankings are available for 20 19. These are shown \\nin Table 6.9.  \\nTable 6.9: Bangladesh’s Global Competitiveness Index and Infrastructure Quality 2019  \\n(Scores out of 100; Number of Countries 141)  \\nCountry  Global \\nCompetitiveness  Transport \\nInfrastructure  Quality \\nof \\nRoads  Quality \\nof \\nRailway  Quality \\nof Port  Quality of \\nAir \\nTransport  \\nScore  Country \\nRanking  Score  Country \\nRanking  Ranking  Ranking  Ranking  Ranking  \\nBangladesh  52.1 105 42.1 100 108 65 92 109 \\nIndia  61.4 68 66.4 28 48 30 49 59 \\nTurkey  51.6 108 64.9 33 31 56 41 34 \\nPakistan  51.4 110 51.1 69 67 47 70 93 \\nSrilanka  57.1 84 57.7 50 76 72 68 72 \\nThailand  68.1 40 56.8 53 55 75 48 73 \\nChina  73.9 28 68.9 24 45 24 52 66 \\nVietnam  61.5 67 52.2 66 103 54 83 103 \\nSource: The Global Competitiveness Report 2019, World Economic Forum.    \\n \\n393 \\n Comparisons wit h past rankings show that Bangladesh has gained in overall competitiveness ranking and \\nespecially transport infrastructure performance ranking. This  suggests that the progress made in the 7FYP \\nin transport infrastructure has helped improve its global compe titiveness. However, other competitors have \\nperformed more strongly in improving the transport infrastructure services. Bangladesh  does well in the \\narea of railway services, but relative performance falls short of performance in other countries that compet e \\nwith Bangladesh in the export market, especially the RMG competitors in China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, \\nTurkey and Vietnam.   \\nA review of performance in the 7FYP shows that there are a number of areas where greater policy attention \\nwill be needed in t he 8FYP.  \\nImplementation capacity constraint : A major challenge that continued during the 7FYP has been the \\nimplementation capacity constraint. Consequently, while projects have started, completions have lagged \\nbehind.  Progress in implementation has been most serious in the road and bridges sub -sector where project \\nimplementation delays and cost over -runs have lowered the economic rate of return for many investments.  \\nIn civil aviation subsector, project completion has suffered from procurement and interna tional financing \\nnegotiation constraints.  \\nTransport sector policies : On the policy front, progress on PPP based transport network development has \\nlagged behind the target. The  PPP activities have shown some recent signs of recovery, which is \\nencouraging. But stronger efforts are needed to fast track, the idea of introducing cost recovery from road \\nusers through the institution of a well -designed road user charges still remains to be made effective. In \\nrailways, progress with capacity expansion and service efficiency improvements has not been matched with \\ntariff increases and cost recovery, which has led to the inability of railways to cover operating costs.  \\nInter -modal balance : Improvement in rail performance has improved the inter -modal transport balance but \\nthe inadequate progress with expanding water transport services remains a major concern. IWT is a low -\\ncost mode of transportation and greatly facilitate inter -city transportation while lowering the pressure on \\nthe high -cost road transportation.  Import antly, the inland water transport is the most environmentally \\nfriendly transport mode, yet its shares in passenger and freight services are small and falling. The challenges \\nfaced by IWT are manifold including the issue of navigability, inadequacy of safet y standards, inadequate \\nof port facilities, weak finances and management problems. A strong push will be needed in the 8FYP to \\nunlock the full potential of this great transport asset.   \\nEfficiency of port use :  In response to growing demand, the government  has sought to increase port capacity \\nby launching the Pyra port and a program to expand the Chittagong Port.  These are important. Yet , despite \\nefforts, the Mongla Port remains under -utilized. Progress  in addressing the CD issue of the Passur River \\nthroug h strategic dredging is a welcome move, but stronger efforts are needed to enhance the use and \\nproductivity of this underutilized asset through strategic planning and greater resource allocation.  Opening \\nup the port to neighbouring  countries is a smart mo ve, but this must be facilitated by coordinated \\ninvestments to enable the full use of the potential of the Mongla port.  \\nPort to factory connectivity : The further acceleration in growth under PP2041 and the 8FYP and the \\nassociated diversification of the ex port basket will require strong improvements in trade logistics related to \\nfactory to port movements and timely inflow of imports of capital machinery and intermediate imports from   \\n \\n394 \\n ports to factory gate. The capacity and efficiency of the sea - and airport services and the ease of internal \\ntransportation are critical to the success of the export diversification strategy, for the ease of procuring \\nimported inputs, and for transporting goods and services from the production centres to the consumption \\ncentres.    \\nUpgrading of airport services :  Rapid growth in income has  generated a huge demand for air transport \\nservices at the national and international level s.  Bangladesh also has good prospects for strengthening its \\ntourism capabilities. Bangladesh  civil avia tion has made important progress during the 7FYP but there is a \\nlarge unfinished agenda that remains to be addressed.  The airport capacity for both passenger and freight \\nneed urgent upgrading. Project  implementation constraints have slowed capacity expans ion Upgrading of \\nairport services will be an important challenge for the 8FYP.  \\n6.3  8FYP VISION FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR  \\nThe 8FYP Vision for the transport sector is linked to the PP2041 Vision that envisages a Bangladesh where:  \\n\\uf0b7 There is seamless flow in passen ger and goods traffic and transport facilities are available on demand.  \\n\\uf0b7 People have efficient choices between different modes of transport facilities at affordable cost and \\ntime.  \\n\\uf0b7 All transport services are provided competitively with no barriers to entry a nd exit for service \\nproviders.  \\n\\uf0b7 There is strong inter -district and inter -regional connectivity with neighbouring countries for \\npassengers, goods and services with choices of alternative transport modes.  \\n\\uf0b7 The safety standards are well established and the tran sport system is accountable through legal \\nprovisions for full compliance with safety standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Urban traffic flows are well managed through a combination of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) /Metro \\nRail Network , BRTC Double Decker/Articulated Bus Service  and priva te options that balance \\ncommuter needs for easy transit with avoidance of massive congestion.  \\n\\uf0b7 All parking and traffic laws are enforced with appropriate sanctions for non -compliance irrespective \\nof political or administration connections.   \\n\\uf0b7 Developed seapo rts to cope with International Maritime Transport Sector.  \\n\\uf0b7 3R (Rail, Road and Riverine ) intermodal connectivity to support the hinterland connectivity of all \\nports of Bangladesh.  \\n\\uf0b7 Road safety issues (loss of lives and damages of wealth due to road accidents)  arising out of use of \\nmotor vehicles and human traffic in roadways are well resolved.  \\n\\uf0b7 Crash data are timely and rightly managed through integrated and well managed digital system.  \\n\\uf0b7 Vehicle road worthiness (fitness) is well tested through automated vehicle inspection centres .  \\n\\uf0b7 Road users are well aware of safe use of road ways.  \\n\\uf0b7 Motor vehicles drivers are well trained to negotiate safe drive.     \\n \\n395 \\n The PP2041 converted this Vision into a broad long -term strategic framework with long -term goals and \\ntargets.  The 8 FYP goals, targets, strategy, policies and investment program are all inter -linked with \\nPP2041.   \\n6.4  8FYP TRANSPORT SECTOR TARGETS  \\nThe transport sector PP2041 Vision is very challenging in the context of the present situation but is very \\nmuch consistent with  the transport environment in a high -income economy. Consistent with that Vision, \\nthe transport sector targets of PP2041 are also very demanding. As  a first step towards realizing the PP2041 \\ntransport sector vision, the 8FYP draws on the PP2041 targets and  outlines the first phase of the four -phased \\nmedium -term program targets. The related targets are indicated in Table 6.10. The targets show both the \\nmassive growth in the demand for transport services to meet the needs of a growing and transforming \\neconomy  and major changes in inter -modal transport that is needed to improve the efficiency and cost -\\neffectiveness of the transport system.  For domestic travel, the balance of transport services changes in \\nfavour of rail and inland water and away from the excess ive reliance on the road network.  This happens \\nfor both passenger movements and freight, but especially for freight.  Port and air traffic capacities are \\nprojected to grow rapidly to meet the growing demand from higher GDP growth. Urban transport changes \\nare particularly dramatic as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)/Metro Rail Network transit options are introduced \\ninitially in the capital city of Dhaka  and its adjoining areas . Additionally, it is expected that a s the roadways \\nexpand, quality of road infrastructure s gets improved, road worthiness of on road vehicle fleets  are ensured \\nboth mechanically and environmentally, drivers are well trained and road users are well aware of safe uses \\nof road ways.  \\nTable 6.10: 8FYP Transport Sector Targets  \\nIndicators   FY2019 \\n(base Year)  FY2025  \\nPassenger Traffic (billion passenger kilometres ) Roads  169 246 \\nInland Water  16 23 \\nRailways  10 15 \\nTotal  195 284 \\nFreight Traffic (billion -tonnes kilometres ) Roads  24 31 \\nInland Water  5 7 \\nRailways  2 3 \\nTotal  31 41 \\nAir Traffic (mil lion passengers / million tons)  Passenger  13.09  14.63  \\nFreight  0.41 0.50 \\nSea Port Cargo Traffic (million numbers /million tonnes)  Container  2.9 3.6 \\nTonnes  98.24  122 \\nUrban mass transit  No of cities  0 1 \\nTransport Infrastructure quality  Country ranking  100 80 \\nScore  42 47 \\nRoad safety accident death rate by country (WHO 2018)  (Per 100,000)  14.43  13.0 \\nSource: GED Projections.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n396 \\n 6.5 TRANSPORT SECTOR STRATEGY FOR 8FYP  \\nThe transport strategy for 8FYP will build on the lessons of experience of the implementat ion of the 7FYP \\nand the PP2021. An important priority will be to address the implementation gaps of the 7FYP strategy. \\nThe other priority will be to address the major institutional constraints that have hampered implementation \\nof transport projects. A  third priority is the reform of the PPP strategy with a view to achieving stronger \\nprogress under the 8FYP.Finally, one of the important lessons of the 7FYP is that Bangladesh needs to be \\nmore strategic about identifying major transport projects and then alloc ating resources accordingly. The \\npriority should be what is deemed as transformational infrastructure investment . This  initiative already \\nstarted under the 7FYP.  The 8FYP will further reinforce it to ensure the timely adoption and completion \\nof the highes t priority transport projects.  \\nStrengthening long -term planning and priority setting : The physical targets for the transport sector are \\nlarge as reflected in Table 6.5. These involve large investments and strong implementation capacity.  Both \\nare scarce in  Bangladesh.  So, careful planning and priority settings are critical elements of the 8FYP \\ntransport strategy. Bangladesh  has experience in developing long -term transport planning. For example, the \\nroad network expansion program is guided by the 2004 -2024 Road Sector Master Plan; there is a Rural \\nRoad Master Plan of 2005 -2025 that guides the expansion of rural roads; an Inland Water Transport Master \\nPlan was completed in 2009 that provided a 20-year investment program; the railway master plan 2010 -\\n2030 was approved in 2005; and the National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy was approved in \\n2013.The implementation of these plans has been uneven and halting. Building  on these plans and \\nimplementation experiences, a fresh look will be taken to develop a lo ng-term Transport Sector Master Plan \\n2041 (TSMP 2041) with international technical assistance. There are several good practice transport \\nplanning and development experiences in East Asia, especially Japan, Korea and China. Bangladesh can \\nlearn from these e xperiences. The TSMP 2041 will focus on the major transport investments for Bangladesh \\nfor the 2021 -2041 periods, provide a picture of the optimal inter -modal transport balance, and identify \\npriorities and a phased approach to their development.  \\nCreating b alanced inter -modal seamless transport facility : While roads will continue to dominate the \\ntransport network, land constraints, social disruption, environmental concerns and unit cost considerations \\nwill require a much more balanced development of the tran sport network with greater emphasis on inland \\nwater transport and railways. Both these modes are under -utilized.  The 8FYP will give priority to \\ndeveloping these modes to reduce the pressure on roads and also to strengthen inter -modal coordination. \\nThe Por t to factory gate connection and vice versa via river routes, for example, can be a major improvement \\nin trade logistics. These and other options to improve the intermodal transport balance will be adopted based \\non an integrated transport planning process that will be regularly updated to reflect the changing traffic dynamics.  \\nStrengthening implementation capacity:  Implementation  constraints slowed down the implementation of \\nmany large transport projects causing cost overruns and delays in project completio n.  This reduces the \\nquality and rate of return for these investments. The government has put top priority to timely completion \\nof all on-going  projects. The  8FYP will further strengthen this by closely monitoring completion of all large \\ntransport projects , ensuring timely release of funds, linking new investment approvals to the record of \\nproject implementation, improving procurement policies, paying greater attention to project design before \\nproject approval, ensuring project implementation readiness as a n important criteria for project approval, \\nand strengthening capacities of line ministries and public agencies through improvement in technical \\ncapacities based on training and also through recruitment of special skills from private sector on contractual   \\n \\n397 \\n basis. For large and complex projects, international competitive bidding process will be followed and \\nemphasis will be given for turn -key project contracts with strict monitoring and penalty clauses for timely \\ndelivery of projects in agreed quality and pric e. \\nEnsuring sustainable financing of transport infrastructure:  The massive expansion in transport \\ninfrastructure implied by the targets set in Table 6.5 will require huge investments. In the 7FYP the \\ngovernment put top most priority to the development of t ransport infrastructure and provided adequate \\nfunding from the budget. Owing to implementation capacity constraints, funding was often not fully used. \\nAs noted above, the 8FYP will assign priority to strengthening implementation capacity.  Nevertheless, th e \\nvolume of funding required is massive and would average around 5% of GDP per year over the FY2021 -\\nFY2025 periods.  Such large funding cannot be provided by the budget alone.  The government recognized \\nthis early on and identified Public -Private -Partnersh ip (PPP) initiatives as an important source of transport \\ninfrastructure financing during 7FYP. As noted, this initiative has been slow to start.  Although this has \\ngained some momentum in recent years, the full potential of the PPP initiative remains to be  seen. To \\nachieve sustainable financing of this large transport infrastructure programme, the 8FYP will seek to \\nsharply strengthen the PPP initiative with quality international level staffs and address required legal and \\nincentive issues to draw internatio nal financing from best possible sources. Attention will be given to proper \\nrisk-sharing between public and private sectors in developing financing plans and performance standards, \\ndrawing on the lessons of good practice experience.   \\nDeveloping and implem enting key policies for ensuring quality and reliability of transport services:   \\nDespite progress, the global ranking of the quality of overall transport infrastructure and individual \\ncomponents is low, which lowers the global competitiveness of Bangladesh  and is an important constraint \\nto export diversification and foreign direct investment. The  8FYP will place a strong emphasis on \\nimproving the quality of transport infrastructure and related transport services. Several  constraints reduce \\nquality relating to inadequacy of O&M, lack of service standards, weak safety standards and monitoring, \\npoor accountability for service quality and inadequate monitoring of transport sector related environmental \\nstandards.  The 8FYP will seek to adopt a number of policies to improve infrastructure and service quality. \\nA proper road user charge will be developed that also accounts for congestion, risk of traffic accidents and \\nenvironmental pollution and implemented in a phased manner.  These resources will be used to improve  \\nthe maintenance of roads, bridges and highways. The government has already taken a number of policy \\ninitiatives to reduce road accidents and enforce them with legal sanctions for non -compliance and liability \\nfor accidents.  These will be rigorously enforc ed.  Safety standards for inland water transport, rails and \\nairlines will be reviewed and strengthened as appropriate and fully monitored with legal provisions for non -\\ncompliance. Environmental considerations will be given emphasis in developing transport network \\nincluding roads.  Fossil fuel will be priced efficiently and consideration will be given to the introduction of \\na carbon tax. Clean energy transport options such as electric inter -city trains, electric elevated Mass Rapid \\nTransit (MRT)/Metro Rail a nd Underground MRT/Metro Rail , electric buses, electric cars etc. will be \\npromoted. Service standards will be set for port clearings and rail services in terms of timeliness, online \\nuser-friendly ticketing and clearance documentation options, and in -transi t services.  \\nVehicle exhaust emission standards will be set in line with similar standards as of neighbouring / similar \\ncountries. Policy initiatives will be taken to establish automated vehicle fitness test centres. Considering, \\nmotor vehicle driver as a k ey player, drivers training along with mass road safety awareness programmes  \\nwill be performed on priority basis.    \\n \\n398 \\n Strengthening management capabilities and efficiency of public transport authorities:  The proper \\nimplementation of the proposed transport infr astructure strategy will require substantial institutional \\nreforms in the transport sector.  A particular challenge is to build a quality staff that combines civil servants \\nwith special technical skills and strategic professional staff.  Another challenge is to establish accountability \\nfor performance.  This is a generic challenge for overall public administration during the 8FYP as noted in \\nChapter 2 Part 2 of the Plan dealing with public administration and governance issues.  Several initiatives \\nintroduce d during the 7FYP are underway to strengthen public administration including better staff \\nrecruitment, training, incentives and performance evaluation.  These initiatives will be further strengthened \\nduring the 8FYP. Over time, as Bangladesh develops and i mproves the education and skill base of the \\nlabour force, the quality of public administration will also improve.  \\n6.5.1  Sub-sectoral Strategies  \\nStrategy for road transport  \\nThe specific targets for the road and bridges subsector are shown in Table 6.11. T he main elements of the \\n8FYP strategy for road transport are briefly highlighted below.  \\nTable 6.11: RHD Physical Targets for the 8FYP  \\nPhysical Activities  8FYP Targets  \\nConstruction of 4/6/8 lane roads  550 km  \\nConstruction of new roads lane  150 km \\nImprovem ent/ Rehabilitation of National Highways  1800  km \\nImprovement/ Rehabilitation of Regional & Zi la Highways  12,700 km  \\nConstruction  of bridges/culverts   37,500 meters  \\nReconstruction of bridges/culverts  4,100 meters  \\nConstruction of Flyover/Overpass  11,000 m eters  \\nConstruction of Rigid Pavement  375 km  \\nWeigh Bridge/ Axle Load Control Station  30 number  \\nSource: Road  Transport  and Highways Division  \\nStrengthening project implementation capacity : The top most priority is to strengthen implementation \\ncapacity by focusing on the implementation of core transformational projects under RHD and ensuring their \\ntimely completion (Table 6. 2). Considerable scarce national resources are tied up in these huge capital -\\nintensive projects and their timely implementation us crit ical to ensure that the economy benefits from these \\nprojects as planned and to avoid cost over -runs. Project  implementation capacity of the RHD will be \\nstrengthened through project implementation capacity of the RHD will be strengthened through \\norganizatio nal expansion, employment of qualified engineers & project professionals, through training and \\ntechnical assistance.  Project progress will be reviewed at the Ministerial level on a monthly basis and a 6 -\\nmonth basis at the NEC level.  \\nAs stated in perspecti ve plan, RHD will actively participate in Transport Sector Master Plan 2041. \\nAccordingly, RHD Road Master Plan 2009 -2029 has to be updated & harmonized with these national policy \\ndocuments for ensuring the proper identification of transformational projects  that will achieve the best value \\nfor public money.    \\n \\n399 \\n Consolidation and upgrading of the National Highway Network :  The PP2041 Strategy calls for \\nconsolidating and upgrading of the National Highway Networks through multi -laning of existing highways, \\nby estab lishing access -control long -distance expressways, and by creating service lanes to ease connectivity \\nto local roads. Consistent with this strategy, the first priority would be to ensure the timely completion of \\nthe above -mentioned national highways and ens uring that these roads provide the required service road \\nconnectivity to local roads. New 4 -laning highway project up gradation  will be undertaken selectively based \\nin implementation capacity and available resources.  \\nRoad damage control and ensure efficie nt use : National road networks are a national asset that needs to \\nbe efficiently used with minimum damage.  Accordingly, strict axle load control policy would be \\nestablished and enforced to reduce road damages caused by overloading. Attention  will be given  to develop \\nquality infrastructures with hallmark attribute of high -speed mobility facilities. The targ et would be to \\nachieve 80 -110 km ph design speed with a level of Service ‘B’ for 900 kilometres  of important highway \\ncorridors, which are now operating me rely at 30 -35 kmph. For achieving this, the strategy would be to \\noptimize the intersections to be conflict free on major economic corridors. To ensure better riding quality, \\nthe share of Fair to Good road surfaces will be increased from 81% to 90% for over all RHD Road Network. \\nBypasses around towns would be planned and provided as access -controlled expressway type facilities with \\nentry/exit at predetermined locations. For longevity of road infrastructures, sustainable as well as innovative \\ntechnologies will  be adopted. For example, concrete pavements are encouraged to use in waterlogged \\nsections of highways.  \\nEstablishing road connectivity with major development points : Connectivity with South Asian regional \\nhighways, the economic zone areas, ports, airports,  power stations, inland water transport facilities, rail \\nstations and rail freight centres and major tourist resorts is essential to maximize the benefits of the \\nhighways system. These factors are already playing an important role in the selection of road network \\ndevelopment projects.  The emphasis on these linkages will be further sharpened during the 8FYP.  \\nLagging district connectivity : The poverty discussion in Chapter 4 of Part I showed huge gap in the poverty \\nincidence of districts.  One important fact or is the inadequate connectivity of the lagging districts with the \\ngrowth centres  in leading districts.  So, ensuring inter -district connectivity for all districts that are not \\nconnected through the national highway system is an important priority. This c an be achieved by upgrading \\nexisting roads and bridges and where necessary by creating new expansions. The RHD Road Master Plan \\nwould be used as the guiding document for prioritizing the replacement of PSB, Narrow Bridges & \\nVulnerable Bridges. As indicated  in PP2041, all inter -district roads would eventually be upgraded to at least \\n4-lane facilities. For prioritizing this task, the updated Road Master Plan should be the starting point.  \\nInvestment program for the district roads for the 8FYP will seek to kee p this consideration as a priority.  \\nAdditionally, to reduce the risks of accidents, there should be a separate lane for slow -moving vehicles.  \\nEnsure highway and inter -district road side services:  To ensure proper use and comfort of road users, the \\n8FYP wi ll put emphasis on creating highway and inter -district facilities to provide restroom and food \\nfacilities for travellers  and essential services such as gas stations, emergency repairs, for facilitating \\nhighway mobility. While the private sector will make t he investments, government policy will facilitate \\nthrough land allocations, necessary permits and security facilities.    \\n \\n400 \\n Upgrade Zila and Upazil a roads :  The lagging districts are also constrained by inad equate connectivity \\nbetween Zila and Upazil a roads .  So, the upgrading of all zila and upazi la roads to facilitate easy transport \\nconnectivity between production and consumption centres is an important priority in PP2041 and for the \\n8FYP. This will also motivate and influence location decisions for manufactur ing enterprises and facilitate \\nlabour mobility. These  roads would  be at a minimum 2 lanes, but in some areas where traffic pressure is \\nintense, they would require 4 -lanes  ensuring enough load bearing strengths . To incorporate the non -RHD \\nroads with inadequ ate pavement sub -structures/road geometry, handed over/transferred to RHD road \\nnetwork, will be given priority for upgrading to appropriate level & standard as per RHD specifications. \\nThe on-going  effort to upgrade the sub -standard RHD Zi la Highways to app ropriate level & standard will \\nbe continued throughout the 8FYP.   \\nUp-grading of rural roads : This is an on-going  program and its implementation will be further intensified \\nunder the 8FYP. The PP2041 target is that all village roads would be converted to a sphalt standard with at \\nleast one lane to facilitate rural mobility of passengers and products. The 8FYP will make major efforts to \\npush this important investment consistent with available funding. The road connectivity will be a major \\ninvestment for reduc ing poverty, improving human development, and promoting rural investment in micro \\nand small -scale non -farm enterprises.  \\nImprove road maintenance :  O&M of highway, bridge, culvert and roads are a high priority strategic \\nelement for the road sector.  Financ ing is always a constraint. The development and implementation of a \\nwell-designed road user charges will be instrumental in providing resources for road network upgrading \\nand maintenance. For maintenance of different road network components like highways, bridges, culverts \\nand other road furniture, modern technologies and innovative approaches need to be introduced in order to \\nensure best value for money. For highways and major bridges, the use of tolls will provide funding for \\nO&M. The 8FYP will place emph asis on implementing both these policies through focused studies to \\ndetermine the proper road and toll user charges based on economic principles as well as affordability \\nconcerns.  \\nStrengthen road safety : As noted, the 7FYP took some major policy initiative s to improve road safety \\nconsistent with SDG targets. The  full and proper implementation of the National Road Sector Safety Action \\nPlan (NRSSAP) 2017 -20 will be an important priority for the 8FYP.  Furthermore, in accordance with SDG \\nTarget no. 3.6 the num ber of fatalities due to road traffic accidents on national highways will be reduced \\nby 25% at the end of 8FYP.  \\nBus route Rationalization:  To bring discipline in public transportation (Bus) sector Dhaka Transport \\nCoordination Authority (DTCA) takes an init iative to implement bus route rationalization and company -\\nbased bus operation in Dhaka city.  \\nIntegrated Traffic Management:  In order to reduce traffic congestion in Dhaka city through \\nintersection improvement and Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) is being i mplemented by DTCA. Pilot \\noperation will be started very soon. Under this project, the following Action Plans and Manuals will be \\nprepared by the Japanese expert team which will be finalized based on the information obtained after \\nsetting up IT S. \\n   \\n \\n401 \\n 1. Intersec tion Improvement Manual     \\n2. Guideline for Operation and Installation of Traffic Signal System  \\n3. Guideline for Operation and Installation of CCTV System  \\n4. Comprehensive Traffic Control System Plan  \\n5. Action Plan for Road Traffic Safety Programmes  for Drivers and Pedestrians  \\n6. Action Plan for Design and Enforcement Mechanism of Road Traffic Regulation  \\n \\nStrategy for the Bridges Division  \\nThe strategy for the Bridges Division will be basically similar to that under Road Transport  Division . Given \\nthe highly capital inte nsive and high -cost nature of the underlying investments that often involve \\ninternational contracts and financing including PPP, the three most strategic considerations that will guide \\nthe Bridges Division ’s work program in the 8FYP are:  \\n1) Timely completi on of all on-going  projects :  There are 7 transformational projects in different stages of \\nimplementation  including the Padma Bridge; Dhaka Elevated Expressway PPP Project and the linked PPP -\\nbased Support to Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project ; the Bangaband hu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman tunnel; \\nthe Dhaka -Ashulia Elevated Expressway; and the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Gazipur -Ashulia 4.5 -kilometer \\nelevated expressway  Feasibility Study for the Construction of Subway in Dhaka City .  These are all \\nexpected to be complete d by CY2022.  \\nAll efforts will be made to ensure their timely completion.  A new project was approved at the ECNEC \\nmeeting on March 10, 2020, at a total cost of Tk 1,042 crore for the construction of a 1,690 meter  long \\nbridge over the Paira R iver on Kachua -Betagi -Patuakhali -Lohalia -Kaliya road as part of the development \\nof road communication network in southern region of the country.  \\n2) Turnkey project contracts for internationally funded projects :  Given the fact of capacity constraints \\nleading to delays a nd cost overruns for these expensive projects, the government will increasingly adopt a \\nstrategy of negotiating project implementation for all donor -funded projects on a turnkey basis. The \\ncontracts will have specific performance criteria to prevent delays  and cost over -runs.  \\n3) Sharply expanded PPP capabilities :  The capabilities to negotiate PPP projects involving domestic and \\nforeign funding will be sharply strengthened through upgrading of the PPP cell with internationally \\nqualified and experienced staf f.  \\nThe Bridges Division has identified a number of new high priority transformational projects for the 8FYP \\nincluding Railway Bridge over the Jamuna river, Barisal -Bhola bridge . These project proposals will be \\nreviewed carefully for possible adoption in t he 8FYP and beyond depending upon a proper review of the \\nquality and relevance of these projects for our development, availability of funding, and implementation \\ncapacity. To conserve resources and avoid cost over -runs the policy of not adopting new expens ive projects \\nuntil satisfactory progress with implementation of on-going  projects is firmly established.  \\nStrategy for Railway Development  \\nThe 8FYP will build on the progress achieved under the 7FYP. Buoyed by this success, the Bangladesh \\nRailways has adopt ed ambitious development targets  to play its dynamic role in the Bangladesh \\ndevelopment. The targets for the 8FYP are shown in Box 6. 2.     \\n \\n402 \\n Source: Bangladesh Railways (BR)  \\nTo expand capacity and improve service, the BR has updated its Master Plan to align it in line wit h the \\nPP2041 Vision and also  aligning with the government’s plans & policy statements like 7th Five Years Plan, \\nVision 2021, Delta Plan  2100  etc. to enhance operational capacity, increase market shares  and improve its \\nservices. The updated ma ster plan (July 2016 -June 2045) is divided into six phases of five years each. A \\ntotal of 230 projects with an estimated cost of BDT 5,53,662.00 crore is included in the railway master \\nplan. The targets of the 8FYP shown in Box 5.3 are consistent with the second phase implementation of the \\napproved master plan.  The implementation of the associated investment and operational programmes  of \\nthe BR during the 8FYP will be guided by the following strategic considerations that are consistent with \\nthe PP2041   \\n\\uf0b7 The railway expansion program envisaged in Box 6. 2 will be undertaken with due regards to \\nprojected demand for passenger and freight services with  a view to maximizing the use of \\nassociated capacity expansion.

The major rivers, in turn, provide convenient access to the sea. This massive internet \\nof water connectivity if properly harnessed and nurtured can provide a major development advantage for \\nBangladesh.  The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) examined in detail the constraints faced by the \\nIWT and laid down a detailed strategy and policy frame work for unleashing the true prospects of the IWT \\nsubsector. Consistent  with BDP2100 and the PP2041 strategy, the 8FYP will seek to harness this potential \\nfor both passenger and cargo traffic. The main elements of the strategy for inland water transport in clude:  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish priority routing based on potential passenger and freight traffic flows and develop those \\nnavigability improvements and river port infrastructures.  \\n\\uf0b7 Sharply improve the navigability of river routes through strategic dredging, river training , and \\nbundling  as emphasized in BDP2100.  \\n\\uf0b7 Give priority to inter -regional river connectivity to facilitate trade, commerce and tourism.  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrate IWT with other transport modes to maximize the benefits of IWT.    \\n \\n404 \\n \\uf0b7 Strengthen river transport safety standards by  setting proper standards and ensuring full \\ncompliance. Particular attention would be given to ensure the river -worthiness of vessels, adequacy \\nof safety equipment including radio communications, and compliance with passenger load \\nregulations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Vessel worth iness licensing would ensure minimum service facilities and standards of all vessels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) will be strengthened with technical staff \\nand qualified inspectors to administer all licensing functions efficiently a nd on time.  Special \\nattention will be given to governance improvements.  \\n\\uf0b7 The capacity of BIWTA to undertake hydrological surveys, conduct river training and implement \\ndredging operations will be expanded through upgrading the managerial and technical staff  and \\ninternational training. Side by side, the private sector will be invited to participate in these \\noperations on a PPP basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Given the large need for resources, a proper balance between the public and private sector will be \\nmaintained. Much  of the infr astructure will be provided by the public sector but most of the \\npassenger and freight services will be provided by the private sector. ADP allocations will give \\npriority to the development of IWT infrastructure  \\n\\uf0b7 River port  facilities will be sharply improv ed with modern service standards for passengers, \\ndocking and unloading services for cargo including container cargo, storage facilities and security \\nand rescue services. International river ports of call will also provide customs and inspection \\nservices as  relevant.  \\n\\uf0b7 Pricing policies for passenger and cargo will be commercially determined with a view to enabling \\na reasonable rate of return on investment.  \\n \\nStrategy for Shipping  \\nThe main objective of the shipping sub -sector during the 8FYP is to expand the ca pability of the Bangladesh \\nShipping Corporation to handle a larger share of the Bangladesh international trade than presently. \\nBangladesh  international trade has been growing and linked to that shipping demand has grown manifold. \\nYet the BSC capacity to pr ovide efficient shipping services has been limited. Given  the need to diversify \\nthe sources of export earnings, the export diversification strategy of the 8FYP envisages a growing share \\nof Non -factor exports in total exports.  A n important component of tha t are earnings from shipping.  To \\nachieve this target, the BSC has to be modernized with an expanded fleet, competent management and \\nquality staff.  A combination of purchase and lease operations will be used to expand fleet capacity. Through \\nthe Chittagon g Marine Academy, Bangladesh produces internationally qualified merchant navy \\nprofessionals who are in demand in international shipping lines. The 8FYP will strive to encourage these \\nqualified personnel to seek employment in BSC fleets at internationally c ompetitive salaries.  BSC \\nmanagement will be upgraded with technical competent and business -oriented professionals to be able to \\nhandle international shipping consignments efficient and effectively. Staff training will be emphasized.  In \\ninternational shipp ing private sector may also be encouraged to participate.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n405 \\n Strategy for Air Transport  \\n The growing demand for domestic and International  air and cargo traffic calls substantial  investments in \\nconstruction of new airports, expansion and modernization of ex isting airports, improvement in connecting \\ninfrastructure (road, metro, sea link, etc.) and better airspace management. The performance in the 7FYP \\nwas mixed owing to financing and implementation capacity constraints.  The 8FYP will seek to \\nsubstantially s trengthen and upgrade the air transport industry as Bangladesh seeks to attain UMIC status. \\nConsistent with PP2041strategy, the 8FYP will adopt the following strategies to deal with the emerging \\nsituation in the aviation sector:  \\n\\uf0b7 Build a new international a irport to serve the growing air traffic demand of the country.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade and modernise all existing airports by creating additional runways and taxiways; \\naugmenting gate and apron capacity to accommodate more aircraft; increase terminal capacity to \\naccommoda te more passengers; improve ground traffic management and ancillary aviation \\nprocesses to ensure quick aircraft turnarounds; improve air traffic and air space management \\npractices and new radar technology; and p rovide complementary services such as fuel su pply, \\npassenger and luggage handling, warehousing, workshop facilities, hangars etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen security in the airport through the introduction of a modern and smart security system.   \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade non -operational air -strips in the places of economic significa nce such as ports, tourist \\nplaces and industrial clusters.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen land transport connectivity to the airports to maximize the benefits of air services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish a specialised air cargo terminal to handle growing air cargo volume and reduce congestion  \\nand delays. This will particularly benefit urgent shipments of exports and imports.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade air navigation services (ANS) to build seamless air space with expanded capacity and \\nsafety. Future ANS infrastructure would move towards greater integration and a utomation with the \\nimplementation of state -of-the-art technologies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities and services to save cost and time in a highly \\ncompetitive market.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen human resource development in this skill -intensive and co mpetitive line of business.  \\n\\uf0b7 Attract private sector participation in airport development.  \\n\\uf0b7 Institute appropriate cost recovery policies for airport services. Airport like seaport is a commercial \\nenterprise and will be run and managed on a commercial basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the performance of the national carrier Bangladesh Biman through professional \\nmanagement and technically qualified staff who understand the airline business with a view to \\noperating BB as a truly commercial enterprise and earn sizable profit.  \\nStrategy for Maritime Port Development   \\nThe trade to GDP ratio is projected to expand further substantially during the 8FYP, requiring strong \\nattention to expanded and efficient port services.  The Chittagong Port Authority has built up a strong record \\nof performance improvement including financial performance that sets it apart from other SOEs.  Even, so \\nthe global trade logistic performance comparison shows that the efficiency of port services is lower than in \\ncompetitor countries thereby lowering trade c ompetitiveness.  The 8FYP will put strong emphasis on further   \\n \\n406 \\n improving the efficiency of the port performance to improve the competitiveness of the Bangladesh \\neconomy. Specifically, the 8FYP strategy for the maritime port subsector would involve the follo wing steps . \\n\\uf0b7 Emphasis will be placed on removing all the constraints to the use of the Mongla Port to its full capacity \\nthrough a combination of investments in strategic dredging and investments in port equipment and \\nfacilities to support expanded and effic ient cargo handling.  \\n\\uf0b7 The investment programmes  for the expansion of Chittagong Port capacity will be fast tracked along \\nwith other investments for expanding container traffic handling and management.  \\n\\uf0b7 Completion of minimum 16.0  meter draft deep sea port at Matarbari, Cox’s Bazar . \\n\\uf0b7 The investment programmes  for the Pyra Port will be fast tracked for speedy completion of all required \\nphysical work to enable service by 2022.   \\n\\uf0b7 Each port would focus on the improvement of productivity – both ship berth -day and gan g-shift output \\nfurther through modernisation, induction of more sophisticated equipment in handling cargo, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Handling operations in selected areas will gradually be outsourced/  privatised for injecting more \\ncompetition and increasing output.  \\n\\uf0b7 Efforts wou ld be made for full mechanization of cargo handling operation and movement in major Ports.  \\n\\uf0b7 The storage area in the ports will be expanded.  \\n\\uf0b7 Formulation of Private Sector Port Policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Efforts would be made to reduce pre -berthing detention and to improve turn  -time of vessels through \\nminimization of both port and non -port related factors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Required dredging to allow handling of bigger shipping will be carried out.  \\n\\uf0b7 Terminal capacity for handling higher cargo off -loading will be expanded.  \\n\\uf0b7 Capacity to handle large  container traffic will be expanded by constructing deep water -container hub ports.  \\n\\uf0b7 Inter-modal transport connectivity with ports will be ensured for speedy forward transport to the final \\ndestination of imports as well as easy transit factory gate to port for exports.  \\n\\uf0b7 Modern cargo handling techniques would be introduced to improve port performance in the major ports, \\nparticularly in the dry bulk cargo, conventional and unitized general cargo trades.  \\n\\uf0b7 Port service efficiency and productivity will be enhanced  by introducing of state -of-the-art \\ntechnology/internet to implement integrated Port Operations System and to move towards paperless \\nregime so as to reduce dwell time and also reduce transaction cost to the users. The major areas where \\nsuch automation is a imed at include: Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS); Information \\nTechnology in Scientific Application, the Cargo/Container handling operations and non -operation area; \\nSurveillance System and Safety & Security System; and Electronic Commerce (EC)/Elect ronic Data \\nInterchange (EDI).  \\nStrategy for Land ports  \\nGiven their importance for regional trade with neighbours , especially India, the 8FYP will seek to build on \\nthe progress made in the 7FYP and further improve the quality and lower transaction costs of l and port \\nfreight. The upgrading effort of exiting land ports with modern facilities and use of digital technology will \\ncontinue. Freight  clearing time lines will be reduced through governance improvements, stronger \\nsupervision, reduction in paper work and use of ICT. Land port  clearance procedures in Europe and North \\nAmerica will be studied to see how these experiences can be used to i mprove land port efficiency       \\n \\n407 \\n Strategies for Urban Transport Development  \\nThe main objective of the 8FYP urban transport st rategy will be to support sustainable urban development. \\nThe strategy for urban transport would aim at reducing the traffic congestion and to improve the \\nenvironment, improving transport and traffic infrastructure so as to meet existing and potential deman ds, \\nand developing an integrated and balanced system in which all modes (motorized and non -motorized) can \\nperform efficiently and each mode can fulfil its appropriate role in the system. The main elements of an \\nurban transport strategy are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Completion of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT ) Metro Rail, both elevated and underground rail, initially in \\nDhaka City  and its adjoining areas .    \\n\\uf0b7 Provision of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) that is characterized by dedicated lanes for rapid movement of \\nbuses for all divisional cities.   \\n\\uf0b7 Provision of large electric bus/pollution free bus operated by BRTC phasing out other small buses from \\nthe cities for rapid movement in all divisional cities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Creating special lanes for pedestrians and cyclists.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting high efficiency and alternative  fuel vehicles.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduce Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) initially in Dhaka and then extend to other \\nmetropolises.  The major application areas of ITS technology include electronic road pricing, traffic \\nmanagement, integrated ticketing systems for  different public transport modes, and traveller  \\ninformation . By 2031, all the major cities and the national highway networks of Bangladesh should be \\nbrought under Intelligent Transportation Systems.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening linkages with cities and towns around Metr opolitan Areas through Bus Rapid Transit \\n(BRT) and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT /Metro Rail). The emphasis would be placed on coordinated \\ndevelopment of land use and transportation planning in order to facilitate access to such basic \\nnecessities as workplaces a nd socio -economic facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Commercial parking facilities will be encouraged through private investment. All parking regulations \\nwill be strictly enforced with penalties for non -compliance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Time of day use restrictions will be introduced in heavily cong ested roads. Consideration will be given \\nto introduce entry fee during peak hours for heavily travelled roads.  \\n\\uf0b7 The emphasis would be given on the introduction of pedestrian roads in Dhaka City and then extend to \\nother Metropolises.  \\n6.6 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND  POSTAL SERVICES  \\nThe entire world is passing through a digital revolution where every facet of the citizen’s individual and \\ncollective activities are dependent on digital connectivity and services. The intelligent networks and \\nterminals, ultra -reliable low  latency communication, real time processing and the capacity of managing \\ncommunications of trillions of devices and endpoints are the key drivers of worldwide digitization. As the \\nworld is forwarding to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the role of digital technology is rapidly \\nshifting from a driver of efficiency to an enabler of fundamental innovation and disruption. The \\ntelecommunications industry is at the forefront of this transformation through the digital ecosystem which \\nis providing the funda mental building blocks i.e. access, intelligence, interconnectivity and applications \\nthat are enabling digital revolution to take place. The Covid -19 pandemic has shown the utmost necessity   \\n \\n408 \\n of being digital. At present all the social, cultural, economic an d governance activities has been forced to \\nshift in the digital world. Though globally the wave of digital transformations in the enterprises and \\ngovernance began several years earlier, the unprecedented experience of Covid -19 will further accelerate \\nthe transformation. Undoubtedly digital connectivity and services would be the prime factor for socio -\\neconomic development in the post pandemic world.  \\nThe visions associated with 5G have initiated a total paradigm shift of using digital devices, computing and \\nconnectivity which redefined the way of building an innovating knowledge economy.4 Total digitalization \\nis required in every sector to harness the full potential of technological advancements and to integrate the \\ncountry with 4IR. On-going  disruptive innova tions have already blurred the boundaries between the \\nphysical, digital, and biological worlds. Therefore, a complete fresh look in the policies, plans, legislations, \\nprocedures, management criteria, Human resources development and institutional framework is required \\nfor the future connectivity and holistic adoption of digital technologies and processes.  \\nPosts and Telecommunications division is playing the pivotal role in achieving ‘Digital Bangladesh’ by \\nensuring the development of modern infrastructure a nd services as well as the appropriate governance of \\nthe related sectors.  The division works closely with the associated departments, regulators, infrastructure \\nand service providers, Over the Top service providers, Content providers, device and equipment  importers \\nand manufacturers, retailers, value chain players including distributors, investors, academia and various \\nother stakeholders both in public and private sectors. The legacy notion needs to be changed considering \\nthe sector’s all -encompassing cont ribution to other sectors and as the backbone of the upcoming 4IR.  \\nIt is expected that the digital infrastructure and services will have at least 6% direct contribution in the GDP \\nof Bangladesh during 2041. It is foreseen that 100% digital device will be manufactured in Bangladesh and \\nwill contribute in country’s export earnings. The contribution of Digital products and services will be 10% \\nof the total national export earnings as Bangladesh will be a major shareholder of the global knowledge \\neconomy by 20 41. The development objectives, plans and strategies stipulated in this chapter have been set \\nout to achieve the telecom sector targets as well as to support other sectors integrating with the Fourth \\nIndustrial Revolution through a true digital transformat ion.  \\n6.6.1 Organization of Post s and Telecommunications Division (PTD)  \\nThe Posts and Telecommunications D ivision carries out its duties through various departments, regulator \\nand different organizations in private and public sector. A glimpse of the insti tutional framework of the \\nposts and telecommunications sector is presented in the Figure  6.1.  \\n  \\n                                                     \\n4  ITU, 2017. 5G Basics.    \\n \\n409 \\n Figure  6.1: Institutional Framework of Postal and Telecommunication Infrastructure and Services \\nin Bangladesh.  \\n \\na) Institutional framework of the postal secto r: \\nThe postal department formally started its journey in 1898 in the British ruled India through the Post Office \\nAct. The Act is adopted in the independent Bangladesh to run the activities of the Department of Posts. At \\nthe time of the creation of the post al service, the main activity of the Department was to collect, transport \\nand deliver personal and official letters. Subsequently Money Order and various other modern services \\nwere introduced. Now the Department of Posts is gradually updating and upgrading  the traditional postal \\nservices through ICT based modernization process. At present the organization provides services through \\ncountrywide 9,886 post offices including the hard to reach areas.  \\nIn order to regulate the operation of the Courier Service bus iness and to issue licenses for Courier Service \\noperators, the sections 4 and 58 of the Post Office Act, 1898 were amended in 2010. The Mailing Operator \\nand Courier Service Licensing Authority are formed in 2013 following the amendment of the Act.  \\nb) Insti tutional framework of the telecommunication sector  \\nDepartment of Telecommunications was established in 2015. The function of the department is to support \\nthe government in policy formulation and implementation and creating an environment for providing \\naffordable and quality telecommunication services in the country through incorporating institutional \\ndevelopment and modern technology.  \\nA new national telecommunication policy has been formulated and published in 2018 after 20 years of the \\nfirst one. The visio n of the policy is to provide affordable and universally accessible quality \\ntelecommunication services to support the nation’s sustainable development goals and to integrate the \\n  \\n \\n410 \\n country with the global knowledge economy. Some major institutional reform env isioned in the policy \\nwhich will be implemented gradually to support the growing needs of the sector.  \\n6.6.2  Progress during t he 7FYP  \\nPosts and Telecommunications infrastructures and services are growth drivers and input to the other sectors \\nof the economy . The achievements in these sectors were beyond the goals specified in the seventh five -year \\nplan. The sectoral development policies and programmes  were undertaken as per need of the market and \\nglobal technology trends to fulfil  the ‘Digital Bangladesh’ go al anticipated in ‘Vision 2021’. Some of the \\nnotable achievements during 2015 to 2020 include - \\na) Ensuring connectivity, affordability and quality of service  \\n \\nThe tele density of the country has exceeded 100% during the last five years. In this period the int ernet \\nusers have been  doubled by adding more than 5 c rore subscribers. At the same time, the international \\nbandwidth usage has been increased by about 7 times which confirms the greater participation of the people \\nand businesses in the global knowledge eco nomy. At present Bangladesh is the fifth largest mobile market \\nin Asia -Pacific region and ninth in the world in terms of unique subscribers.5    \\nTable 6. 12: Improvement in Digital Connectivity and Affordability  \\nIndicator  June 2010  June 2015  February 2020  \\nTeledensity  41.2%  81.93%  101.41%  \\nCellular Mobile subscriptions (2G/ \\n3G/4G)  5.99 Crore  12.68 Crore  16.61 Crore  \\nInternet Subscriptions  0.7 Crore  \\n(mobile internet 98%)  4.83 Crore  (mobile \\ninternet 97%)  9.99 Crore  \\n(mobile internet 94%)  \\nInternet Density  2.5%  30.56%  58.91%  \\nInternet Bandwidth Charge/Mbps  18,000 BDT  625 BDT  285 BDT  \\nUse of International Internet \\nBandwidth  7.5 Gbps  234 Gbps  1,600 Gbps  \\nSource: BTRC, PTD  \\n \\nb) Infrastructure development and adaptation of new tech nologies  \\ni) Communication Satellite: The first communication satellite of Bangladesh \\'Bangabandhu \\nSatellite -1\\' was launched successfully on 12 May 2018 using the Falcon 9 launch vehicle from the \\nlaunch -pad LC -39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. With this, Bangladesh emerged as the 57th \\ncountry  in the world having its own satellite. The satellite is providing telecommunication and \\nbroadcasting services as well as a variety of sophisticated digital services across the country \\nincluding the hilly regions, the riverine chars and the islands. There are opportunities to extend \\nservices of BS -1 in other countries of South Asia, portion of south -east Asia and Stan -countries. \\nSignificant amount of foreign exchange is being conserved as 33 private television channels and 4 \\nchannels of Bangladesh Televisio n have started broadcasting through ‘Bangabandhu Satellite -1’ \\ninstead of foreign satellite service providers. Moreover,  the native DTH (Direct to Home) operators \\nare providing services using BS -1. Besides, two ground control stations and satellite ground s tations \\n                                                     \\n5  GSMA. (2018). Country Overview: Bangladesh, Mobile Industry Driving Growth and Enabling Digital Inclusion .   \\n \\n411 \\n have been set up in Gazipur and Betbunia for satellite management and related services. Bangladesh \\nCommunication Satellite Company Limited has been formed in 2017 to operate the satellite and \\nprovide services at home and abroad.  \\n \\nii) Fourth Generation Cellular Mobile Service: 4G licenses have been issued to four cellular mobile \\nservice providers in 2018 in order to provide high speed mobile broadband throughout the country. \\nFor the purpose, technology -neutral spectrum from 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz band hav e been \\nallotted in favour  of the service providers at a price 31 million USD/MHz and 27 Million \\nUSD/MHz, respectively. At present, 4G service has been extended to all Upazila levels and rural \\nareas with more than 21 million subscriptions.  \\n \\niii) Domestic transmi ssion backbone: The project titled “Optical Fibre  Cable Network Development \\nProject in 1000 Union Parishads” has been completed in December 2016 by BTCL. Through this \\nproject, about 8000 km of optical fibre  cable has been laid in 1,212 unions from 114 Upaz ilas in \\n64 districts. More than 9000 km optical fibre  cables and related equipment have been installed in \\n349 Upazilas of 64 districts under the “Upazila level optical network development” project of \\nBTCL.  \\n \\niv) With the goal of expanding high speed internet s ervice in marginal rural areas, Info -Sarkar (Phase -\\n3) project has been undertaken by the government.  The infrastructure development activities under \\nthis project include establishing 19,500 km optical fibre  network in 2,600 Unions; \\nestablishing/expanding DWDM network in 63 Districts and 48 Upazilas; ensuring transmission \\nnetworks of 10 Gbps at Upazila level and 100 Gbps at District level; establishing Point of Presence \\n(POP) in 2600 Unions and VPN / MPLS service in 1600 offices at different levels of Bangl adesh \\nPolice; and establishing Network Monitoring System (NMS) for network monitoring and \\noperations.  In addition, the project titled ‘Establishment of ICT Network to Remote Areas \\n(Connected Bangladesh)’ is being implemented to provide internet connectivit y in further 777 \\nUnions. The project is set to be completed within December 2021.  \\n \\nv) International transmission network: The cable landing station of country\\'s second submarine \\ncable SEA -ME-WE-5 has been set up at Kuakata of Patuakhali District. At present t he total \\nbandwidth capacity of the existing two submarine cables is 2,750 Gbps. About 60% of the country\\'s \\ninternational bandwidth demand is currently being met through submarine cables and the rest are \\nthrough seven International Terrestrial Cable (ITC) o perators. Considering the growing demand of \\ninternational bandwidth, MoU has been already signed with SEA -ME-WE-6 Submarine Cable \\nConsortium for connection with the third submarine cable to add additional 12 Tbps capacity which \\nis expected to be operationa l by 2025.  \\nvi) Expansion and up gradation  of access networks: The “Modernization of Telecommunication \\nNetwork for Digital Connectivity” project is being implemented by BTCL. Under the project, the \\nFixed Access Network and BTCL\\'s IP Network will be upgraded thr ough IMS (IP Multi -Media \\nSubsystem) Platform, FTTx Technology\\'s AGW (Access Gateway ), GPON (Gigabit -capable \\nPassive Optical Networks) and MDU (Multi Dwelling Unit) at three locations of the country. The \\nproject \"Establish Optical Fibber  Cable Network in Al l Government Colleges / Universities and \\nTraining Institutes\" has provided high -speed internet broadband facility to 587 Government \\nuniversities/colleges and training institutes using BTCL\\'s existing optical fibre  cable network.   \\n \\n412 \\n Teletalk is providing 3G mo bile services across the country through 4,936 2G BTS and 3,909 3G \\nBTS (Node B) and 2,348 4G Node -B in all districts and 48 Upazilas. Teletalk is providing e -services \\nto the citizens in the areas of public examination results, university admissions and pub lication of results, \\nmedical, education, disaster management, entertainment, utility bill payment etc.  \\n \\nvii) MNP, Tower Sharing and TVAS: Mobile Number Portability Services (MNPS) license has been \\nissued in favour  of an operator in 2018 to provide the facility to avail the services of any other \\nmobile operator while keeping the mobile number unchanged. In the same year tower sharing \\nlicense has been issued in favour  of 4 (four) operators in order to ensure proper utilization of tower \\nresources, reducing demand f or electricity connection and cultivable lands and to ensure health and \\nenvironmental protection. Regulatory Guidelines for Issuance of Registration Certificate for \\nProviding Telecommunication Value Added Services (TVAS) have been issued in 2017 to provide  safe, \\nuseful, efficient, universal and affordable Telecom Value Added Services to the general public.  \\n \\nviii) Mobile handset ecosystem:  NOC Automation and IMEI Database have been set up in BTRC in \\n2019 for the protection of government revenue and facilitation of  legal mobile handset imports \\nand preparation and preservation of IMEI database. The IMEIs of each mobile handset, initially \\nimported legally from abroad and locally produced in the country, are being stored in a database \\nsystem called NAID (NOC Automation  and IMEI Database).  \\n \\nix) Voice Call and Internet Bandwidth rate:  The approved call rate for mobile phones in Bangladesh \\nhas been fixed from a minimum of Tk 0.45 to a maximum of Tk 2.00. The average call rate of \\nvarious packages has now come down to below Tk 0 .50. In order to bring the price of internet \\nbandwidth within the purchasing power of the people and reducing digital divide and create \\nopportunities for development and employment of digital services, the monthly wholesale charge \\nfor internet bandwidth ha s been gradually reduced from Tk 27,000 in 2009 to Tk 285 in 2019. The \\nmobile voice call rate was the 3rd lowest and broadband internet tariff was the 4th lowest according \\nto the Global Information Technology Report, 2016 published by World Economic Forum.   \\n \\nx) Quality of Service:  QoS guideline has been formulated and being enforced in order to improve the \\nquality of telecommunication services. The issues related to Call drop, increase in network quality, \\nclosure of unwanted packages by customers, prevention o f copyright infringement etc. are \\nmonitored regularly by BTRC.  \\n \\n(c) Safety and security in the use of digital media and technology  \\n(i) Digital threat mitigation:  \\'Cyber Threat Detection and Response\\' project has been implemented by \\nDepartment of Telecommunications (DoT) to prevent internet users from accessing \\nwebsites/content that are inconsistent with the country\\'s values, including porn and gambling sites.  \\n \\n(ii) Biometric registration of mobile subscriptions: The SIM / RUIM re -registration process verifying \\nthe customer\\'s information with the national identity card in biometric system has been completed \\non 31st May 2016. In parallel biometric registration has been  made mandatory for new connections. \\nAs a result, criminal activities such as mobile phone threats, extortion, militant financing, illegal \\ncall termination, etc. have been greatly reduced.  \\n   \\n \\n413 \\n (iii) Coordination with global online service providers:  Initiatives hav e been taken with the authorities \\nof Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other online media to prevent, monitor and counter harmful \\ncontent such as anti -social and anti -social propaganda, rumours  and religious extremism on social \\nnetworking sites.  \\n \\n(d) Indigen ous manufacturing of digital equipment and accessories  \\ni) Optical fibre  Cable, HDPE duct: Apart from producing telephone copper cables and wires, \\nBangladesh Cable Shilpa Limited (BCSL) has started production of optical fibre  since 2012, which \\nis playing an  important role in developing the infrastructure for Digital Bangladesh. Steps have \\nbeen taken to install one new high speed sheathing line machine to increase the annual production \\ncapacity of the optical fibre  cable plant to 9,000 km. The machine is expe cted to be operational by \\nJune 2020. Besides, commercial production of HDPE Silicon Duct has been started from September \\n2017. Up gradation  of the duct plant is on-going  to increase the annual production capacity to 3,500 \\nkm. \\n \\nii) Electrical Conductors, Ca bles and wires:  BCSL has completed the installation of the plant to \\nmanufacture electrical overhead conductors, service drop cables and bare/ insulated wire with an \\nannual production capacity of 2,400 metric tons (600 km per month).  \\n \\niii) Telephone sets, PABX, Laptops and other telecom accessories: Telephone Silpa Shangstha (TSS) \\nis manufacturing/assembling Digital telephone sets, Digital PABX, Laptop, Multi -functional \\ndigital energy meter and battery/charger for mobile telephone sets to support the needs of \\ntelecommunication/ICT sector.  \\n \\n(e) Modernization of postal services and expansion of services through IT  \\ni) Postal Digital Centres : Under the project titled “Post E -Centre  for Rural Community”, 8,000 rural \\npost offices and 500 Upazila post offices across the country have been converted into digital \\ncentres . \\n \\nii) Up gradation  of postal systems and services: Under the “Information Technology Based Rural \\nPost Office Construction” project 590 post office buildings have been rebuilt and 1,263 post offices \\nhave been  repaired. Automation project of the Department of Posts had been undertaken in order \\nto bring 71 main post offices, 13 mail and sorting offices and 200 Upazila post offices and town \\nsub post offices under ICT based automation. Furthermore, 14 new modern m ail processing centres  \\nwill be set up to provide maximum service to the postal customers by replacing the 40/50 - year old \\ntraditional mail processing centres  with a combination of article, sorting and delivery system \\nthrough the implementation of the “Mail  Processing and Logistics Service Centre  project”. To \\nreduce the dependency on the railway and leased vehicles in the postal transport and distribution \\nsystem, 116 vehicles of different categories have been procured under the project titled \\n“Strengthening the Postal Transport System”.  \\n \\niii) Digital Financial Inclusion:  Postal Money (Dak Taka) has been introduced through post offices \\nto ensure balance transactions for the people who are deprived of banking facilities. The electronic/ \\nmobile money order service ha s been extended to 2,650 different categories of post offices across   \\n \\n414 \\n the country. In addition, Postal cash card service is being provided in 638 post offices across the \\ncountry including all District and Upazila post offices. To enhance the financial inclu sion in the \\ncounty, Digital Financial Service ‘Nagad’ has been introduced in 2019 which has been able to \\nsecure a significant market share within a very short time.  \\n(f) Formulation/ amendment of laws/rules/policies/guidelines during 2015 -2020  \\ni) Bangladesh T elecommunication Regulatory Commission (Significant Market Capacity) \\nRegulations, 2017.  \\nii) National Telecommunication Policy, 2018.  \\niii) National Broadband Policy, 2009 (Revised 2013, 2016, 2017).  \\niv) 4G / LTE Cellular Mobile Phone Operator Regulatory and Licensing Gu idelines, 2018.  \\nv) Mobile Number Portability Regulatory and Licensing Guidelines, 2018.  \\nvi) Telecommunication Value Added Service Registration and Regulatory Guidelines, 2018.  \\nvii) Tower Sharing Regulatory and Licensing Guidelines, 2018.  \\n \\n(g) Institutional reforms in the telecommunications sector  \\ni) Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Limited has been formed in 2016 to manage and \\ncontrol the communication satellites including providing and marketing the satellite services.  \\n \\nii) The Department of Telecommunications was formed in 2015 in order to provide technical support, \\nassist the government in policy formulation and implementation and create skilled manpower in \\nthe telecommunication sector.  \\n \\n(h) Contribution of Posts and Telecommunications Sectors to the National Econ omy  \\n(i) Impact on GDP: During the last five years posts and telecommunications sectors have been able to \\nmaintain the growth rate alongside with the other sectors of the economy as shown in Table  6.13. \\nTable  6.13: The direct contribution of Posts and Tele communications in GDP  \\n(Constant Prices; Base Year: 2005 -06) \\nFiscal Year  GDP  \\n(Crore Taka)  GDP Growth \\nRate  (%) GDP From Post and \\nTelecom  \\n(Crore Taka)  Posts and Telecom \\nGrowth Rate (%)  Post & Telecom \\nGDP Share (%)  \\n2015 -16 883,540  7.11 22,233  6.81 2.62 \\n2016 -17 947,900  7.28 23,785  6.98 2.61 \\n2017 -18 1,022,437  7.86 25,339  6.53 2.58 \\n*2018 -19 1,105,793  8.15 27,397  8.12 2.58 \\nSource: Bangladesh Economic Review, 2018; Ministry of Finance.   *Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.  \\nAccording to the assessment of the Bure au of statistics, the segregated value addition by the Posts and \\nTelecommunications sectors are shown in the Tabl e 6.14.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n415 \\n Table  6.14: Summary of Value Addition by Posts and Telecommunications Sector  \\n(Constant Prices; Base Year: 2005 -06; Taka million ) \\nSectors/ Sub -sectors  FY 2014 -15 FY 2015 -16 FY 2016 -17 FY2017 -18 FY 2018 -19 \\nPost and Courier Activity  4709  5657  6009  6502  7040  \\nBangladesh Post Office  2728  3605  3883  4300  4759  \\nCourier Service  1981  2052  2126  2202  2281  \\nTelecommunication  204413  217762  233042  248216  268304  \\nBangladesh T&T  9165  9585  10117  8201  8201  \\nMobile Phone  185223  197021  210464  226114  244597  \\nOthers  10025  11156  12460  13902  15506  \\nSource: Statistical Yearbook Bangladesh, 2019; Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics  \\n(ii) Impact on Foreign Direct Inves tment: Over the last two decades, telecommunication sector is a major \\nsource of foreign direct investment in the country.

Digital transformation has become a universal phenomenon \\nwhich focuses on smart integration of digital technologies, processes and competencies across all levels \\nand fun ctions of society, government, organizations, industry or ecosystem in a staged way . To be \\ntransformational, digita l services need to be personalis ed, presence less, cashless, paperless, integrated and \\nconsent -based. Bangladesh needs to develop specific ca pabilities and core modernization to be able to \\ndeliver such transformational digital services that will lead to improvement in quality of life and wellbeing \\nand the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).  \\nA comprehensive Digital Transformation  Strategy (DTS) is very much essential for Bangladesh containing \\nstrategic vision for the country’s digital transformation, clear priorities and objectives, measurable targets, \\nsufficient budget and thorough monitoring and evaluation criteria. A phase by p hase implementation \\nroadmap also needs to be prepared in this regard.  \\nTelecommunication industry has a crucial role in digital transformation. But at first transformation requires \\nin the telecommunication industry itself. As a part of the transformation, t he Communications Services \\nProviders (CSPs) need to evolve as Digital Services Providers (DSPs). Digital transformation journeys are \\nspanned over multiple fronts due to rapidly evolving technologies. Figure  6.2. summaris es the essential \\ncharacteristics of a Digital Service Provider.    \\n \\n417 \\n Figure  6.2: Summary of the Essential Characteristics of a Digital Service Provider.  \\nSource: LM Ericsson  \\nb) Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)  \\nTelecommunication industry is at the epicentre of the 4IR by providing high -speed di gital connectivity and \\nmany of the smart technologies and services at its core. Access, interconnectivity and applications are the \\nenablers of the digital revolution which is being provided by the telecom ecosystem. However, it will be \\nnecessary to prepare  the telecommunication industry to fuel other sector s in harnessing the potential of 4IR. \\nNew business models will be required in telecommunication industry in order to leverage emerging \\ndisruptive technologies and for that network transformation will be n ecessary. Operators of the digital age \\nrequire corporate cultural change along with new organizational structures including strong collaboration \\nwith vertical industries and internet platforms. Above all , reforms in existing policy and regulatory models \\nwill be required for the digitization of the country’s industrial sectors.  \\niv) Future networks and 5G  \\nNumerous factors have introduced new requirements to the digital networks in recent years. The industrial \\neconomy nowadays is gradually being reliant on digital  infrastructure to create and connect complex \\nnetworks of devices, locations, systems, assets and people. Digital connectivity requirements are emerging \\npertaining to future society along with sustainability and environmental considerations. New applicatio n \\nareas of digital technologies and networks such as Internet of Things, smart grids, smart cities and transport, \\nsmart agriculture, cloud computing are advancing in a very fast pace worldwide. Advancements in silicon, \\noptical and computing technology has made possible to meet the future requirements of the networks with \\na substantially reduced cost of the equipment. Considering the future demands, Recommendation ITU -T \\nY.3001 (05/2011) has been introduced which are illustrated in the Figure  6.3.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n418 \\n  \\nFigure  6.3: Four Objectives and Twelve Design Goals of Future Networks  \\n \\n     Source: ITU Recommendation ITU -T Y.3001  \\nBased upon the visions of the future networks, ITU is promoting implementation of the fifth generation of \\nmobile communication (5G) by 2020. Te lecom service providers of the leading countries in digital economy \\nhave already started migration to the 5G networks. While 2G, 3G and 4G were primarily radio focused, 5G \\nrepresents an entire system with radio, telecom core, and OSS all transformed to sup port new requirements. \\nNew radio technologies, virtualized cloud -based core, end -to-end management and orchestration to \\nfacilitate automation and new concepts like network slicing are involved with the system. The \\ncharacteristics of 5G networks are as foll ows:  \\n(i) Up-to 20 Gbps data rate;  \\n(ii) 99.999% reliability;  \\n(iii) 99.999% availability (highest 53 minutes downtime in a year);  \\n(iv) 100% coverage;  \\n(v) 1000x bandwidth per unit area;  \\n(vi) High speed mobility (about 500 km/h);  \\n(vii) 90% reduction in network energy usage;  \\n(viii) Up-to 10 -year batter y life for low power IoT device;  \\n(ix) Stronger subscriber authentication, user privacy and network security;  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n419 \\n Figure 6. 4: Speed of 5G Compared to Other Technologies  \\n \\n \\nBangladesh adopted 3G and 4G technology at a belated stage. The same is true for submarine cable \\nconnectivity. Deployment of 5G network infrastructure and services in right time is very crucial for \\nBangladesh to integrate the country with fourth industrial revolution and to carry forw ard the ‘Digital \\nBangladesh’.   \\nd) Need for increasing domesti c and international backbone transmission capacity  \\nThe requirement of international connectivity is growing rapidly with the expansion of the digital economy \\nin the country. At present, country’s need for international digital connectivity is entirely bein g fulfilled by \\ninternational submarine and terrestrial cables. As Bangladesh is making great strides economically, the need \\nfor international digital connectivity is also increasing. For instance, the growth in utilization of internet \\nbandwidth in Banglade sh for the year 2017, 2018 and 2019 was around 78%, 72% and 53% respectively.  \\nThe per user international bandwidth usage in Bangladesh currently stands at around 15 kbps. Whereas the \\nworld average of international bandwidth usage per internet user was 76.6  kbps and Asia -Pacific average \\nis 61.7 kbps.7 It reveals that Bangladesh will require a substantial amount international connectivity by \\n2025. Bangladesh has already taken steps to strengthen its international digital communication \\ninfrastructure by decidi ng to connect to the country’s third submarine cable SEA -ME-WE-6. But more  \\ninitiatives require in order to  meet ing the growing demands of international connectivity.  \\nAlongside, high speed and high capacity robust domestic backhaul throughout the country wi ll be very \\ncritical in upcoming days. At the same time the capacity of transmission equipment will have to be upgraded \\nin a regular basis to meet the growing needs and make them 5G compliant. The more area, people and \\ndevices will have high speed connectiv ity the amount of data will be increased proportionately due to \\nextended participation in digital economy. Adequate investment, monitoring, technology measures and \\ngreater coordination are very important to achieve the goals in this area.  \\n                                                     \\n7  ITU, 2018. Measuring the Information Society Report, 2018.  42.2 100 150100010000\\n0200040006000800010000Mbps  \\n \\n420 \\n e) Utilizing the  potential of Space Technology  \\nBangladesh has launched its first communication satellite ‘Bangabandhu Satellite -1 (BS -1)’ in the orbit to \\nmeet the present demands of the digital communication and broadcasting sector. The Satellite is fitted with \\n26 Ku -Band  and 14 C -Band transponders. The network covers South Asia, portion of south -east Asia and \\nStan-countries. State own Satellite TV Channel BTV along with all the TV channels, DTH services and \\nBangladesh Betar are being broadcasted through BS -1. Stopping the  currency outflow and reaching \\nbroadcast - based services in the remote areas have been made possible due to BS -1. Right now there is a \\nrequirement of a second satellite as the broadcasting sector is already become dependent on the country’s \\nown satellite. Dependency on the satellite services will increase with the planned introduction of 5G and \\nIoT. Furthermore, new satellite - based services such as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), Satellite Phones \\netc.  have to be introduced depending on the market needs.   \\nSatellite ecosystem revolves around the connectivity “beyond” the fibre  and other common means of \\ncommunication. It can support all the sectors of ‘Blue Economy’ i.e. Aquaculture, fisheries, coastal tourism, \\nmaritime transport, research etc. Satellite ba sed ‘Vessel Tracking & Monitoring System (VTMS)’ will \\nfacilitate detect fleet patterns and aids monitoring, control, and surveillance efforts whenever needed, \\nespecially in case of natural disasters. VMS data of Bangladesh’s satellite system also can suppo rt \\ndevelopment of improved stock assessments. Satellites system has the potential to be utmost useful in land \\nmanagement, weather forecasting, water resources management and tracking of oil spills, potential \\npolluters, temperature change and changes in the  bio-system under the deep sea. Furthermore, with the help \\nof e-education and telemedicine through Satellite Systems, the digital divide can be minimized.  \\nf) Digital Security and Privacy  \\nDigital security  and privacy protection have become public policy priori ties due to proliferation of digital \\nand data -dependent economy and society. Digital threats continue to increase and diversify with alarming \\nrapidity. Due to the convergence of the digital and physical environments, technology is now embedded in \\nmost of t he critical infrastructures which are the vital foundation of daily lives.  \\nDigital Crimes, also known as cybercrime, computer crime, electronic crime, hi -tech crime or e -crime \\ninvolves a broad range of potentially illegal activities conducted by the misus e of digital devices and \\ndifferent types of communication networks. Traditional crimes may also be committed through the use of \\ndigital devices and networks. Digital crimes may not have direct contacts with the victims. As less visible \\nand intangible kinds  of property such as information, data and networks are involved in such crimes, victims \\nmay come to know about their losses long after the actual commission of crimes. Miscreants are able to \\nsteal greater amounts with greater comfort and a single act can victimize many people in many places at once.   \\nThe scopes of the digital offences are widespread and are increasing in a very fast pace. Offences against \\nthe confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital data and systems include illegal access (ha cking, \\ncracking), illegal data acquisition (data espionage), illegal interception, exploiting data and system \\ninterference etc. The computer related offences include fraud and computer -related fraud, computer -related \\nforgery, identity theft, misuse of devi ces etc. Examples of content related offences are activities related to \\nerotic or pornographic material, child pornography, religious offences, illegal gambling and online \\ninappropriate games, libel and false information, spam and related threats, other fo rms of illegal content \\n(e.g. how to build explosives, how to produce illegal drugs) etc. The terrorist use of the internet, cyber   \\n \\n421 \\n warfare , Cyber laundering  (i.e. money laundering, use of unauthorized currencies etc.) and phishing are \\ncombination of various  digital offences. Terrorist use of internet includes propaganda, information \\ngathering, preparation of real -world attacks, publication of training material, terrorist communication, \\nterrorist financing, attacks against critical infrastructures etc. Nowada ys online social media spaces have \\nbecome sanctuary for the digital criminals. Digital offences in social media such as criminal activities \\nbroad -sweep scams, trying to lure someone to click on something or visit pages that will push malware on \\nto visitors  computer, searching for careless public exposure of personal data, using social media as a \\nplatform to connect/exchange radical ideas, trade of stolen information, using social media as a platform of \\ndefamation, bullying, spreading hate speech and radical ization etc. are liable for adverse impact on social, \\ncultural, religious and political harmony and integrity. In addition, copyright infringement in the digital \\nspace is a major issue. Emergence of disruptive technologies such as IoT/M2M, Cyber Physical S ystems, \\nArtificial Intelligence etc. imposing new challenges for the judiciary, lawyers, prosecution, \\nenforcement  agencies and compliance professionals. Building trust and solid security protection into digital \\nnetworks and services along with industrial, commercial and consumer products and services has become \\na challenge while comprehensive digital transformation is the goal.  \\nAnother important concern is the personal data privacy principles to an interconnected digital world. This \\nis especially challengi ng when information can be gleaned from a whole range of digital sources such as \\nsocial media, email servers, websites, blogs, online purchases, online inquiries etc. New laws, regulations \\nand codes of practice must be there aiming to balance the interests  of individuals who have a right to \\nprivacy. A key principle of habeas data is the right to own or know and control what information is being \\ngathered and stored by whom and for what purpose. This right empowers the individual to demand \\ncorrections or poss ibly even to delete the information. Personal information usually refers to information \\nthat can be used directly or indirectly to identify a ‘natural’ living person, although in a digital age there is \\nvery little that cannot be used to trace back to a liv ing person. There is a further issue of who has the right \\nof ownership, if anyone, over information of a deceased person. This means that the drafting of new laws \\nor regulations or codes of practice needs to be flexible to changes in technologies and propo rtionate to the \\nlevel of harm that can accrue from inaccurate information or lack of privacy.  \\nIn an interconnected world anything online can be located anywhere on the planet, and with the rise of \\ncloud computing anything online can, in principle, be trans ferred between countries. This is not a by -\\nproduct of the rise of a digital economy, it is the digital economy. Special consideration must be given for \\nusing cloud comput ing to handle information that is vital to national security, to maintaining public t rust \\nand confidence in government, or to manage certain core government functions such as international \\nrelations, property rights protection, maintaining law and order, and national defence .   \\ng) Bridging the Standardization Gap  \\nThe primary goal of the stand ardization of digital devices and communication/operating protocols is to \\nensure that the devices, systems and services can connect and interoperate with each other, doesn’t create \\nhindrance in innovation and above all keeps markets open and competitive. A t the same time \\nstandardization confirms the quality of good and services with a solid degree of predictability, consistency \\nand dependability. Telecommunication and digital device standards act as foundation of the digital single \\nmarket. In the world of d igital technology and services, maintaining standards are very crucial to ensure \\ndigital security as well. In the context of interconnected world, exclusion from accessing, adopting or \\ndeveloping standards can intensify economic inequalities.    \\n \\n422 \\n h) Internet o f Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) Communication  \\nOver the past few years, IoT and M2M has become an integral part of the contemporary digital \\ninfrastructure. IoT enables advanced services by interconnecting people, process and things through the \\ninternet using existing and evolving interoperable digital technologies. IoT makes full us e of \"things\" \\nthrough the utilis ation of identification, data capture, processing and communication capabilities. M2M is \\nforerunner of IoT on which IoT has been improv ed. M2M enables interconnection of machines through \\ndifferent communication technologies such as Electrical wiring, PSTN/ DSL, IEEE 802.3 Ethernets, Wi -Fi \\n(IEEE 802.11 a/g/n/ac/p), Wi -Gig (IEEE 802.11.ad), Z -Wave (ITU -T G.9959), WPANs (Bluetooth (IEEE \\n802.15.1), ZigBeee/6LoWPAN (IEEE 802.15.4), Dash7 (ISO/IEC 18000 -7) etc.), Power line \\nCommunication (PLC), 2G/3G/4G/5G, satellite etc. based on requirements and availability.  \\nThe features associated with the IoT include pervasive identification and addressing,  processing, \\nnetworking and sensing; object to object and object to person communication; massive amount of data \\ncollected and processed from various sources like object identifiers, sensors etc.; automatic communication \\nwithout the consent of the user; he terogeneous objects providing different functionalities depending their \\ncontext of applications. A number of challenges and issues with regard to spectrum allocation plan, service \\nstandards, privacy, data protection and information security are there for t he regulators while the \\nincreasingly complex relationship of IoT/M2M with the networks, service providers and numerous numbers \\nof devices with different needs and diverse applications is a concern.  \\nProper legal bindings, technical standards and guidelines  are yet to be realized in the country regarding IoT. \\nTo enable a 4IR compliant digital connectivity ecosystem, proper guiding documents must be formulated \\nwithin a very short time span.  \\ni) Cloud infrastructure for future computing needs  \\nCloud can be clas sified as Public, Private, Hybrid and Community clouds based on service area. Whereas, \\nservices form cloud may be IaaS (Infrastructure -as-a-Service), PaaS  (Platform -as-a-Service), SaaS  \\n(Software -as-a-Service) or Management, Storage, Database, Process, Secu rity, Application, Testing -as-a-\\nservice. NIST defined five characteristics of cloud computing. Those are o n demand self -service, broad \\nnetwork access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service.  \\nDue to proliferation of cloud infrastructure, t he requirement of allocating substantial fund for self -\\nmaintained data centres  has been diminished. Now entities especially SMEs are able to access powerful \\nresources that they could not afford earlier. Availing desired computing resources on demand throug h the \\nnetwork has become a potential driver for the digital transformation. Avoiding d uplication of resources, \\nreducing  budget, better integration of services, flexibility, energy efficiency, innovation friendliness and \\nrelatively higher data security are few of the benefits of establishing clouds in public and private Digital \\ninfrastructures. With the advent of IoT and M2M and new generation of connectivity (e.g. 5G), the cloud \\ninfrastructure would be a complementary one to support the whole digital ecosys tem and an essential part \\nof 4IR.  \\nk) The ‘Digital Divide’  \\nDigital divide is the gap between individuals and communities that have access to digital technologies and \\nthose that don’t. Digital divide refers to the disparity on the availability, affordabilit y, ability to access and \\nuse digital technologies including internet among demographics, regions, communities and individuals.   \\n \\n423 \\n Digital inclusion, on the other hand, ensures individuals and communities irrespective of their gender, \\nlocation, ethnic identity , religion and socio -economic status have affordability, access to and skills for use \\ndigital technologies so that they can fully participate in and benefit from the knowledge economy.  \\nDigital divide results in social and economic deprivation of the secti on of people who couldn’t get the \\nbenefits offered by digital technologies. In the era of fourth industrial revolution, digital technologies will \\ndetermine how we live, learn and earn. For example, internet connected smart phones with numerous apps \\nmaking peoples’ (who have access to, can afford and use digital technologies) lives easy and more \\nproductive. On the other hand, it will be increasingly difficult for the people without proper access to \\nconnected digital devices and/or sufficient knowledge to use  those devices to participate in the digital \\neconomy. Therefore, technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ will create digital inequalities. Evolving digital \\ntechnologies such as AI, Robotics, IoT, Block chain  will increasingly substitute capital for labour. As a  \\nresult, the beneficiaries of the fourth industrial revolution will be the innovators, disruptors with a certain \\nrange of technical skill sets and globally connected digital platforms as opposed to those who depend on \\ntheir labour. Rising digital inequalit ies, if not addressed comprehensively, will be a major challenge for the \\neconomy and society.  \\nl) Changing demand for Digital Skills  \\nThe fourth Industrial Revolution seems to be very different as the disrupting technological developments \\nare heading to red esign and reengineer the world around us. However, increased digitization, use of robots \\nand Artificial intelligence -based automation has significant impact on the labour market of the coming \\ndays. Undoubtedly, the new wind of change will create new job o pportunities. Although, in parallel billions \\nof jobs will be threatened around the globe. The challenge will be faced both in developed and developing \\nnations. The World Economic Forum (WEF) referred the study of McKinsey Global Institute which claims \\nthat about 800 million people in only 42 countries under study could lose their jobs by 2030.8 By this time \\nmillions of unskilled Bangladeshis are in threat of losing their job at home and abroad due to lack of \\ntechnological skills. WEF identified generic skil ls required to align with the needs of job market beyond \\n2020 which includes complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, \\ncoordinating with others, emotional intelligence, judgment and decision making, service orientation, \\nnegotiation, cognitive flexibility. However digital skills are the specific skillsets which will be required \\nwhile considering the innovative knowledge economy.  \\nAssessment of the manpower requirement of different skills and expertise will be required who wil l build \\nthe foundation of the ongoing digital revolution.  A number of training centers and Institutes will have to \\nbe established throughout the country both under public and private sector initiatives. Alongside, it is \\nneeded to modernize the existing in stitutes with state of art facilities and appropriate pool of resource \\npersons. Industry -academia collaboration will be required to prepare the working forces ready to take \\nchallenges for the new order of the technology horizons. A dedicated organization i s required for research \\nand human Resource Development in digital communications and services and to guide the overall \\nactivities of human resource development.   \\n \\n                                                     \\n8  McKinsey Global Institute, 2017. Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in a Time of Automation.    \\n \\n424 \\n m) Research and Development and indigenous manufacturing of digital devices  \\nAt present Bangla desh Cable Shalpa Limited has the opportunit y to export Optical Fibre  and ducts abroad. \\nIt is encouraging that some of the private sector players already started exporting digital devices like mobile \\nhandsets and IoT devices in the foreign market. The Tele phone Shilpa Sangstha Limited may also extend \\nproduction of all sorts of digital devices and accessories to meet the domestic demands and export. But the \\nmain part will be the manufactures in the private sectors.   \\nTo enhance the competency in indigenous m anufacturing, global software and equipment vendors will have \\nto be encouraged to set up meaningful local presence in Bangladesh in order to support and service their \\nproducts sold into the Bangladesh market and into regional and global markets. In paralle l, a minimum \\namount of value addition  to the  imported  digital  products is required to develop  local capacity  and \\nparticipation. At the same time, synergies amongst manufacturers, R&D centres , academia, service \\nproviders and other stakeholders are essential  for the development of high -quality new products and \\nequipment.  \\n6.6.4  Telecommunication Sector Strategies for 8FYP  \\na) Digital Transformation  \\ni) Formulation of a comprehensive Digital Transformation Strategy (DTS) for Bangladesh by \\n2021.  \\nii) Preparing a phase by  phase implementation roadmap for the Digital Transformation Strategy \\n(DTS) by 2021.  \\niii) Assessing the needs for remodelling  the network including addition and/or removal of \\nnetwork segments to support the National Digital Transformation Strategy.  \\niv) Revising and /or formulating directives, guidelines, regulations, rules and other legal \\nframework in order to support the digital transformation of the industry in minimum time.  \\nb) Fourth  Industrial Revolution (4IR)  \\ni) Making available high -

the proposed ADP allocat ions in \\nconstant and current prices are shown in Tables 6.12 and 6.13 respectively.  In view of the growing dem and \\nfor transport services and the need for modernization of transport infrastructure in preparation for move \\ntowar ds an UMIC, transport investme nt needs will be substantial. The 8FYP financing strategy for transport \\ninfrastr uctures call for greater mobilis ation of PPP investm ents in toll roads, bridges, aviation  and \\ninternational shipping.  Cost recovery policies will be strengthened learning from  the good practice example \\nof the Chittagong Port Authority that earns substantial profits. Cost recovery from airports, inland water \\ntransport, road user charges, and railway services can play a major role in O&M as well as self -financing \\nof investments.   \\nTable 6. 17: 8FYP ADP Allocations for Transport (Taka billion current  prices)  \\nMinistry /Division  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nRoad Transport and Highways Division  177.9 190.0  215.0 233.8 279.1 \\nMinistry of Railways  65.6 75.0 100.0 115.4 140.3 \\nMini stry of Shipping  40.6 50.1 57.7 62.1 74.5 \\nMinistry of Civil Aviation and Tourism  8.3 10.3 11.8 13.8 16.6 \\nPosts and Telecommunications Division  12.1 14.9 17.2 20.0 24.0 \\nBridges Division  55.5 60.0 78.1 88.8 102.5 \\nTotal Transport  360.1 400.3 479.8  533.9 637.0 \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 6. 18: 8FYP ADP Allocations for Transport (Taka billion, FY2021 Constant Prices)  \\nMinistry / Division  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nRoad Transport and Highways Division  177.9  185.0  203.7  217.6  252.8 \\nMinistry of Railways  65.6 73.4 94.1 99.5 115.0  \\nMinistry of Shipping  40.6 47.5 53.1 56.4 61.2 \\nMinistry of Civil Aviation and Tourism  8.3 9.7 11.7 12.9 13.6 \\nPosts and Telecommunications Division  12.1 14.1 16.5 17.2 19.7 \\nBridges Division  55.5 58.1 72.4 80.0 91.3 \\nTotal Transport  360.1  387.8  451.5  483.6  553.6  \\nSource:  Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 7:  \\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT, RURAL  \\nDEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATIVES  \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n433 \\n CHAPTER 7 \\nSTRATEGY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT & RURAL DEVELOPMENT  \\n7.1 INTR ODUCTION  \\nA well -functioning local government system is evident globally, in which the Local Government \\nInstitutions (LGIs) provide a range of services to citizens – education, healthcare, water, sanitation, local -\\nlevel law and order, etc., in consultation  with public participation at local levels. The development process \\nof a nation can only be appropriately in progress when the comprehensive development of rural area is \\nbeing properly addressed. This entails the importance of the Ministry of Local Governm ent, Rural \\nDevelopment and Cooperative ( MoLGRD&C), and provision for LGIs to utilize public resources for local \\ndevelopment which correspond to local needs. The Government of Bangladesh has recognized the roles of \\nLGIs in developments  mandated by the Artic les 11, 59 and 60 in Chapter 3 of the Constitution, which state  \\n“Local government in every administrative unit of the republic shall be entrusted to bodies, composed \\nof persons elected in accordance with law” ( Article 59); and  \\n“Parliament shall, by law, co nfer powers on the local government bodies to impose taxes for local \\npurposes, to prepare their budgets and to maintain funds” (Article 60) .   \\nAt the same time, Section 16 of the Constitution has given high priority for rural development, which \\nstates:  \\n“The State shall adopt effective measures to bring about a radical transformation in the rural areas \\nthrough the promotion of an agricultural revolution, the provision of rural electrification, the development \\nof cottage and other industries, and the improvem ent of education, communications and public health, in \\nthose areas, so as progressively to remove the disparity in the standards of living between the urban and \\nthe rural areas.”  \\nSuch mandates obviously lead to have suitable rural development efforts throu gh the coordination with  \\nwell-structured LGIs that developed over time with the democratically elected representatives. By law, all \\nLGIs are required to have elected representatives, resulting all LGIs are currently administered by elected  \\nrepresentatives,  except the Chittagong  Hill Tracts (CHT), which is under the administration of Chairman, \\nwho is nominated by the central government.  \\n7.2 PROGRESS DURING THE 7FYP  \\nUnder the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the government adopted a comprehensi ve \\npolicy to improve the local government system and to develop the urban and rural areas. In particular, the \\ncoordinated efforts during the 6FYP and 7FYP offered the higher income and employment opportunities, \\nand the country has positioned itself at a le vel of middle -income nation.  In line with the vision, the 7FYP \\nset out two key priorities: (1) Strengthening the Local Government Institutions; and (2) Fostering the Rural \\nDevelopment, involving a reform of the legal/regulatory framework of LGIs, strength ening the local   \\n \\n434 \\n governance; building capacity of LGIs and enhancing both vertical and horizontal coordination with central \\nand local government agencies . \\n7.2.1  Local Government Division  \\nThe LGD undertook various development programmes  and projects, aiming  at enhancing the capacities of \\nLGIs and improving basic services.  The main areas of progress during the 7FYP are noted below  \\nCapacity Building  \\nUnder the leadership of LGD, Bangladesh has made significant progress on strengthening the capacity of \\nLGIs. UP  is now more participatory and proactive; UZPs have been re -instated with the elected \\nrepresentatives; and Pourashavas and CCs have been made stronger. Several interventions that have \\ncontributed to strengthening LGIs include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring transparency and ac countability;  \\n\\uf0b7 Digital transformation of Union Centres;  \\n\\uf0b7 Access to information (a2i);  \\n\\uf0b7 Communication with the people  \\n\\uf0b7 Facilitating training for elected representatives and staffs;  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing technical assistance.  \\nGovernance Improvement  \\nThe Local Government Div ision has undertaken several initiatives to improve the governance and financial \\naccountability of the local government institutions (LGIs). Through PFM reform, the frequency and quality \\nof audits have been improved. Moreover, web -based financial reporting  has been initiated for the UPs. \\nThese PFM reform initiative s will contribute to the LGIs through:  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening annual financial audits and performance assessment systems for UPs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening the preparation of annual financial statements for UPS.  \\n\\uf0b7 Stren gthening the quality of UP audits.   \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing a fully functional MIS system within UPs and LGD  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving service delivery by UPs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Institutionalizing fiscal transfer  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding block grant to selected Pourashavas (on pilot basis)  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing capacity and supporting project implementation  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring accountability and transparency through people’s participation  \\nProjects have also been implemented to improve the governance of urban LGIs through infrastructure \\ninvestment. This performance led infrastructure imp rovement mechanism attributed to the overall \\ngovernance improvement and capacity development not only to selected municipalities and city \\ncorporations, but also created a general consciousness and awareness among all other urban LGIs. Several \\nprogrammes  have been undertaken during the 7FYP  to increase public awareness, women participation in \\nmunicipal development, urban planning, poverty reduction, financial management and transparency, and e -\\ngovernance. Town Level Coordination Committee  (TLCC) has  been for med in many Pourashavas to ensure    \\n \\n435 \\n good governance at local level  Institutional and regulatory framework has been developed for imparting \\nsome essential services like faecal  sludge management (FSM).  \\nInfrastructure d evelopment . In urban area, LGD alone has m ade a significant progress in roads and other \\ninfrastructures during 7FYP, which includes 2 flyovers, 3348 km roads, 1116 footpaths, 1502 km drains, \\n5144 m bridges/culverts, 1042 public toilet, 25 bus/truck terminals, 440 tube -well, 844 km road -\\nmaintenance , 266 dustbins, 7 municipal markets, 30 kitchen markets, 15 park & recreation centres , 4 \\nbathing/boat landing stations, 15 community centre /multipurpose buildings, 21 cyclone shelters, 19,600 \\nstreet lights, 68 rivers/canals dredging and 20 lake/canal emban kments. It has also contributed to develop \\nan Integrated Solid Waste Management system  and 2 Transfer Stations, and supplied 40 garbage dump \\ntrucks (1.5 –3 ton) and 66 vacuum cleaners to Pourashavas. In rural area, LGED has improved 33456 km \\nof rural roads , constructed 152346 m of bridges/culverts, 896 no. of growth centres /rural markets, 243 \\nghats/landing stations, 455 cyclone shelters and 652 numbers of Union Parishad Complexes.  \\nRural Transport:  As of 2019, LGED has developed 89.44% of UPZ roads, 67.41% o f UP roads and \\n20% of village roads.  In particular, 33456 km rural roads and 152346 meters bridges/culverts were built \\nduring the 7FYP . The current status of rural road network in Bangladesh has been shown in the following \\nTable 7. 1. \\nRural Connectivity.  As of 2018, the Rural Access Indicator (RAI) – the proportion of rural people living \\nwithin 2 km of all -season roads of Bangladesh, was estimated at 83.5%.  Except the Upazilas in \\nHaor/wetland/hilly areas, this indicator is more than 90%. Out of 87,223 vill ages, more than 70,000 \\nvillages are well connected.  \\nTable 7. 1:  Rural Roads Infrastructures by Types and Length  \\nRoad types  No. of \\nRoads  Length (Km)  No. of \\nStructures  Length (m)  Gaps  \\nTotal  Paved  Earthen  No. Length (m)  \\nUPZ Rd  4764  37,254  33,323  \\n(89.44 %) 3,931  61,435  425,140  2,340  81,100  \\nUnion Rd  8056  41,828  28,200  \\n(67.41%)  13,628  62,346  327,298  4,360  95,400  \\nVillage Rd - A 48514  1 128,476  36,627  \\n(28.5%)  91,849  87,010  388,196  27,410  245,243  \\nVillage Rd - B 89786  1145,774  18,269  \\n(12.53%)  127,505  53,109  197,156  36,668  220,138  \\nTotal  151120  3353,332  116,419  236,913  263,999  1,337,790  70,778  641,880  \\nSource: Local Government Division  \\nBasic Service Delivery  \\nThe LG D has implemented a large number of projects related to the development  and delivery of water \\nand s anitation  in both rural and urban areas .  In the urban areas , services are provided by city corporations \\nand municipalities. WASA in four city corporation areas made consistent progress with planning, \\ndevelopment and maintenance of water supply, sewerage a nd drainage facilities.   In the rural areas, the \\narsenic presence in a large number of tube wells in the country is still a challenge in access to safe water . \\nThe government has taken a number of interventions, including awareness, arsenic test, providing   \\n \\n436 \\n alternative option for safe drinking water. The number of people exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking \\nwater at 50 ppb reduced from 19.6 to 17.5 million (MICS 2019). However, the access to water on -\\npremises increased from 74.2 per cent to 82.4 per cent from 2012 -13 to 2019 (MICS) .  Open defecation \\nin rural areas has been nearly eliminated. This is a great step towards covering all population under \\nimproved sanitation. However, the proportion of people using the improved sanitation is less, only 64.4%. \\nMore efforts are needed to bring all people under improved sanitation.  \\nPhysical/Master Plan  \\nLGED under the policy of LGD has so far developed 25 4 Pourashava and 2 City Corporation Master Plans. \\nIn addition, 6 more were prepared by the UDD  and other develop ment authorities. The remaining \\nmunicipalities are awaiting the preparation of the Plan, and the gazette notifications from the LGD yet to \\nbe publish ed. However , the enforcement of Master Plans requires creation of position of the Town Planners \\nwith career  development opportunity.  \\nChallenges in LGD  \\nDespite progress, LGIs are facing several challenges to ensure good governance and delivering desired \\nservices to the people. Some of the major challenges include:  \\nUnclear functions and responsibilities of LGIs:  The responsibilities and functions of different LGIs are not \\nalways well defined and sometimes there are overlapping mandates.   \\nRevenue discretion of LGIs and dependency on the central government.  Inadequate revenue remains a major \\nconstraint to LGI perf ormance. Most of the LGIs suffer from the limited own revenues and largely depend \\non funds from the national government that are inadequate and unpredictable. Budgetary constraint is the \\nmost important concern that will need to be addressed to improve LGI service delivery in the 8FYP  \\nShortage of staffing.  The shortage of manpower at UP and UZP seriously constrains rural service delivery. \\nThe UPs lack technical staff to prepare budgets, manage accounts and keep proper records.  ICT staff does  \\nnot exist that prevents the digitization of records.  Increased staffing in UZPs is essential for medium -term \\nplanning and budget, for performing assigned responsibilities, and for record keeping and accountability. \\nOn the other hand, the staffing pattern of municipaliti es needs to be reviewed and  rationalized because some \\nmunicipalities are overstaffed in comparison to actual needs. Such overstaffing increases spending on \\nmunicipal administration, while reducing the allocation for municipal services.  \\nNon-participation a nd weak accountability.  An effective local government system is associated with \\nensuring ‘ citizen’s participation  and accountability’ at local levels. This is critical for achieving the pro -\\npoor development agendas through participatory decision making and  efficient allocation of resources.   \\nInadequate devolution of power for service delivery.  Inadequate devolution of responsibilities to LGI s, \\ninadequate communications and  weak coordination with district/national level administration are  obstacle s \\nin deliv ering services to local people. There is a need for a devolved decision -making power at UP and \\nUZP levels that will improve services delivery by LGIs.     \\n \\n437 \\n Weak resource mobilis ation effort . The absence of fiscal decentralization is a major   impediment to th e \\ngrowth of LGIs as a major service delivery agency at the local level. The only tax source assigned to urban \\nLGIs is the property/holding tax. Yet, yields are insignificant mostly owing to the absence of a well -defined \\nproperty tax system.  There are prob lems with land records (for which LGIs suffer), property valuation \\n(mostly done at historical prices and costs), tax assessments, low tax rates, and weak tax administration.  \\nLGIs do not have the authority to change rates or property valuation. Additionall y, cost recovery for urban \\nand rural services relating to water, sanitation and waste disposal is inadequate. The issue of fiscal \\ndecentralization is discussed in detail in Section 7.3.  \\n7.2.2  Rural Development & Cooperatives Division  \\nRDCD had diverse inte rventions to secure the socio -economic development and accelerating rural economy \\nthrough promotion of rural organizations, micro and supervised credit operation, rural capital management, \\nfacilitating production and market linkage for the rural products, developing rural micro infrastructure, \\nconducting research and action research, etc. The RDCD has made a considerable progress during the \\n7FYP, particularly with increased agricultural and off -farm production, skilled manpower, energy supply, \\nwater and san itation and access to finance for the rural poor (particularly women) and employment \\ngeneration.  \\nProgress in the Past  \\n\\uf0b7 Water resources and irrigation:  During 7FYP,  BRDB managed about 18,000 no of irrigation pump \\nwhich significantly contributed to boost up  the rural agriculture production specially the rice \\nproduction.  The adoption of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) in November 2018 is a major \\nmilestone in the Bangladesh history of integrated management of water resources that is expected to \\nradica lly change the rural economic environment with improved flood control, reduced salinity, \\nreduced water logging, improved drought management and proper irrigation facilities.  This will also \\nimprove coordination of water resource management across the large  number of public agencies \\ninvolved in implementation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Rural employment and livelihood : A total of 23,400 beneficiaries were supported with programmes of \\nrural employment and livelihood involving Tk.166.66 crore  through different projects of the Department  \\nof Cooperatives (DoC) . In addition, around 22,000 households were supported with cross -breed cat tle, \\nwhich have  increased the milk production by 90,000 litres  per day. The Department of Cooperatives, \\nBRDB and other concern agencies under RDCD have  made a progress on the rural employment, \\nlivelihood improvement of disadvantaged women and ethnic people, and breed development. These \\nprogrammes  have contributed to rural e mployment and income generation  ultimately reduced the rural \\npoverty.  BRDB also has tremen dous achievement on micro infrastructure development in rural area in \\ncoordination with UP under the ‘Link Model’ Concept. BARD and RDA contribute to rural development \\nthrough research, action research and training of local government functionaries, civil servants, co-\\noperators  and rural development functionaries of GOs and NGOs.  Bangabandhu Academy for Poverty \\nAlleviation & Rural Development  (BAPARD ) arranges training on various income generating activities \\non farming and off -farming for self -employment of  small and marginal farmers and asset -less \\nunemployed people. During the last five years (From July/2015 to June/2020) it conducted training for \\n15,135 trainees, where 8282 were male and 6853 were female.  During the 7FYP , Palli Daridro \\nBimochon Foundation has implemented several projects aiming at rural employment generation,   \\n \\n438 \\n livelihood development of disadvantaged women and gender equality. A total of 3,00,000 beneficiaries \\nwere supported  with an amount of Tk.350 crore , which created employment opportuniti es for 1,50,000 \\npeople during the 7FYP.  \\n\\uf0b7 Amar Bari Amar Khamar : This special program initiated by the Honourable  Prime Minister to alleviate \\nrural poverty. The objective of this program is to provide financial assistance to selected farming \\nhouseholds to b uild their homestead farm. Currently, some 55 lakh poor households are organized under \\n1 lakh 20 thou sand Village Development Organis ation s (VDO) to support this project.  \\nChallenges of  RDCD \\nRural development policies and projects have contributed signific antly to poverty reduction, employment \\ngeneration and income growth. With improved communications the divide between urban and rural \\neconomies is shrinking.  Yet, there is an unfinished agenda that remains to be addressed to ensure sustained \\nrural developm ent in Bangladesh.  \\nUplifting Rural Economic Growth  \\nThe average productivity gap between urban and rural areas remains at large. This requires further \\nagriculture sector diversification and strengthening of non -farm rural economy.  Furthermore, the povert y \\ndata shows huge variations in rural environment by districts.  Districts with high rural poverty are at a great \\ndisadvantage in terms of infrastructure, vulnerability to natural disasters, adverse effects of climate change \\nand lack of diversified income and employment opportunities. A more balanced approach to rural income \\ngrowth that addresses both the urban -rural divide and the divide among the poorest and richer rural districts \\nis needed.    \\nCoordination of Rural Services and Development Activities  \\nTo attain the perspective plan 2020 -2041, the development efforts in rural area need to be in participatory \\nand coordinated manner. Different government, nongovernment agencies, local government bodies along \\nwith private initiatives has the diverse efforts f or the development of rural area. Alongside this, different \\nagencies provide necessary services also. Yet this services and development efforts and activities are not \\nadequately coordinated. It results in scattered, overlapping, unplanned developments. It is still a huge \\nchallenge to ensure equitably distributed and coordinated rural development intervention both at policy and \\nimplementation level. The PRDP project of BRDB practiced the coordinated service delivery by NBDs and \\nUPs along with the implementat ion of priority -based development planning formulated by the village \\npeople with the active participation of UPs and NBDs. This practice of participatory development should \\nbe promoted nationwide.  \\nReducing Rural Poverty and Inequality:  \\nAccording to HIES 20 16, 26.4% of the rural population were  still living below the poverty line. Moreover, \\nGini coefficient of income distribution in rural areas stands at 0.454. So, the reduction of rural poverty and \\ninequality remains a big challenge.  \\n   \\n \\n439 \\n Reduction of Rural Une mployment:  \\nLabour force survey 2016 -17, BBS shows that among the 63.5 mil lion economically active populations , \\n4.2 per cent were unemployed. As approximately  70% of the total population live s in rural areas, majority \\nof these unemployed people resides in rural areas. So, reduction of rural unemployment is another \\nchallenge.  \\nLack of Digital and GIS based Database and Monitoring System:  \\nAs per mandate outlined in the Allocation of Business of the Government, RDCD is involved in policy \\nmaking, implementing p rojects and programmes addressing various issues of rural development.  A robust \\nand reliable database on various aspects of rural economy is essential for making appropriate policy \\ndecisions and their implementation. At present there is no digital and GIS  based database in the RDCD. \\nThis is an impediment in formulating, implementation  and also evaluating the rural development policies \\nand projects. A reliable GIS based Digital database has to be established to ensure efficient and effective \\nimplementation of the programmes for an inclusive and vibrant rural economy , and also to ensure  the \\nimplementation of the “no one is left behind”  government initiative in sustainable rural development.  \\n7.2.3  Ministry of Chittagong  Hill Tracts Affairs (MoCHTA)  \\nThe 7FYP recognizes  the Chittagong Hill tracts (CHT) as the most disadvantaged and vulnerable region, \\nlacking necessary employment opportunities, healthcare facilities, safe water, sanitation, education and \\ninfrastructure. The government has made considerable effor t to improve the situation as a part of the \\nimplementation of the CHT accord, notably, the implementation of the Tribal Health, Nutrition and \\nPopulation Plan (THNPP), National Education Policy of 2010, the Third Primary Education Development \\nProgram (PEDP 3) and various water, flood control and irrigation projects.   \\nThe MoCHTA has been working to ensure ‘food and nutrition’ security of the people in the hilly region, \\nand implemented several projects to increase households’ income opportunities. These proje cts supported \\nwith the cultivation of varieties of fruits, bamboo and spices, as well as storing, processing and marketing \\nof products.  \\nEducation programmes  continue to facilitate the pre -school education in local languages. To provide \\neducational support  in remote areas, a number of schools, colleges, hostels have been built and educational \\nmaterials were distributed. Moreover, 8500 poor but meritorious students were awarded with scholarships \\nfor higher studies in the last five -year. All contribute to ach ieving the goal of educating the ethnic people \\nin the region.  \\nThe physical and mental health development enhanced through building sports facilities and in the region. \\nMoCHTA has built stadiums and gymnasiums in each of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari , as well \\nas 7 auditoriums and 8 community -centres .  \\nThe ministry continues to facilitate training on ICT to improve the technical capacity of educational \\ninstitutions, journalists, and law -enforcing agencies. It has provided the unemployed youths with adv anced \\ntraining on computer programming, internet, outsourcing and freelancing.    \\n \\n440 \\n Lessons Learnt from the Past  \\nHigh Prevalence of Poverty  \\nCHT is one of the most disadvantaged regions in the country in terms of income, employment, poverty, \\nhealth, nutrition, water, sanitation, education, women employment, and access to infrastructure. The rates \\nof both primary and secondary education remain  far below the national average. As well as food poverty is \\nwidespread, making both ‘absolute’ and ‘extreme’ poverty is muc h higher than the national level; the \\npoverty (head count) rates are 28.5%, 63.2% and 52.7% in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari, \\nrespectively.  \\nStaffing  Shortage  \\nDue to lack of staffing  in the Ministry , CHT Regional Council  and HDCs, remote areas of CHT  is still \\nremaining  underdeveloped. Considering the remoteness of CHT, adequate manpower should be provided \\nin HDCs.  \\nOther Challenges  \\n\\uf0b7 Living in the remote areas makes it hard to reach and mobilize resources to the ethnic people; (ii) \\nLack of specific objec tives in the mainstream policies regarding needs and concerns of the ethnic \\nminorities;  \\n\\uf0b7 Absence of an alphabet and dearth of students, hindering indigenous curriculum development  and \\nconstraining learning ;  \\n\\uf0b7 Low food production and lack of economic opportu nities resulting in food insecurity;  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate institutional mechanism to coordinate with NGOs and the private sector; and  \\n\\uf0b7 The cost of construction is higher due to inadequate road infrastructure and remoteness.  \\nChallenges of MoCHTA  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate roads/tra nsportation resulting difficulties in access to market, building materials and \\nservices.  \\n\\uf0b7 High construction cost in the remote areas of CHT;  \\n\\uf0b7 Making inclusionary National Development Policy for the region;  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing school curriculum in ethnic language;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing the food production in the region;  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of census/statistical data on demography and socio -economic indicators;  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of access to finance  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of access to safe water  \\n\\uf0b7 Political instability linked to low level of law and order  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of opportunity in the non -agricultural sector;  \\n\\uf0b7 Low rate of education and high unemployment rate;  \\n\\uf0b7 Inefficient use and management of land and resources; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Low navigability of rivers.    \\n \\n441 \\n 7.2.4  Investment Program in the 7FYP  \\nRegarding ADP allocation, the government accorded the highest priority to development of the LGIs.  \\nAlthough the allocations fell short of the 7FYP targets, total investments increased considerably over the \\nplan period (Table 7. 2).  On average ADP allocations amounted to 16% of total ADP, which is the hig hest \\nfor any line ministry. Yet, they fell short of meeting the development needs, which suggests the importance \\nof strengthening resource mobilization at the LGI level through fiscal decentralization.  \\nTable 7. 2: FY2017 -FY2021  Development Expenditures ( In Crore Taka)  \\nYear  \\n Local Government  \\n Rural Development & \\nCooperatives  Chittagong Hill Tracts  \\n \\n 7FYP \\nallocations  Annual Dev. \\nExpenditures  Annual \\nGrowth  7FYP \\nallocations  Annual Dev. \\nExpenditures  Annual \\nGrowth  7FYP \\nallocations  Annual Dev. \\nExpenditures  Annual  \\nGrowth  \\n2016/17  16,650  12,374  - 1,020  1,145  - 510 606 - \\n2017/18  20,340  21,526  74.0%  1,450  1,414  23.5%  740 849 40.1%  \\n2018/19  24,210  22,850  6.0%  1,730  1,715  21.3%  880 914 7.7%  \\n2019/20  28,380  25,468  11.5%  2,030  1,695  1.2%  1,030  989 8.2%  \\n2020/21  33,300  29,921*  17.5%  2,380  1,865*  10.0%  1.210  841 15.0%  \\nSource: Ministry of Finance (*Estimated figures)  \\n7.3 FISCAL DECENTRALI SATION  \\nTwo good indicators of fiscal decentralization are the expenditure share of LGIs in total expenditure and \\nthe revenue share of LGIs in total revenues. The higher the contribution of LGI to expenditures and \\nrevenues, the higher is the level of decentralization. The percentage share of LGIs in total government \\nspending shows how much spending authority is devolved to LGIs. The spending auth orities and functions \\nthey represent show  the areas where decentralized service delivery prevails. In a typical decentralized \\nadministration, LGIs tend to have considerable spending authority because they are responsible for delivery \\nof a large number of b asic social and economic services to the community over which they have \\nadministrative jurisdiction including health, nutrition, education, water, sanitation, drainage, waste \\nmanagement, park and recreation services, local transport, local law and order an d local justice. They are \\nheld accountable to the community through the periodic well -defined electoral process based on the \\neffectiveness with which they deliver these services.  Within the community, these are typically one -stop \\nservices with no overlap with another level of government for these specific services.   \\nIn a limited way, share of revenues mobilized is also an important indicator because along with service \\ncharges this allows greater financial autonomy to the LGIs.  However, often for efficien cy reasons most \\nrevenues are collected by a central revenue authority and then shared between the national government and \\nLGIs on a constitutionally determined basis.  By so doing, revenue sharing arrangements are protected from \\npolitical manipulation, esp ecially in the event of representation of LGIs by a different  political party than \\nthe national government. In an environment where a well -defined and constitutionally mandated revenue \\nsharing arrangement does not prevail, the share of revenues collected b y LGIs becomes much more \\nmeaningful and stronger indicator of fiscal decentralization.    \\n \\n442 \\n 7.3.1  Trend in LGI Finances  \\nConsolidated data on LGI finances are not provided in the Budget document or posted on the website. The \\nMinistry of Finance ’s major publicat ion, the Bangladesh Economic Review, also does not provide this \\ninformation. However, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics compiles this information and provides this in \\nthe statistical yearbook. Unfortunately, this data has not been updated since FY2013. H owever, data for \\nFY1974 to FY2013 provides an illuminating picture of what has been happening to LGI finances in \\nBangladesh.  The broad picture on LGI finances remains valid since nothing has changed in terms of fisca l \\ndecentralization. Table 7. 3 summarize s the evolution of LGI finances in Bangladesh. The highlights are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Government transfers have progressively displaced own sources as the most important source of \\nLGI financing. The share of government transfers increased from a low of 26% in FY1974 to a \\npeak of 62% in FY2011. The share of government transfers in total receipts of LGIs however \\ndeclined to 43% in FY2013, primarily because of marked increases in LGI’s own revenues. In the \\ntwo-year period since FY11, LGIs own resource mobilization increased by 1 22% to Tk. 76.2 billion \\nin FY13.  \\n\\uf0b7 Charges and fees are the next important financing source, accounting for 25%.  \\n\\uf0b7 Taxes account for only 14%.  \\n\\uf0b7 There is no market borrowing. The Government budget is responsible for all transfer funding \\nincluding grants and loan s.  Most transfers are in the form of grants.  Large City Corporations get \\nsome limited funding as loans. Since they do not have any capacity for loan servicing, these \\ngovernment loans stay in the books as outstanding dues.  \\nTable 7. 3: Bangladesh LGI Finan ces (Taka millions)  \\nItems  FY1974  FY1978  FY1992  FY2001  FY2011  FY2012  FY2013  \\nTaxes  148 301 2626  4645  12799  13953  18202  \\nCharges & fees  38 165 1750  3774  21541  42599  57986  \\nTotal own resources  186 466 4376  8419  34340  56552  76188  \\nGovernment transfers  66 172 2918 11210  55934  52774  57100  \\nTotal resources  252 638 7294  19629  90274  109326  133288  \\nTotal spending  252 638 7294  19629  90274  109326  133288  \\nSource: BBS Statistical Yearbook, Various Years  \\n7.3.2  LGIs’ Spending Trends  \\nAs noted, LGI spending relative to tota l government spending is a powerful indicator of fiscal \\ndecentralization in Bangladesh. The main findings are as follows.  \\n\\uf0b7 Figure 7.1 shows the share of LGI in total government spending in Bangladesh. Despite some progress \\nstarting from a very low base, LG Is account for only 8.2% of total government spending.  \\n\\uf0b7 In terms of GDP, total LGI spending accounts for a mere 1.11 per cent  (Figure 7.2).  \\n\\uf0b7 In real terms, annual LGI spending increased by approx. 7% over FY1974 and FY2013.  \\n\\uf0b7 The LGRD&C controls and manages mo st urban and rural LGI spending by virtue of its control over \\ngovernment transfers that are the most important source of LGI financing.    \\n \\n443 \\n Figure 7.1: LGI Spending as a Share of Total Government Spending  \\n \\n                Source: BBS St atistical Yearbook, Var ious Years  \\nFigure 7.2: LGI Spending as a Share of GDP  \\n \\n          Source: BBS Statistical Yearbook, Various Years  \\nPoor predictability of Government Transfers  \\nAs noted, LGIs are heavily dependent upon transfers from the national government.  However, what i s \\ndifferent in Bangladesh is that there is no formal legally -mandated resource transfer mechanism. As a result, \\ntransfers are unpredictable and discretionary and there is often little or no correlation between assigned \\nresponsibilities and resource transfe rs. The resource transfers are determined centrally based on political \\nconsiderations and competing national priorities.  \\nMore recently, a major improvement has happened in the allocation of government transfers for the lowest \\nlevel of LGIs – the UPs – based on the agreement with the World Bank in the context of the implementation \\nof the Local Government Support Project II. Transfers to UPs are now made on a formula basis that includes \\npopulation and performance.  \\n3.7\\n3.0\\n5.1\\n 5.0\\n8.2\\n 8.2\\n 8.2\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nFY1974\\n FY1978\\n FY1992\\n FY2001\\n FY2011\\n FY2012\\n FY2013\\n0.36\\n0.54\\n0.80\\n0.67\\n0.99\\n1.04\\n1.11\\n0.00\\n0.20\\n0.40\\n0.60\\n0.80\\n1.00\\n1.20\\nFY1974\\n FY1978\\n FY1992\\n FY2001\\n FY2011\\n FY2012\\n FY2013  \\n \\n444 \\n 7.3.3  Weak Own Revenue Sources  \\nThe level of  fiscal decentralization as measured by resource mobilization is even weaker. LGIs account for \\nless than 4% of total government revenues (Figure 7.3).  Own revenue effort of LGIs including taxes and \\ncost recovery from services fell from 5.1% of total reven ues in FY1974 to 2.54% in FY2011 before \\nrecovering slightly to 3.82% in FY2013.  This is mainly by design as almost all potent sources of revenues \\nare controlled at the national level. The only tax source assigned to urban LGIs is the property/holding tax.  \\nYet, yields are insignificant mostly owing to lack of political will to design and enforce a well -defined \\nproperty tax.  There are problems with land records, property valuation (mostly done at historical prices \\nand costs), tax assessments, very low tax r ates, and very weak tax administration. LGIs do not have the \\nauthority to change rates or property valuation.   \\nFigure 7.3: LGI Own Revenues as a Share of Total Government Revenues  \\n \\nSource: BBS Statistical Yearbook, Various Years  \\nA breakdown of own resour ces between taxes and cost recovery shows that cost recovery component has \\nperformed better than tax revenues (Figure 7.4). Thus, the share of taxes in total LGI revenues has fallen \\nfrom a high of 75% in FY1974 to 45% in FY2013. Nationwide, tax collection is a major fiscal challenge, \\nbut is has been an even bigger problem for LGIs. As a share of GDP, LGI tax collection declined from 0.3% \\nof GDP in FY1974 to only 0.16% in FY2013. The improved performance of cost recovery is an encouraging \\nsign.  Indeed, it g athered some steam after FY2011 as a response by LGIs to the falling share of transfers. \\nThis effort helped LGIs to protect some of their spending programmes .  Otherwise, LGI spending could \\nhave collapsed to less than 1% of GDP.  Cost recoveries have great er potential for urban LGIs (Pourashavas \\nand CCs) since these institutions provide a range of services to citizens and can pass on the costs through \\nadjustments in user charges. Rural LGI, particularly for the UPs the opportunities are limited —nontax \\nincom es being limited to issuance of birth certificates, residency and character certificates, and license fees \\nfor shops and establishments.  5.11\\n4.244.60\\n3.48\\n2.543.343.82\\n0.001.002.003.004.005.006.00\\nFY1974 FY1978 FY1992 FY2001 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013Percent  \\n \\n445 \\n Figure 7.4: Revenue Shares of Taxes and Cost Recovery in LGI Own Revenues  \\n             \\n               Source: BBS Stat istical Yearbook, Various Years  \\n7.3.4  Spending Disparity by LGI Entities  \\nWhile all LGI entities face tremendous financing challenges, some are relatively better off than others. City \\nCorporations in general have better financing options that allow  them to have better command over \\nresources than other LGI entities (Figure 7.5). Since the number of City Corporations is only 12, per unit \\nthey command substantially higher resources than other LGIs. UPs collectively account for 27% of total \\nLGI spending, but whe n this is adjusted for the number of UPs (4554), per unit spending by UPs is very \\nlow.  Thus, in FY2013 the average UP level spending amounted to a mere Taka 7.9 million in FY2013, \\nwhich is equivalent to $100,000 a year. The UPs are the primary government contacts with the rural \\npopulation.  With such meagre  resources to provide services to an average population size of 23000 people \\nper UP, it is hardly surprising that the development impact of UPs is negligible.  \\nThe financial circumstances of the municipa lities that provide essential services such as water supply, \\nsanitation, waste management and drainage to the urban population outside the jurisdiction of the 12 City \\nCorporations  are similarly dire.  On average in FY2013 each municipality spent about Taka  113 million, \\nwhich is equivalent to $1.4 million, to provide these critical services to an average population of 124 \\nthousand people per municipality.  It is mind boggling to imagine what kind of basic urban services can be \\nprovided from a spending level of $11 per person per year. The situation is better for CCs, especially in \\nDhaka, but urban LGIs are heavily financially constrained to provide meaningful services to their \\nconstituencies.  \\n \\n \\n0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.0\\nFY1974 FY1978 FY1992 FY2001 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013PercentLGI taxes as share of own revenues LGI cost recovery as share of own revenues  \\n \\n446 \\n Figure 7.5: Spending Shares of LGI Entities  \\n       \\n  Source: BBS  Statistical Yearbook, Various Years  \\n7.3.5  Fiscal Decentrali sation: International Comparison  \\nA review of international evidence suggests that Bangladesh is fiscally amongst the most centralized \\ncountries in the world measured in terms of both expenditures  and taxes (Table 7. 4).  Data from a sample \\nof 16 developing countries and 26 developed countries shows that spending by LGIs account for 19% of \\ntotal government spending in developing countries and 28% for industrial countries as compared with only \\n7% in Bangladesh. Taxes similarly are heavily centralized in Bangladesh. Thus, sub -national government \\ntaxes account for 11.4% of total taxes in a sample of 16 developing countries and 22.7% in a sample of 24 \\nindustrial countries.  In Bangladesh, it is only 1.6%  of total government taxes.  \\nTable 7. 4: Fiscal Decentralization in Comparison with Other Nations for the 2000s  \\nContext  Sub-national government expenditures  Sub-national government taxes  \\n% of total government \\nexpenditure  % of \\nGDP  % of total taxes  % of GDP  \\nDeveloping countries  18.8 \\n(n=16)  5.1 \\n(n=20)  11.4 \\n(n=16)  2.3 \\n(n=20)  \\nIndustrial countries  27.8 \\n(n=26)  13.9 \\n(n=26)  22.7 \\n(n=24)  6.4 \\n(n=25)  \\nBangladesh  7.0 1.11 1.6 0.15 \\nSource: Bhal, Linn and Wetzel 2013.

Lack of fiscal autonomy and asso ciated resource \\nconstraint reduces the ability of LGIs to provide adequate services in several ways:  \\n\\uf0b7 Weak fiscal decentralisation contributes to grossly inadequate resources that in turn lead to poor \\ncapacities of LGIs to deliver services;  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequacy of st affing in both quantity and quality is a major bottleneck to service delivery;  \\n\\uf0b7 Centralised decision -making on spending results in poor accountability of LGIs, especially City \\nCorporations and municipalities;  \\n\\uf0b7 Since transfers have no legal basis and are disc retionary, there is no predictability of resources.  \\nGovernment control over revenues and spending essentially means that elected managers belonging \\nto the opposition political parties have little control over service delivery  that depends on \\ndiscretionary  fiscal transfer s from the national  government;  \\n\\uf0b7 The scope for innovative financial solutions at the local level is limited by the weakness of the \\nproperty tax design , the absence of public borrowing by LGIs  and by inadequacy of effective public \\nprivate par tnership . \\n7.4 OBJECTIVES, TARGETS AND STRATEGIES FOR LGRD&C IN THE 8FYP  \\nConsistent with PP2041, the main goal of the LGRD&C sector is to achieve “ effective, accountable and \\nequitable local government system, and rural development in Bangladesh” . All programme s and projects \\nwill be in line with this fundamental goal. This is essential to take Bangladesh to the path of an UMIC by \\nFY2031. A performance -based evaluation system has been introduced by the LGD to enhance the capacity, \\naccountability, transparency & h ealthy competitions among LGIs , in particular , for U Ps, City Corporations \\nand Municipalities that are included in foreign aided projects. For all other urban LGI s that do not get \\nforeign financing , similar harmonic standardize system will be adopted.  The s ystem will continue until the \\nperformance reaches at a level of standard, which will be used as a measure of additional allocation of ADP \\nand other dividends within the sector. An effective, accountable and equitable Local Government  System \\n(LGS) can ensur e an efficient allocation and use of limited resources, participation at local level and good \\ngovernance. Such a system can contribute to achieving the broad objectives of:  \\n(1) Improved governance at local levels;  \\n(2) Resource mobilization and coordinati on between the national and local government; and  \\n(3) Delivery of necessary services to the urban and rural people .   \\n \\n448 \\n Rural development is particularly associated with the aim of transforming the country into Middle -Income \\none. The roles of the RDCD are very  relevant and critical to this context. The contribution of RDCD to this \\ntransformation is largely contingent upon the available resources and capacity of the sector to facilitate \\nnecessary training for skill development of the rural population, employment /self-employment \\nopportunities and development of rural infrastructure. The broad goal of RDCD is to ensure adequate \\nemployment and income generation for the rural population . In light with the government’s priority program \\n“My Village -My Town ”, a philosop hical change in planning, promoting and implementing rural \\ndevelopment program and projects to be visioned during 8FYP . \\n7.4.1  Local Government Division (LGD)  \\nThree broad objectives of the LGD are to achieve good governance at local levels; improve LGI res ource \\nmobilization; improve service delivery; and strengthen coordination between national government and \\nLGIs. These are elaborated in detail below:  \\nMain objectives for LGD for the 8FYP  \\n(1) Ensure good governance at local levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Define functions of LGIs and RDIs at all levels and clarify roles and responsibilities between \\nsectoral ministries / agencies and LGIs for service delivery to the people  \\n\\uf0b7 Update guidelines for linking local development plan with the national development plan  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen capacity of  LGIs, RDIs and associated agencies   \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure local level participation in planning and monitoring the functions of LGIs  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote the performance - based incentive system for the LGIs  \\n\\uf0b7 Conduct action research on local development and disseminate results   \\n\\uf0b7 Prom ote women’s empowerment in the LGIs and RDIs  \\n (2) Improved service delivery  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide sustainable physical and social infrastructures and improve rural infrastructure  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure appropriate services at grass root level in line with the principle of “leaving no one \\nbehind”   \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure safe water supply and sanitation facilities in a sustainable manner  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve e -governance system and services  \\n\\uf0b7 Extend social safety nets coverage  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote primary health care  and nutrition  services  \\n(3) Enhanced resource mobilization an d coordination between national and LGIs  \\n\\uf0b7 Reform national transfers to LGIs by making them criteria base, transparent and predictable  \\n\\uf0b7 Sharply strengthen LGI resource mobilization focused on property taxes and cost recovery of \\nservices  \\n \\n   \\n \\n449 \\n Key Strategies for I mproved LGI Governance during the 8FYP  \\nImproving governance within the Local Government Institutions (LGI) is central for both delivering public \\nservices efficiently to the local communities and also ensuring that local concerns are internalized when \\ndecis ions related to policy and the allocation of resources for LGI are taken by the Government. Moreover, \\nto strengthen governance, reforms are needed to improve the: {i} administrative functions of LGIs; {ii} \\nservice delivery functions of LGIs; and {iii} Publ ic Finance Management (PFM) functions of LGIs. Against \\nthis context, the Government will prioritize the implementation of three strategic documents under the FYP, \\nwhich are:  \\nStrategy for Governance Improvement of City Corporations (SGICC) (2020 – 2030) : This strategic \\ndocument aims to improve governance in the administration of City Corporations between 2020 and 2030,  \\nand it has four key goals – {i} formulating and implementing the legal instruments that are requited for the \\nimplementation of the City Corp oration Act 2009; {ii}Introducing systems of continuous organizational \\nimprovement and development in the City Corporations; {iii} Strengthening the fiscal foundations of the \\nCity Corporations and preparing their budgets based on multi -year fiscal framewor ks; and {iv} Systems for \\ncontinuous development of the human resources in the City Corporations will be established by the \\nGovernment. Furthermore, each of these goals will be addressed through multiple strategic directions, \\nwhich will be executed to ensur e that the specified targets are attained and administrative governance within \\nthe City Corporations is improved under the 8FYP . \\nNational Strategy for Paurashava Governance Improvement (2016 -2025) : The objective of this strategic \\ndocument is to ensure that  the Paurashavas (Municipalities) become eligible to provide priority public \\nservices to their citizens at satisfactory levels in a sustainable manner by the year 2025. In particular, four \\nkey specific goals are prioritized, which are: (i) increasing the r evenues of the Paurashavas; (ii) proper \\nestablishment of the Paurashavas’ financial management with the implementation of an appropriate \\nPaurashava Development Plan; (iii) Carrying out the administrative activities of the Paurashavas efficiently \\nand effect ively in accordance with the laws, rules, regulations and other legal instruments; and (iv) \\nstrengthening the human resources of Paurashavas. Hence, under the 8FYP , the Government will prioritize \\nthe implementation of all the identified activities for each  of the respective goals that are underscored in \\nthe strategic document.    \\nMid and Long -Term Strategy for Upazila Parishad Governance Improvement:  This strategy document \\naims to clarify the basic policy directions to achieve efficient and accountable Upaz ila Parishads (UP). It \\nfirst defines the mission statement of Upazila Parishads, which indicates that the public services to be \\ndelivered at the Upazila levels are improved through a planned and integrated process of all development \\nactivities at the Upazi la levels by 2041. It highlights “coordination” as the core function of Upazila \\nParishads. When the coordination by the Upazila Parishad functions effectively, the delivery of public \\nservices at the Upazila level is expected to be improved. In particular, seven key targets were pointed out \\nthat will be prioritized under the  8FYP, which are: (i) ensuring of both horizontal and vertical coordination \\nby the Upazila Parishads; (ii) proper function of Upazila Committees and contribution to better coordination \\nwith the transferred line departments; (iii) preparation of both Five -Year Plans (FYP) and Annual \\nDevelopment Plans (ADP) by the Upazila Parishads; (iv) proper reflection of the citizens’ views in the \\nUpazila Parishads’ budgets as well as their development plans (both Five -Year Plans and Annual \\nDevelopment Plans); (v) proper preparation of the budgets and other annual financial statements in \\naccordance with the relevant laws and guidelines; (vi) proper monitoring of the Upazila Parishads’ activities   \\n \\n450 \\n by the c oncerned Wing of the Local Government Division (LGD); and (vii) Establishment and \\nimplementation of a training mechanism that covers all the Upazila Parishads.  \\nLesson of Previous Successful Experiences:  The Government could draw lessons from global experi ences \\nand /or from successful past and existing projects. One such positive experience is the local governance \\nprogramme “Sharique”, which equipped Union Parishads with capacities and competencies that aimed at  \\nhelping them to serve the citizens with bette r local services in a more accountable, socially inclusive and \\neffective manner besides contributing to the empowerment of local citizens to make inclusive, gender \\nsensitive and pro -poor collective choices (Box 7.1)  \\nBox 7.1: Step -by-Step Guide to Inclusiv e, Effective and Accountable Local Governance in Bangladesh  \\nThe Sharique project started in 2006 which was supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation \\n(SDC) and implemented by HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation.  Sharique started with the aim  to equip Union \\nParishads with capacities and competencies that aimed to help them to serve the citizens with better local services \\nin a more accountable, socially inclusive and effective manner besides contributing to the empowerment of local \\ncitizens to make inclusive, gender sensitive and pro -poor collective choices. In order to establish an effective local \\ngovernance regime, joint and participatory decision making from the citizens, awareness of their rights and being \\nable to demand it to the concerned officials need to be practiced. The programme aims to target all these areas by \\nproviding training on matters like budgeting and planning, roles and responsibilities of UP representatives and \\nStanding Committees, gender equality issues, women leadership tr aining, etc. The programme enabled formation \\nof citizen groups (ward shavas) who are allowed to oversee the UP activities and also provide advocacy services to \\nthe UP. Sharique’s main focus is on inclusive rural development with participation of poor and d isadvantaged, and \\nwith emphasis on women rights in particular.  \\nIn order to promote ‘good governance’ practices, the programme’s agenda include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Inclusion, equality and non -discrimination : No group will be excluded from facilities and proactive \\npublic inte gration policies will be implemented for the impoverished, religious minorities, disadvantaged \\ngroups, women, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Effectiveness and efficiency : Proper distribution of entitlements and rigorous public procurement \\npractices are part of the agenda.  \\n\\uf0b7 Accounta bility:  People should have right to information, be able to give recommendation/feedback on \\nservices they receive and bring forth changes, if necessary. The controlling agencies will reward those \\nwho perform well and punish those who abuse power.  \\n\\uf0b7 Particip ation:  All groups including minorities will contribute to decision -making process and express \\nview -points whenever necessary.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transparency : Public should obtain information from the LGIs about decisions they take and changes \\nthey plan on implementing. Inf ormation should be readily available to all.  \\n\\uf0b7 The rule of law : Some of the key elements include non -discrimination and equality, independence and \\nimpartiality of the judiciary and respect for human rights.  \\nSteps towards inclusive and accountable local gove rnance have been planned in five major steps and two transversal \\nelements: (i) Awareness raising and assessing governance; (ii) Strengthening coordination structures; (iii) Opening \\nup participatory spaces; (iv) Integrated planning; (v) Budgeting and financ e management; and (vi) Gender equality \\nand pro -poor governance. Most of t hese objectives focus on analys ing a particular situation faced by the locals, \\nempowering disadvantaged groups, mandating planning and budgeting tasks among other things. Revealing \\ninformation to the citizens and owning up for any misuse of power by the concerned officials are the main elements \\nof enforcing effect ive local governance practices.  \\nOne of the main successes of Sharique project is building ‘trust’ by convincing both LGIs an d the citizens that the \\nspirit of the project is in their favour . Sharique’s learning is that often citizens do not get information because they \\ndo not know how to ask for it because of limited communication skills and because UPs are often unreachable. \\nSharique has facilitated the creation of ward platforms (i.e. active citizens groups) which enabled information to \\npass from one concerned part y to the other with much ease.    \\n \\n451 \\n Government department workers are now more available and services of NGOs more harm onised with UPs and \\nline departments’ activities. UPs now have better access to the services provided by private traders (especially agri -\\ntraders) and are therefore more competent in eliminating manipulation of prices and adulteration of goods. Short \\ncheck lists, which were developed by Sharique for conducting Union Development Coordination Committee \\n(UDCC) meetings help UDCC members be more structured, committed and result oriented. Bi -monthly meetings \\nhave improved communication, however, follow up actions  from these meetings need to be taken on by the UPs. \\nUDCC has proved so far to be the best platform where any issues can be discussed  whether those are of direc t UP \\nresponsibility or beyond.  \\nSharique trained UPs to provide information about any upcoming e vents in advance. Informing the citizens \\nbeforehand about meetings enabled better and diversified participation and helped them to bring about discussions \\non concerning issues and suggestions. Another element that helped achieve a more meaningful participa tion was \\ntraining women in ‘speak up’ skills for which the number of women in ward shava and budget meetings often \\noutnumber men in recent times. UP bodies now feel more confident on how to fulfil  the government requirements \\nregarding the elaboration of a Five-Year Plan. Previously they had no material available on how to develop it until \\nSharique trained them on what should be done, step by step and according to the law. Sharique promoted better \\naccountability measures by making budget calendars and budget  forecasts for which the PFM training proved to be \\na major breakthrough. Projects conforming to gender -stereotypical roles have been successful to encourage greater \\nparticipation of women, it may be anticipated that their demands for projects and roles wil l evolve accordingly. A \\nnumber of lessons can be taken from the Sharique project, such as - accountability can be better promoted through \\ncollective feedback synthesized by facilitators in a constructive manner, both citizens and UP members must be \\naware of  all activities and tools used a nd last but not least, it is important to overcome the stereotype that UPs are \\nreluctant to cooperate and provide information.  \\n \\nIntroducing the National Integrity Strategy (NIS) at the Upazila Level for Improving Governance  at \\nLocal Government Institutions (LGIs)  \\n The Government of Bangladesh has formulated a National Integrity Strategy (NIS) in 2012 for the \\npromotion of good governance in the State as well as in the society. The Government has been actively \\npromoting the NI S as a part of strengthening transparency and accountability of both State and non -state \\norganizations. Therefore, the Cabinet Division has taken activities for strengthening the mechanisms of \\naccountability, including the Citizen’s Charter, Grievance Redr essal  System (GRS), Annual Performance \\nAgreement (APA), Public Hearing, One Stop Service Centres, Small Improvement Program, Right to \\nInformation (RTI), e -Governance and e -service delivery. During the 7FYP , the Cabinet Division has been \\npromoting the NIS m ainly to the Ministries/Division and State Institutions mentioned in the Strategy, by \\nforming Ethic Committees, assigning Integrity Focal Points, formulating and implementing NIS work -plans \\nled by quarterly monitoring and annual evaluations. However, this division has also started expanding the \\nNIS to the local levels by issuing the guidelines for departments/attached bodies and regional/field level \\noffices to formulate and implement the NIS work -plans.  \\nIn light of enhancing more effective and citizen -first delivery of services, the Cabinet Division during 8FYP \\nwill promote localization of the NIS, with central roles of the Local Government Institutions (LGIs). With \\nimplementation of the NIS Support Project Phase II, the Cabinet Division prioritizes NIS loc alization of \\nNIS to the Upazila Parishads and City Corporations. Upazila Ethic Committees, headed by the Upazila \\nNirbahi Officers (UNO) and with Chairperson, Upazila Parishad as advisor, will develop, implement and \\nmonitor the progress of NIS work -plan. Th e implementation of the above -mentioned NIS -related policies \\nis promoted with active involvement of NIS promoters, such as educational institutions, local media and \\nthe Upazila Corruption Prevention Committees. Besides, there are plans to strengthen the pr omotion and \\npractice of the NIS in other state and non -state institutions.        \\n \\n452 \\n Improving Public Financial Management (PFM) for Local Government Institutions (LGIs)  \\nSound financial management is a key for all tiers of LGIs, regardless of urban or rural, to  deliver public \\nservices effectively.  Building on the notable progress made during the 7 FYP, challenges still remain in the \\nfollowing aspects, which will be given special  attention and efforts by both the central government, mainly \\nLocal Government Divis ion, and LGIs made during the 8FYP. In particular, the focus will be on:  \\nLegal Instruments : The Local Government Acts, developed for each tier of the LGIs, provide overall \\nframework for their financial management, some of which are insufficient and/or outd ated for addressing \\nthe increasing needs of their citizens. Thus, these laws will be routinely evaluated and updated.   \\nPlanning and Budgeting:  As per the provisions of the Local Government Acts, each tier of the LGIs is \\nmandated to prepare annual and/or m ulti-year development plans, to which the allocation of budgets should \\nbe well linked. Predictability of the amount and timing of the transfer of Annual Development Programme \\n(ADP) grants will be improved, considering the due process of preparing annual bu dgets.  In light of \\nensuring the right to information as well as its disclosure, the preparation, execution and reporting of Annual \\nDevelopment Plans/Budgets will be undertaken through a more transparent and accountable process for the \\nrespective citizens.  For the Upazila Parishads, adequate coordination with Transferred Line Departments \\nwill be prioritized as it is essential for preparing comprehensive development plans.  \\nIncreasing the Resource Mobilization Capacity of LGIs : Administrative capacity for th e collection of \\ntaxes will be improved, especially for holding tax, which is the major source of own revenue for the LGIs. \\nPeriodic reassessment of the holding tax, improving the coverage of collection, development of standard \\ntraining materials, creating awareness amongst citizens including the introduction of incentives as well as \\npenalties are particularly important for the urban LGIs (City Corporations and Paurashavas). A \\ndecentralized administrative system is not effective without fiscal responsibiliti es as well. There is a large \\npotential to increase domestic resource mobilization through fiscal decentralization which would involve \\nmore revenue -raising and expenditure authority divested to the LGIs. The existing resource transfer \\nmechanism from the bud get through the ministries to the local government will be reviewed along with the \\nblock resource transfer formula to local government, including the municipalities and city corporations \\ntaking into account, equity and efficiency considerations. The revers e flow —of revenue proceeds from the \\nmunicipal/city corporation, upazila and union levels to higher levels of the LGI and government system \\nalso needs serious review.  \\nDeveloping an Effective Revenue Sharing Mechanisms:  A new formula for revenue sharing mech anism \\nwill be devised, which incentivizes the LGIs to increase revenue mobilization and make them more vibrant \\nat the local level in serving local residents.  The recommended measures also require strengthening the \\ncapacity of LGIs in PFM in particular. Th ey also require rationalizing and selective filling of the large \\nnumber of existing vacancies and selective increases in staff strength to address the mismatch between the \\nneeded skills and existing skills among staff. Of critical importance also, is the t raining and up gradation  of \\nfiscal and financial management capacity, starting with basic book -keeping, financial reporting, and audit \\nmanagement practices of existing LGI staff. Finally, upgrading the LGI systems to operate in a stronger \\ndecentralized sys tem will be accompanied by measure to ensure responsiveness, public participation, \\npartnership with NGOs and community -based organizations, while maintaining high standards of \\ntransparency and accountability.    \\n \\n453 \\n Increasing Inter -Governmental Fiscal Transfers : Although the total amount of ADP allocation for the \\nLGIs has been showing a steady increase, the percentage of ADP for LGIs against total ADP has been \\nactually decreasing, around 5% in FY 2016/17 to 2% in FY 2019/20.  To sustain the economic growth \\ngaine d during the 7FYP , more allocation of ADP for the LGIs will be directed to implement public \\ninvestment projects - so that they can directly manage their own planning and budgeting systems. At the \\nsame time, the Government will put in place a fiscal formula , which will partially determine the amount of \\nADP an Upazila receives as basic ADP on the basis of its socio -economic needs by taking into consideration \\nkey socio -economic factors such as population, area, remoteness and poverty rate, etc. On the other ha nd, \\na share of the ADP will be shaped by the fiscal and developmental performance of an Upazila \\nAdministration and will be institutionalized as  Performance Based ADP. This will also ensure predictability \\nand timely release of budgetary transfers.  \\nImprovin g PFM Staffing Resources:  In order to get any feasible improvements in PFM practices, some \\nminimum increases in resource inflows and PFM -related capacity building is essential.  As a minimum, \\neach UP (rural LGI) must have at least one budget officer who is  trained in IT and have a basic computer \\nfacility. Hence, GoB will ensure that each UZP and municipality will have one budget officer, one trained \\nfinancial management specialist, one trained IT staff, and computer facilities.  \\nStrengthening Supervision an d Monitoring Capacity of LGD:  In the absence of a formal mechanism of \\nsupervision, monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of PFM rules and regulations, expected progress will \\nnot be possible.  As such, monitoring and supervision capacities of LGD will be s ubstantially strengthened.   \\nImproving the u nderstanding about Budget:  LGI officials will be trained and mandated to use the budge t \\ndocument to  achie ve development  objectives. This will entail monitoring of budget execution \\nprocess/operation on a quarterly  basis at the beginning and eventually on a monthly basis for the LGI \\nofficials to undertake corrective measures during the fiscal year.  \\nMandate Multi -Year Budgets:  A multi -year budget approach, as opposed to an annual budget, will be \\nformulated under the  8th Plan period in order to more efficiently assess future revenues and expenditures \\nand the stability or instability related to these budget items. This type of budgeting mechanism will help \\ndeter unsustainable expenditure increases.  \\nExpanding LGI’s Taxa tion Authority:  The Government will facilitate an expansion of taxing power that \\nallows local governments to decide how and how much to tax in order to best match their community’s \\ndemographics, budget and political realities. The top priority is to streng then the system of property taxation \\nthrough proper and computerized land record, proper land and property valuation and sensible tax rates that \\nallow some minimum revenue mobilization.  \\nStrengthen and Simplify Revenue Collection Efforts:  The Government wi ll ensure improvements in tax \\nadministration including proper assessments, avoiding harassment of citizens, effective consultation with \\ntaxpayers and community leaders to develop business partnership, and property accounting and record \\nkeeping o f revenues.   \\nIntroduce IBAS ++ Accounting at LGI level :  With the adoption of IBAS++ at the national level budgeting \\nand accounting system, a horizon has opened up for proper accounting at LGI levels. The Government will \\nconsider the extension and adoption of IBAS++ in the LGIs  during the 8 FYP.    \\n \\n454 \\n Strengthening of LGI Audits : Audit of LGI operations will be strengthened in meaningful and practical \\nways .  Specific suggestions include physical verification and updating the  Asset Stock Register on an \\nannual cycle; making th e standing committee on audit and accounts functional and accountable; ensuring \\nthe LGIs take necessary steps to implement prior audit observations; recruit better -quality private audit firm \\nto do sound audits, which will contribute the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance mobilization of local revenue and resources   \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure adequate and equitable allocation of funds  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure better coordination in planning, implementation and monitoring of development \\nprogrammes    \\n\\uf0b7 Improve both horizontal and vertical coordination and linkage s among LGIs  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure appropriate policy for adequate resource mobilization and allocation.  \\nRural Transport Development & Management  \\n(1) Rural r oad development strategy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of climate, disaster and other impact resilient rural transportation networ k that will \\nbe able to accommodate a vibrant middle - income economy and gradually lead to a developed \\nnation economy;  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of roads with more economic and social priority that will be able to generate more \\nemployment, other economic -social benefits simultaneously will add more growth to rural \\neconomy. Development of prioritized roads at the first phase will accelerate more growth and \\neventually will generate money for less priority roads;  \\n\\uf0b7 Multimodal transport development for Haor, Wetland and Hilly r egions so that the people of these \\nareas can merge with the present pace of development of the country restoring the ecosystem; and   \\n\\uf0b7 Rural road master plan will be followed and preservation of agricultural land will be considered \\nduring new road developme nt and up -gradation.  \\n(2) Rural Road Operation and Maintenance Strategy  \\n\\uf0b7 Active involvement of UPZs, UPs and local communities will be considered for operation and \\nmaintenance of the rural roads. A framework will be developed for their scope of involvement ; \\n\\uf0b7 Technology driven road asset information system will be developed to assess the maintenance \\nneed with more accuracy and respond quickly;  \\n\\uf0b7 An efficient system for patch repairing and potholes management will be developed so that the \\nroads can be restored immediately without further deterioration;  \\n\\uf0b7 For rehabilitation of rural roads after major disasters, ‘Build Back Better method’ of ‘Sandai \\nFramework of Disaster Risk Prevention’ will be followed;  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintenance of existing rural roads will be given priority ov er new road development and justified \\nfund will be allocated according to demand for maintenance; and  \\n\\uf0b7 A comprehensive asset management policy, strategy will be developed and required capability \\naccording to policy, strategy will be developed for a holisti c management of rural road asset.  \\n   \\n \\n455 \\n  (3) Strategic priorities for rural road network  \\n\\uf0b7 LGED will upgrade and maintain the rural road network in the master plan.  The road network will \\nbe developed in a way to withstand floods and disasters, which will connec t the growth \\ncentre /markets, villages and Upazila roads.  The Upazila road network will connect with the \\neconomic zones, special economic zones, export processing zones, industries, land ports, river \\nports, sea ports and railway stations. It will also incl ude construction/reconstruction of \\nbridges/culverts on these roads. Connectivity with railway and waterways will be given priority to \\nintegrate multimodal transport system with rural road network. Existing paved road network will \\nalso be included. Based on  the economic and social importance, the core roads will be selected;  \\n\\uf0b7 The second priority will be to improve Upazila Roads, Union Roads and Village Roads including \\nculverts/bridges which have strategic importance to connect road  network, disconnected vill ages \\nand major population of a village, railway, waterway and major farmlands. The selection of these \\nroads will be based on economic and social priority; and  \\n\\uf0b7 The third priority will be the inter villages and intra -villages roads connectivity.  \\nRural Growt h Centre /Markets  \\nRural growth centres /markets work as a catalyst for supply -chain system, and add value to local products. \\nMy Village -My Town  envisions a vibrant rural economy with available jobs, high growth and standard rural \\nlivelihood. The following st rategies will be undertaken during 8FYP for rural transformation:  \\n\\uf0b7 More Growth centre /markets (GCs) will be developed near the economic zones to create synergy \\nin development and thus more employment opportunities;  \\n\\uf0b7 Special GCs will be developed at some are as to promote special localized products such as \\nmangoes, watermelon, vegetables, guavas etic;  \\n\\uf0b7 The GCs will be facilitated to provide e -commerce, bank -agent banking, cold storage facilities and \\nfood processing and agricultural value -chain creation; and  \\n\\uf0b7 The GCs will be a hub of dynamic rural economy, restoring environment and adding beauty to \\nlandscape. It will support supply -chain and add value to farm and non -farm products.  \\nRural Water Supply & Sanitation   \\nWater supply and sanitation is an important an in tegral part of My Village -My Town . The following \\nstrategies and targets will be undertaken during the 8FYP:  \\n\\uf0b7 A piped water supply has been targeted in the densely populated villages; the strategy will be \\ndifferent in villages where households are located s parsely. Such initiative must follow an in -depth \\nstudy on the beneficiaries’ regarding the ‘willingness to pay’ for the service;   \\n\\uf0b7 The priority will be given to 117 arsenic -prone Upazilas and salinity -prone coastal Upazilas;  \\n\\uf0b7 Pond digging will be extended in coastal areas for safe water supply;  \\n\\uf0b7 Improved latrine will gradually replace the ‘pit latrine’. In the 8FYP, the target is to increase \\ncoverage from 61% to 70%; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Suitable strategies will be undertaken for faecal  sludge management in rural areas.    \\n \\n456 \\n Rural Waste Management  \\n The waste management strategies in the rural areas include:  \\n\\uf0b7 The rural community will be involved in waste management. Awareness campaign will be done \\nat all community levels;  \\n\\uf0b7 Two business models of waste management – degradable and r ecyclable – will be developed, \\ninvolving the UPs in 100 UPZs at the beginning;  \\n\\uf0b7 A business model will be developed for waste management at 500 GCs, initially.  \\nUpazila Development/Master Plan  \\nTransformation of the villages will require careful justification  and planned land -use. Looking at challenges \\nin urban areas, the following strategies and targets will be undertaken for UPZs Master Plan under 8FYP \\nperiod:  \\n\\uf0b7 Relevant ministries/agencies will develop National Physical Plan by 2022;  \\n\\uf0b7 The UPZ Master Plan will  target the long -term strategic plan, mid -term sectoral plan and short -\\nterm detailed area plan by 2025 for 250 UPZs (by 2030 for all). Prioritize the list based on existing \\ngrowth, environmental sensitivity, and development potentials; and  \\n\\uf0b7 UPZs will be ade quately staffed with the posts of ‘Senior Planner’ and associates to enforce the \\nmaster plan;  \\nCommunity Space and Recreational Facilities in Villages  \\nFor an inclusive development, adequate communal facilities for children, adolescents, youths and elderly \\nwill be promoted.

To align this overall goal with the SDGs, RDCD will also seek \\nto reduce proportion of the rural population living in poverty, reduce inequality , and enhance  agricultural \\nproductivity and incomes of ru ral population. Human resource development, promoting rural organization, \\nrural capital services, community capacity building, etc. can stimulate rural economy and facilitate the \\nopportunities that will improve social and economic condition of the rural pe ople. In view of this goal, the \\nfollowing ob jectives will be achieved by RDCD in the 8FYP  \\nOverall Objectives of RD CD for the 8FYP   \\nThe major o bjectives and targets of the RDCD for the 8FYP are:  \\n(1) Facilitate rural growth and diversify economy for the pro motion of employment and income \\ngeneration;  \\n(2) Reduce rural poverty focusing on the vulnerable rural population;  \\n(3) Ensure balanced development across districts, with a particular focus on the poor region;  \\n(4) Promote cooperative activities in productio n and financial resource pooling; and  \\n(5) Ensure linkage among farmers, non -farm employees and markets for marketing products.  \\nStrategic Priorities  for RDCD  \\nRDCD has been assigned for coordination of the rural development and relevant activities both at po licy \\nand implementation level. The most prioritized strategies for the comprehensive rural development are – \\nrural infrastructure and connectivity, Capacity development for rural community, extension of capital   \\n \\n458 \\n services, rural livelihood mapping, creation of livelihood village, market linkage for rural products with \\nrural e -commerce, beneficiary database, mainstreaming women for development, Rural Development \\nCentral Database, etc.  The RDCD works in full coordination with the LGD that has responsibility for  \\ndelivery of both urban and rural infrastructures . The urban infrastructure strategy and policies are discussed \\nin great detail in Chapter 9 that deals with urbanization.  The rural infrastructure strategies and policies are \\ndiscussed here.  \\nSome strategies  are given below:  \\nCapacity development for rural community: To enhance community capacity, focus will be given to \\ndevelop Human Resources, Networking among all relevant Stakeholders in rural area, leadership \\ndevelopment and institutional capacity developme nt. Rural people should be able to set their community \\ngoal, initiate actions to achieve it and evaluate it.  \\nExtension of Capital Services: Mobilizing local resources and its effective utilization has its importance in \\nrural production.  Besides providing  capital support as credit or grant to the rural people can generate \\nincome a nd employment opportunities. RDCD through its agencies will continue to provide micro credit, \\nSME credit and supportive linkage facilities for the income generating activities and  small entrepreneurship \\ndevelopment.  \\nRural Livelihood Mapping: Under the 8FYP endeavour  will be made by BRDB to accomplish Rural \\nLivelihood Mapping and publish the ‘Livelihoodpedia of Bangladesh. It will be a comprehensive \\npublication as well as an open so urce database comprising the detail information about traditional and \\nprominent livelihoods of rural Bangladesh. The, rural development and poverty alleviation stakeholders \\nmay utilize the mapping and the database to facilitate the development efforts.  \\nCreation of Livelihood Village: In the process of training -credit -production -marketing several livelihood -\\nbased villages (Duck Village, Carpentry Village, Embroidery Village, Tailoring Village, etc.) have been \\ndeveloped in different rural area of Bangladesh. This concept of ‘Livelihood Village’ piloted and promoted \\nby “Gaibandha Integrated Rural Poverty Alleviation (GIRPA) Project” of BRDB will further be promoted \\nand patronized based on the opportunity, Capability, geographical location, market option, etc. BRDB will \\ndevelop 128 Livelihood Village within the 8FYP period.  \\nMarket Linkage for Rural Products with Rural E -Commerce: Along with infrastructure the organized and \\nefficient market linkage facilities will be developed with the provision of corporate marke ting. Frequent \\n‘Rural Product Fair’ will be organized by BRDB under the  supervision and guidance of RDCD. Branding \\nand promotion strategies will be integrated to market linkage program. The provision of ‘E -Commerce for \\nRural Product’ will be explored and e stablished with the support of concern stakeholders.   \\nRural Development Central Database: A central beneficiary database system should be developed for rural \\ndevelopment activities which will be administered by RDCD. BRDB will be responsible to give the in put \\nof field level data and manage it at field level. All the rural development stakeholders will use this database \\nfor service delivery and other respective functions.  \\n   \\n \\n459 \\n IT Access Development for rural Area:  The rural area will be enabled to use the IT fac ilities so that the \\npeople can utilize it for communication, information, online services, ecommerce and other relevant \\nservices. BRDB will establish some of its rural development societies as IT centre  in the village in a \\nparticipatory manner. BRDB will t rain the eligible member of the selected societies on ICT and will \\ncoordinate them with UP and NBDs.  \\nWomen Empowerment:  As the Rural development strategy of Bangladesh emphasizes focus on poor along \\nwith women, B RDB and other agencies under RD CD will intro duce different types of development \\nactivities under the 8FYP for women empowerment and bring them in the mainstream of the rural society. \\nThe focus area for women empowerment activities will be training, post training support, market linkage, \\nleadership d evelopment, income generating activities etc. There will be coordinated effort with concern \\nstakeholders for reducing dowry, child marriage, evils of eve -teasing for women empowerment and gender \\nparity in the rural area.  \\nRural storage facilities:  There are not enough storage facilities in the rural area. As a result, most of the \\nfarm ers sell their crop and get low  price for their products crop in the harvesting period. On the other hand, \\nprice of the same product become higher in the dull season. Sometimes , it is needed to import from outside \\nof the country which spend foreign currency and consumers become loser due to high price. BRDB \\nenvisioned to provide rural storage facilities for group/society based farmers in the rural area under 8FYP \\nto ensure short  time preservation and fair price for producer and consumers.  \\nSocial Safety net:  Social Safety net programmes  in Bangladesh have been contributing to poverty lessening \\nand reducing vulnerability of rural people groups through various dimension including in come generating \\nactivities, employment creation, training, capital supply, capital fo rmation, food security etc.  RD CD \\nprojected to extend  its social safety net programmes  under 8FYP with abovementioned dimension.  \\nSocio Cultural Development : Socio culture is a part of development, peace and harmony in rural area. \\nCulture and heritage and sports have been included in the ‘National Rural Development Policy -2001’. To \\nthis end indigenous local culture and sports will be promoted and a congenial atmosphere will be created \\nfor those events. RD CD, through its agencies, will take initiative and patronize the socio cultural activities. \\nInitiative will be taken to arrange sports competition among the rural development societies, hosting the \\njoint cultural event by the  societies and UPs and promote the social capital in rural area.  \\nLand Use Planning & Land Zoning: Bangladesh is a least developed country and its economy is based on \\nagriculture. Among the natural resources, land and soil are the key resource for agricultu re. Bangladesh is \\nconsidered as one of the most densely populated country in the context of land -man ratio. Improper and \\nunplanned utilization of land demands proper land zone classes in Bangladesh by maintaining the soil health \\nand rational use of land an d soil. As such, initiative will be taken jointly with local people, BRDB, DAE \\nand other agencies to develop land use plan under the UP. Residential, commercial and agricultural use of \\nland will be demarcated. Such proper and efficient use of land will be prioritized for sustainable \\ndevelopment.  \\nRural Housing:  Housing, which is one of the basic needs for human being, is scarce in rural Bangladesh. \\nGovernment of Bangladesh has already taken a number of initiatives to provide low cost rural housing \\nfacilities  to the rural poor. Rural housing is a new concept by which multi -storied buildings will be \\nconstructed on a comparatively small piece of land at a convenient rural area so that many more rural people   \\n \\n460 \\n can live there together. Nowadays, rural housing progra mmes  are being implemented through many NGOs \\nin the country. As an important organization of RDCD, Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) is \\nalso capable enough to implement rural housing purpose of the government. Regarding rural housing \\nprogram, BRDB has already participated a series of discussion with relevant authorities. BRDB has also a \\nplan to implement the program during this 8th 5-year period.     \\nRural micro -infrastructure development : RDCD has the mandate to promote overall socio -economic \\ndevel opment and poverty reduction of the rural areas covering \\'para\\' (small part of village), villages, wards \\nand unions by implementing various micro -infrastructure development schemes. LGD implements only \\nfeeder roads type - B which connect upazila headquarte rs to feeder roads type – A and upazila headquarters \\nto growth centres . Other than aforementioned infrastructures, small level infrastructures like installation of \\ndeep tube -wells, construction of small roads, culverts etc. are neither been included into t he program of \\nLGD nor the any other agency. As a significant organization of RDCD, BRDB has been implementing \\nmicro -infrastructure development schemes at rural areas by Participatory Rural Development system since \\n2000. A huge number of micro -infrastructur e development schemes have already been successfully \\nimplemented across the country. In presence of LGRD&C Minister, who is also the Chairperson of BRDB, \\nit has been decided to mainstreaming the construction of rural micro infrastructure through Participat ory \\nRural Development system in the 45th board meeting in 2012. The mainstreaming initiatives are on the \\nprocess by which rural micro -infrastructure development activities will be done with revenue budget aiming \\nto ensure a balanced rural development by 20 41. BRDB has already approached the Finance Division \\nthrough RDCD, to create a micro infrastructure code in favour of BRDB under revenue budget head, so \\nthat BRDB could implement the rural micro -infrastructure program on a regular basis.  \\nRural Small and M edium Enterprises (SMEs):  Small and medium enterprises are playing a major role in \\nthe economy of Bangladesh, particularly in rural economy. But most of the SMEs could not make \\nsignificant success due to many difficulties such as lack of necessary funds, l ocal level technology, \\npatronization etc. There are some private and non -government initiatives to meet the difficulties of SMEs \\nbut those are very insufficient. With directions of RDCD, BRDB has been providing many supports like \\nfunds, training, technolog y, raw materials etc. to make the rural SMEs sustainable though several projects \\nuplifting the rural socio -economic conditions. Through upazila level offices, BRDB is now formulating \\nformal and informal groups, providing capital supports, skill development  training, and necessary  \\ntechnologies to the group members to smoothly run the SMEs. During the period of this 8th five-year, BRDB \\nwill undertake some more initiatives to develop and patronize the country\\'s rural SMEs.            \\nDevelopment of Rural Energ y: Rural energy sector can play a vital role in the development of rur al life \\nstandard. There is fewer  electrification facility in some remote rural areas especially char and hilly areas of \\nBangladesh. Now some NGOs are working in these remote rural char a nd hilly areas to provide energy like \\nsolar energy. These energy facilities provided by the NGOs are not cost effective and feasible. As the \\nmother organization of RDCD, BRDB is now working at every corner of these remote rural char and hilly \\nareas with it s existing manpower and organizational network. So, BRDB will be able to easily extend the \\nenergy providing assistance to the mentioned remote areas of Bangladesh. During the upcoming 8th five-\\nyear period, BRDB will undertake necessary development initiati ves to provide low cost energy facilities \\nin a feasible way to the less -facilitated communities of those remote areas.  \\nAgricultural Mechanization:  Mechanization is an important tool for profitable and competitive agriculture. \\nThe need for mechanization is  increasing fast with the decrease of draft power. Without mechanization it \\nwill not be possible to maintain multiple cropping patterns, which need quick land preparation, planting,   \\n \\n461 \\n weeding, harvesting, processing etc. In all cases, the traditional method involves a lot of money and time. \\nNevertheless, in the modern mechanical system, the cost comes down to somewhere half to somewhere a \\nquarter.  Mechanization services will provide to the farmers through Krishok Samobay Samitee (KSS). \\nThose services include distribution of different agricultural machinery including harvesting , planting, \\nprocessing of crops  and packaging  in a participatory manner with the KSS. Alongside this endeavour  will \\nbe made to sensitize the rural farmers to use this technology and also training will be imparted for the \\nutilization and repair of the machineries.  \\nClimate Change and Environment Management : Bangladesh has been suffering tremendously due to \\nconsequences of climate change. A setting in the tropics, in the floodplain delta of t he three major river \\nbasins - the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna, and extensive low floodplain topography with a \\nlow lying coast line, has rendered the country prone to a multitude of natural hazards (e.g. floods, droughts, \\nstorm surge, salt water  intrusion, river erosion, etc.) and vulnerable to the adverse impacts of future change \\nin climatic conditions. For the mitigation and adaptation of the climate change consequences necessary \\nmeasures will be taken in the rural area.   \\nEnvironment friendly utilization of land and natural resources of development of rural environment will be \\nensured. With a view to preserve ecological balance and prevent indiscriminate damage of soil, forests, \\nwater ways and animals, regulatory measures will be taken and prop er application of the National \\nEnvironment law will be assisted. Necessary measures will be taken to scale down the use of chemical \\nfertilizers and insecticides and increase the use of organic manure in agriculture. Social movement for \\nmotivating rural peo ple to actively contribute to environmental sustainability, live healthy lives and prevent \\npollution of soil, water and air will be strengthened. Initiative will also be taken to waste management in \\nrural area in a participatory manner.  EngineSafe water of  630 Nos.

The \\nfoundation will seek to create employment opp ortunities and income generating activities of small and \\nmarginal farmers through access to microcredit, capital formation through small savings, and market \\nlinkages.  \\nPalli Daridro Bimochon Foundation  (PDBF)  \\nThe objectives PDBF include  socio -economic devel opment of the poor and the underprivileged people \\nthrough training, capital formulation, women empowerment.  \\nDuring 8th plan period, PDBF will undertake activities on creation of small entrepreneurs, and self -\\nemployment programmes, awareness and skills deve lopment of rural youths with special focus on the poor \\nand vulnerable groups in rural areas.   \\nMilk Producers’ Cooperative Union Limited (MilkVita)  \\n\\uf0b7 The objectives of the Milk Vita are  socio -economic development of small, marginal and landless \\nfarmers throug h production, processing, and marketing of milk and dairy product.  \\n\\uf0b7 During 8th plan period, Milk Vita will undertake programmes to form new milk cooperatives; to \\nalleviate poverty through cow rearing, milk collection, processing and distribution and to wom en \\nempowerment by off -farm activities.  \\n8FYP Strategy for RDCD  \\nPromote diversified rural economy:  Along with efforts to improve productivity and diversity within \\nagriculture, the on-going  rural transformation whereby the income share of rural population f rom non -farm \\nactivities is growing will be further strengthened to provide a diversified income and employment base for \\nthe rural population.  The details of this strategy were provided in chapters 2 and 4 of Part 1 of the Plan \\ndocument. The details of the  agricultural strategy were discussed in Chapter 3 o f Part 2 of the Plan \\ndocument. Supportive policies include the implementation of BDP2100, public investment in farm \\ntechnology and productivity, support policies for strengthening fishing activities inclu ding the harnessing \\nof the potentials of the Blue Economy, public investment in rural infrastructure, and credit policies to \\npromote non -farm economic activities.    \\n \\n464 \\n Ensure balanced rural development: The government is acutely aware of the many lagging rural areas of \\nBangladesh. Special efforts will be made to reduce some of the gaps during the 8FYP by improving \\ninfrastructure, giving priority to the needs of these lagging areas in allocating public spending on agriculture \\nand water management, and improving t he flow of credit to these areas to boost non -farm enterprises.  The \\nactivities of the various rural support institutions will prioritize these lagging regions in designing their \\nprogrammes  for the 8FYP.  \\nStrengthen rural education, training and skill form ation:  The implementation of the Non -Formal Education \\nstrategy will be strengthened to eliminate rural adult illiteracy for both males and females, increase rural \\neducation coverage and quality, and provide skills training through the various rural support  institutions.  \\nThe training will provide skills development training to the rural poor, particularly disadvantaged women \\nand socially excluded groups, to generate self -employment in non -farm sectors.

The Ministry of LGRD&C will lead the donor coordination on behalf of the major \\ngove rnment stakeholders: LGD and RD CD, Planning Commission, Finance Division, Ministry of \\nAgriculture, Road  Transport  and Highways Division and the Ministry of Commerce. The coordination with \\nDPs is very important as there is a number of Sector Working Groups (SWG) under the Local Consultative  \\nGroup (LCG). Without proper coordination, there is a risk of duplication and supply -driven donor activities.  \\nThe functioning of the various SWGs of the DPs and the lead government counterparts is shown in \\nfollowing Table 7. 5. The Local Government Divisio n (LGD) assumes the leading roles in local govern ance, \\nwater supply and sanitation, and urban sector. The Ministry of Agriculture takes the lead on agriculture and \\nrural development; the Road Transport and  Highways Division on roads issues; the Ministry of  Commerce \\nassumes the responsibility of commerce and businesses, private  sector and trade; and the Ministry of \\nChittagong Hill Tracts  Affairs  on CHT matters.  Given the involvement of MoLGRD&C in rural \\ndevelopment, rural roads, rural CMSEs and CHT rural in frastructure, the MoLGRD&C departments will \\nensure proper coordination with the concerned line ministries to ensure donor coordination and maximize \\nthe support benefits.  \\nTable 7. 5: Development Partners and Sectors Working Groups  \\nSl Development Partner  Work ing Group  \\n(Lead Ministry/Division)  \\n1.

This economic \\ntransformation was only possible as the country entered a high growth regime of above 7. 6% over the last \\n4 years. This also me ant that Bangladesh experienced a steep decline in both moderate and extreme poverty. \\nFurthermore, this pro -poor economic transformation coincided with sustained reductions in child mortality \\nand fertility, improvements in life expectancy and nutritional s tatus of the population, enhanced access to \\nelectricity, sanitation and clean water, and broad -based expansions in education.  \\nLooking into the future, policymakers aim to increase growth from 8.15% in FY19 to 8.51% in FY25 and \\nsustain an average economic growth rate of 9% between FY21 to FY41 in order to attain a High -Income  \\nCountry status by FY41. This long -term aspiration of development, however, necessitates that Bangladesh \\nreconciles its strategies for growth and social development with renewed attenti on to nature, climate, and \\nthe underlying economic system that made our economy unsustainable and exposed to pollution, \\ndegradation of environment and ecosystem risk to climate and disaster risk . Therefore, the 8FYP recognizes \\nBangladesh’s commitment to Ri o Convention, Paris Agreeme nt and  Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk \\nReduction and Sustainable  Development  Goals.  While some developing countries have championed the \\nnotion of “grow dirty, clean up later”, the Government of Bangladesh understands and acknow ledges that \\ngrowth can only be sustainable when it is green in nature – vis-à-vis – “Green Growth”. This is because, \\nwhile the measures associated with environmental conservation might appear economically burdensome in \\nthe very short -run, the likelihood of  maintaining fast -paced long -run growth in the absence of \\nenvironmental conservation is low due to the loss of capital stock as a result of ecosystem degr adation such \\nas land degradation, soil erosion, flooding, loss of land fertility and health hazards du e to air and water and \\nsoil pollution. The return of investment on resilient and environmentally  sustainable  development is high \\nwhen developme nt processes are transformed  into sustainable  pathways.  \\nIn fact, at the macro -level, indicative projections prese nted in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100  (BDP2100)  \\nhighlight ed that the combined effects of moderate climate change could cause an average loss of about \\n1.3% in the growth of GDP per year until FY2041. The time paths for the GDP growth in the case of \\nuncheck ed environmental degradation (termed Business -As-Usual or BAU) and for the case where all \\nnecessary actions to protect the environment including the adoption of the (BDP 2100 are taken (termed \\nthe Policy Scenario), also highlight a substantial cost associa ted with environmental neglect.   \\nThe cumulative gap in per capita income between the two scenarios grows progressively, and by FY2041 \\n– the gap can be as high as 27%. This will also have substantial implications for poverty. In fact, in 2015, \\nthe Governme nt of Bangladesh estimated that damages from five major natural disasters since 1998 \\namounts to roughly 15% of GDP – while a joint work by the Government of Bangladesh and the World   \\n \\n472 \\n Bank in 2010 indicated that climate related disasters accounted for 0.5 to  1% loss of GDP annually due to \\ndamages in livelihood, infrastructure and forgone production and likely to grow further unless policies and \\ninvestments are made to manage the negative impact of climate change and envir onmental degradation. \\nEnvironmental ha zards due to both climate change and economic activities have severe implications for \\npublic health as well, as increasing heat propagates new pests and disease vectors, air pollution and health \\nhazards like malaria, dengue plus water borne diseases hinder  health conditions. In a broad perspective, \\nproactive investments to manage those stress and potential disruption make  credible economic performance. \\nClimate change through floods and the erosion of land can also lead to a situation involving climate \\nrefug ees, caused by mass migration to urban centres, resulting in hasty and carbon intensive urbanization \\nand poor living conditions.  \\nThe Government recognizes this key role of environmental sustainability for making economic \\ntransformation meaningful . Moreove r, since its inception, Bangladesh has already attained a good degree \\nof climate resilience, especially in mitigating and adapting to natural disasters by mobilizing critical \\ninvestments in climate resilient technologies and infrastructure and it  and ackno wledges the need for turning \\nBangladesh into a climate -resilient and environmentally sound country. In particular, to facilitate the \\njourney to an Upper -Middle -Income Country status by FY2031 and a High -Income Country by FY2041, it \\nis essential that substa ntial further steps are taken to ensure that the natural environment in Bangladesh \\nresembles those of the high -income economies by 2041. To this end, the Sustainable Development Goals \\nand the Perspective Plan  2021 -2041 have pointed out specific objectives and targets – illustrated in Tables, \\n8.1 and 8. 2 – which aim to reconcile environmental concerns with our socio -economic aspirations. The \\ntargets, nonetheless, underscore the strong leap we need in terms of addressing environmental management \\nchallenges wh ile moving forward. This is mainly due to substandard performances in the past. In fact, even \\nvery recently, Bangladesh has ranked poorly in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (162 out \\nof 180) by Yale and Columbia University . Bangladesh has als o been ranked as the 7th most vulnerable on \\nthe Climate Risk Index in 2020. As a result , the ability to address the environmental challenges will \\ndetermine our scope to achieve High -Income Country status and eliminate the incidence of absolute poverty \\nby FY2041.  \\nThe Eighth Five Year Plan will focus on integrating economic progress, environment, climate change and \\ndisaster management concerns into planning and budgeting with the goal of attaining sustainable \\ndevelopment. In this context, appropriate policy and institutional capacity building for sustainable water \\nand land management, biodiversity conservation, climate resilient development and disaster management \\nare crucial at all levels of government, especially with a greater emphasis at the local governm ent level \\nwhere most of the programmes are to be implemented. The Eighth Plan will also incorporate a strategy of \\ngreen growth to harmonize economic growth for better environmental sustainability.  \\nTherefore, the Eighth Plan envisions a sustainable develop ment agenda, and is focused accordingly on \\nsynchronizing economic and environment planning to produce coherent decision making on both economic \\nand environmental fronts. It highlights the need to address the environment, climate change adaptation and \\nmitig ation, and disaster risk reduction in a broader development context, recognizing the environmental \\nconcerns as an added challenge to reducing poverty, hunger, diseases and facilitating growth. Of course, \\nsome of the objectives and activities that were cons idered under the Sixth and Seventh Plans but were not \\naddressed or implemented adequately have also found consideration under the Eighth Plan, as long as they \\nhave an instrumental role in aiding the key objectives of the Plan and the long -term agendas arti culated in \\nthe Perspective Plan 2041.    \\n \\n473 \\n Table 8. 1: Perspective Plan  2021 -2041 Objectives for Environmental Sector  \\nI. Some 80 per  cent of the population lives in urban areas and enjoys a quality of life that is comparable to \\nthose found in the present -day high -income economies.  \\nII.  There is a proper balance between ecology, the natural environment and needs of the population. In \\nparticular, the productivity of land is preserved, forest resources are conserved and enriched, biodiversity \\nand air quality are improved,  pollution level is decreased and water resources are properly managed to \\nprevent flooding and water shortages.  \\nIII. Cities are normally flood free with proper drainage, modern sewerage, proper waste management and \\nclean air.  \\nIV. There is minima l incidence of absol ute poverty;  there are no slums and every household have a basic \\nminimum housing quality.  \\nV. The country is equipped to respond fully and quickly to any incidence of natural disasters.  \\nVI. Environmental governance is such whereby there is a sound mix of incentive s and regulatory policies \\nincluding the application of the polluter pays principle and a decentralized implementation of \\nenvironmental policies and programmes.  \\nSource:  PP2041,  GED   \\n \\nTable 8. 2: Core Targets for Environmental Management  \\nObjectives / Target s Base Year \\n(2018 ) Target \\n(2041 ) \\nShare of urban population in total population (%)  30 80 \\nUrban households with tap water connectivity (%)  40 100 \\nUrban households with water -sealed sanitary toilets (%)  42 100 \\nUrban households with modern sewerage connec tion (%)  N/A 100 \\nRural households with tap water connectivity (%)  0 50 \\nRural households with water -sealed sanitary toilets (%)  0 50 \\nRural households with safe sewerage connection  0 100 \\nIncidence of absolute poverty (%)  24 < 3%  \\nPer cent of population l iving in slums (%)  \\nPer cent  of household living in slums (UN definition)  55 0 \\nPer cent  of urban centres with waste water treatment facilities  N/A 100 \\nCore environmental spending (% of GDP)  1 3.5 \\nSpending by environment coordinating entity (% of GDP)  0.005 0.5 \\nApplication of polluter pays principle (% of cases)  0 100 \\nCarbon tax (% of fuel prices)  0 15 \\nGreen area for Dhaka -major cities (square metres /million people)  N/A 5-12 \\nDisaster readiness (%)  N/A 100 \\nUrban water bodies compliance with water quali ty standards (%)  0 100 \\nAir quality (annual average, µg/m3 PM 2.5)  86 40 \\nPer cent  of cities flood free with proper drainage  0 100 \\nPer cent  of land degraded  18 5 \\nArea under forest cover (% of land)  [base year 2015]  14.1 20 \\nProtection of Habitat and Biod iversity International Ranking  Bottom 5%  Top 30%  \\nEnvironmental Performance Index International Ranking  Bottom 5%  Top 30%  \\nSource: PP2041 Projections.

Moreo ver, to address these \\nchallenges, the government prepared some key strategic plans and laws to introduce more harmony into \\neconomic planning. In 2009, it adopted the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan \\n(BCCSAP). Moreover, a National Strategy  for Sustainable Development (NSDS) 2010 -2021 was formally \\nadopted in 2013, which aimed to integrate environmental management while pursuing the broader \\nobjectives of the Perspective Plan 2010 -2021. At present, an impressive list of environmental laws, \\nregulations and plans cover a wide range of environmental issues including forest degradation, air pollution, \\nwater pollution, bio -diversity loss and wetland management. Additional laws, regulations and programmes \\nrelated to agriculture, land, water managemen t, fisheries and disaster management also seek to address \\nenvironmental concerns in areas, such as land degradation, sustainable management of fisheries, \\nmanagement of water resources, waste management and disaster risk reduction. The Government has also \\nundertaken specific measures during  the 7FYP to improve the state of environmental management, which \\nare as follows:  \\n8.2.1  Plan, Policy, Strategy  \\nThe government has adopted a medium - term strategy and has developed plans and policies to implement \\nthe strat egy.  The main elements are as follows.  \\nNational Environment Policy 2018: The Government has promulgated the National Environment Policy \\n2018 as refinement of the Environment Policy 1992 in order to ensure sustainable development and bring \\nthe environment into the mainstream of national development by reflecting the issues of protection and \\nimprovement of environment and biodiversity. This policy will be considered as an integrated policy for \\nthe protection and improvement of environment and will serve as g uidelines for all environmental activities \\nstated in all other policies.  \\nEcologically Critical Areas (ECAs) Management Rules 2016: The Government has declared thirteen \\nbiodiversity significant areas which are ecologically vulnerable and degraded as ECAs t o halt its continuous \\ndegradation. Considering the value of these Ecosystems, Bangladesh government has promulgated \\nEcologically Critical Areas Management Rules 2016, for its proper management and improvement of the \\necosystem. The rules set out several com mittees namely: National ECA Committee, District ECA \\nCommittee, Upzila and Union ECA Committee in different tiers for management of the ECAs.  \\nNational Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), 2016 -2021  \\nBangladesh enjoys a very rich diversity of flora  and fauna in a wider range of ecosystems. The economy of \\nthe country and the people are heavily dependent on the biological resources for their lives and livelihoods. \\nOur cultural heritage, rural lifestyles and traditional healthcare have long been attach ed to the services \\nprovided by the biodiversity. To ensure our rich biodiversity be conserved and used sustainably, we need \\nto follow the updated NBSAP formulated in 2016. NBSAP reflects well thought of actions and strategies \\nof implementation in line with  global targets and Biological Diversity Act of the country. As the NBSAP   \\n \\n475 \\n serves as a guiding document for management of country’s biodiversity and there is obligation under the \\nBiological Diversity Act to develop and update the document on a regular inter val, the development projects \\nand programmes  taken and implemented during 8FYP should address the NBSAP, 2016 -2021 targets those \\nare also linked with SDG targets. Department of Environment will update or revise the NBSAP with the \\nupcoming Global Biodiversi ty Framework to be adopted for the duration of 2021 -2030.  \\nBangladesh Biological Diversity Act, 2017  \\nGovernment enacted the Bangladesh Biological Diversity Act in 2017 to materialize the constitutional \\nobligation of biodiversity conservation as well as, our  global commitment that enshrined in the three \\nobjectives of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Towards full implementation of the \\nAct on Biodiversity, strengthened institutional structure under the Department of Environment will be \\nrequired. The Act will facilitate conservation activities in every tier of the local government and up to the \\ngrass root level with the formation of biodiversity committees, establishment of biodiversity register and \\nbiodiversity fund to be established by the  government.  \\nBiosafety Policy of Bangladesh  \\nTo enhance the implementation of biosafety regulatory regime, a development project on implementation \\nof the National Biosafety Framework (NBF) has been taken to enhance the capacity on biosafety at various \\nlevels. A GMO detection laboratory has already been established in the Department of Environment to \\nsupport the regulatory system. As a party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, Government of \\nBangladesh intends to fulfil the commitments under that internat ional agreement, including the use of risk \\nassessment to inform decision making on the use of GMOs, and supporting efforts to ensure public \\nawareness on biosafety. Biosafety Policy has been formulated both in English and Bangla with a view to \\ninstitutional izing a stand -alone policy that has the vision for biosafety applicable for handling GMOs, \\nincluding research under containment in the laboratory, field trial, trans -boundary movement, transit, and \\nany uses of GMOs that may have adverse effects on the cons ervation and sustainable use of biological \\ndiversity, taking also into account risks to human and animal health.  \\nFormulation of National Oil and Chemical Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCOP) : Being a river -\\nfloodplain -prolific country, there is a high traffic mo vement in the waterways, both inland and the coast \\nand marine. The pollution from blow -out, collision, stranding, and other inland and marine accidents can \\nthreaten marine life including marine fisheries in the coast, inter -tidal zones and in the deep sea;  coastal \\nmangroves and vegetations; fisheries including aquatic life in the rivers, floodplains and wetlands; \\nagricultural products; inland and sea birds; recreational beaches; and tourism with subsequent loss of \\nrevenue. Furthermore, the Bangladeshi coast , its EEZ in the Bay of Bengal, area of High Sea within the \\nnational maritime border is close to multiple international shipping routes that expose the country to \\npossible spillage incidents. Considering the additional ship -breaking activities and proximit y of oil, \\npetroleum, and chemical processing industries on the coastal belt present substantial commercial activity \\nand hazards that may cause spillage. National Oil and Chemical Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCOP) is being \\nformulated both in Bangla and in Eng lish to combat water pollution both in the inland water and in the \\ncoastal and marine water.    \\n \\n476 \\n Improved Management in Wildlife Conservation and Protection: The Government has formulated a \\nwide array of measures to implement the Wildlife (conservation and sec urity) Act, 2012. The Government \\nhas also formulated a Wildlife Conservation Master Plan 2015 -2035, which charts out a long -term plan to \\nimprove the conservation of wildlife in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Tiger Action Plan (2018 -2027), \\nBangladesh Elephant Conse rvation Action Plan (2018 -2027), Bangladesh Vulture Conservation Action \\nPlan (2016 -2025) have been formulated. Several projects to address the plans to protect and conserve the \\nwildlife are under implementation.    \\nAdoption of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 : Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 documents the broad \\ndevelopment strategies which the country can adopt as it gravitates toward the end of the 21st century. It \\noffers long -term strategies and interventions that should be embraced in order to ensure food and wa ter \\nsecurity, economic progress and environmental sustainability while reducing the threats of natural disasters \\nand developing resilience to climate change by putting forward a set of forward -looking integrated \\nstrategies, which is both holistic and multi -dimensional in nature. In some sense, the Delta Plan 2100 is a \\ntechno -economic plan which covers both technical and economic issues, and it evaluates the needs of \\nmobilizing resources for an effective investment programme till 2030. It also harnesses an a pproach of \\nAdaptive Delta Management (ADM) by having a strong focus on the issues associated with climate change, \\nsuch as rise in global temperature, erratic patterns of rainfall patterns, rise in sea levels, etc.  \\nMore precisely, BDP 2100 charts out the pa thways of development under two distinct policy options: The \\nBusiness -as Usual  (BAU) policy option and the Delta Plan (DP) policy option. Under the BAU policy \\noption, the impact of climate change is projected to be unmitigated, resulting in increased natur al hazard \\nand lower long -run growth – as the efficiency of capital falls due to lower agricultural production, higher \\nhealth hazards and increased pressure for urbanization. On the other hand, under the Delta Plan (DP) policy \\noption, the effects of climate  change are expected to be minimized, and associated adaptation measures are \\nplanned which will help us achieve higher economic growth. Furthermore, under the DP policy, Bangladesh \\nis projected to achieve Upper Middle -Income Country status by 2031 and High -Income  country by 2041.  \\nBDP 2100 also links Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) to economic growth as water has \\nbeen considered for the sustainability of the delta. Key components of IWRM cover the impacts of climate \\nchange, food and water secur ity, economic and social progress, knowledge development, expansion of \\nforest and tree area, biodiversity conservation, crop production, etc. Additionally, this alignment with \\nIWRM allows BDP 2100 to pursue the goals that are critical for long -run sustaina ble development, which \\nare: ensuring safety from climate change related disasters; address efficiency gaps in water usage and \\nsecurity; ensure the conservation of wetlands and develop an integrated system; attain optimal use of land \\nand water resources; an d create institutions that can generate the cooperation which is necessary for in -\\ncountry and trans -boundary water resource management – and they are collectively aligned with the aims \\nof the SDGs.  \\nIt is also essential to underscore that the formulation of  the BDP 2100 went through an extensive \\nconsultative process and was based on twenty -six baseline studies on key areas such as climate change, \\nnatural resources, environment and ecology, review of past experiences, environmental governance, \\nknowledge and d ata management. Consequently, the challenges lie with effective implementation – and the \\nkey areas of concern are: mobilizing resources for supporting the investment plan, developing capacities at \\ndifferent stages of the Government; achieving the necessary  coordination between, among and within   \\n \\n477 \\n agencies and Ministries and Divisions; aligning delta implementation activities with the Annual \\nDevelopment Programme (ADP); and designing appropriate mode of financing for Public -Private \\nPartnership (PPP) related pr ojects and also new projects address climate change adaptation.  \\nNAP, BCCSAP, CIP , NDC , FIP and FMP :  The Government has initiated the process to formulate \\nNational Adaptation Plan  (NAP)  in 2019 with the support from GCF -UNDP and steered by MoEFCC. \\nSimilarl y, MoEFCC has initiated the process to update Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action \\nPlan (BCCSAP), 2009, which was supposed to be completed by this time, but could not be completed due \\nto COVID -19 pandemic. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC),  which was prepared and submitted \\nbefore the Paris Agreement in 2015 is a flagship document of the government, where Bangladesh \\ngovernment decided to reduce GHG emission by 5% from business -as-usual  (BAU)  levels by 2030 or 12 \\nmillion ton of CO2eq in power,  transport and industry sectors. Under conditional contribution with financial \\nand technological support from developed countries, Bangladesh decided to reduce GHG emission by \\nadditional 10% from BAU levels by 2030 or 24 million metric ton CO2eq in those t hree sectors. Besides, \\nMoEFCC has also prepared Climate Investment Plan in 2017 with support from FAO. At present, \\nBangladesh is also formulating the NAP process that is expected to be completed by 2022 with financial \\nsupport from the Green Climate Fund. H owever, all these initiatives need to be aligned and come under one \\numbrella of Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100 to ensure better coordination and sustainability with clear \\nbudget links.  \\nThe Government has also operationalized the Climate Fiscal Framework  (CFF), developed by the Ministry \\nof Finance, which provides the principles and tools for climate fiscal policy -making (CFP), helping to \\nidentify the demand and supply sides of climate fiscal funds (expenditures vis -à-vis revenue or finance, \\nrespectively),  and to ensure that CFP is transparent and sustainable in the longer term. It is also essential to \\nnote that under the 7th Plan period, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG), for the first \\ntime, conducted two pilot performance audits usi ng climate lens with technical support from the Inclusive \\nBudgeting and Financing for Climate Resilience (IBFCR) project of Finance Division.  \\nForest Investment Plan  (FIP)  (2017 -2022) has been developed to identify the future investment opportunities \\nto increase the forest cover, reducing the deforestation and forest degradation, improving the livelihoods of \\nthe forest dependent people through the implementation of participatory/social forestry. An updated Forestry \\nMaster Plan (FMP) has been developed for t he period of 2017 -2036 after the completion of previous FMP \\nin 2015 to address the upcoming and on-going  challenges related to anthropogenic issues and climate change.  \\n8.2.2  Activ ities/Initiatives/Measures  \\nImproved Institutional Capacity:  The Department o f Environment has enhanced its institutional capacity. \\nThe Department discharges its responsibilities through a head office at Dhaka, eight divisional offices \\nlocated in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barishal, Sylhet, Mymenshing and Rangpur.  \\nActivi ties to Mitigate River Bank Erosion : Steps have been taken for managing water resources, land \\nuse, and mitigating effects of climate change on the environment by re -excavating small rivers, canals and \\nwetlands across the country and assimilation of the Cli mate Smart Integrated Coastal Resource Database \\n(CSICRD). The Government has already undertaken plans to increase navigability of rivers, dredging of \\n510 km of rivers by 2022 to prevent river erosion and ensure supply of water during the lean season, diggi ng   \\n \\n478 \\n and re -excavation of 4,883 km of irrigation canals, construction and repair of 200 irrigation structures to \\nextend irrigation facilities, construction of 3 barrages and rubber dams, construction of 250 km flood \\nprotection and coastal embankment to reduc e flood, salinity and water logging, renovation of 1,040 km \\nflood protection embankments and coastal embankments, construction and renovation of 590 flood \\nprotection and drainage infrastructure, excavation and re -excavation of 1,325 km drainage canals, and  \\nconservation work of 195 km border river banks  and 6 cross -dams.  \\nImproved Management to Control Water Pollution: In order to control water pollution, the Government \\nhas banned the use, production and marketing of polyethylene shopping bags and made it ma ndatory for \\nthe industries to set up Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) to treat their waste before discharging them to \\nwater bodies. Unfortunately, the effective enforcement of regulation concerning the ban of plastic is still \\nundermining environmental heal th, which needs more focus under the 8th Plan.  Therefore,  the Department \\nof Environment (DoE) takes legal action against violators including the imposition of penalties  as provided \\nunder the law . The tannery industries operating in Hazaribagh have been re located to the tannery industrial \\nestate in Savar, which will dispose the liquid wastes through a common ETP.  \\nActivities to Reduce Land Degradation:  Bangladesh National Action Program (NAP) for combating \\nDesertification, Land Degradation and Drought (DLDD) , 2015 -2024 has been formulated to support and \\nenhances the implementation of UNCCD strategy 2008 -2018. Its vision is ‘to forge a global partnership to \\nreverse and prevent desertification/land degradation and to mitigate the effect of droughts in the affec ted \\nareas in order to support poverty and environmental sustainability.  \\nTo achieve SDG15.3.1, Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030, Bangladesh set its voluntary national \\nLDN targets. Based on the national commitment to achieve LDN by 2030, 5,100 km2 p reliminary LDN \\ntargets have been defined for Bangladesh . \\nDoE is implementing a number of projects to reduce land degradation and to mainstream sustainable Land \\nManagement (SLM) best practices .  \\nImproved Coastal Afforestation:  During the Seventh Five Year P lan coastal afforestation in newly \\naccreted chars in the coastal areas have been given due emphasis and about 23,818  hecta res plantations \\nhave been raised . Forest Department has conducted a study in 2016 to identify the potential newly accreted \\nchar land a nd suitable barren lands and mapped for bringing under afforestation activity to establish green \\nbelt along the coastal region.  \\nEstablished Forest and Carbon Inventories:  Forest Department conducted National Forest Inventory \\n(NFI) during 2016 -19 to identi fy the status of forest and tree resources, carbon and biomass stock, \\ndependency of local people on trees and forests etc. The result shows that forest cover of Bangladesh is \\n12.8 % of the country. Government estimated the carbon emission for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land \\nUse (AFOLU) sector to develop the Forest Reference Level (FRL) and submitted to the UNFCCC. To \\nreduce the carbon emission from forestry sector, Bangladesh formulated Bangladesh National REDD+ \\nStrategy (BNRS) and established National  Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) for periodical monitoring of \\ntree and forest cover using satellite imagery. Bangladesh Forest Information System (BFIS) is established \\nfor supporting the dissemination of information and data to the stakeholders.    \\n \\n479 \\n Improved Co-management in Protected Areas: Protected Area Management Rules has been formulated \\nin 2017. Forest Department has implemented co -management in 22 protected areas to conserve the wildlife \\nand biodiversity involving the forest dependent communities.  \\nImprov ed Management of Wetlands:  A 20 -year Haor Development Master Plan and Database has been \\nprepared for development of the Haor areas. Under this, steps have been taken in the Haor areas to develop \\ninfrastructure, re -excavate rivers, canals, and Haors, and fo ster socio -economic development of the people \\nof the concerned areas. This Master Plan is essential as haor region has long been lagging behind \\nmainstream national development although the economic development of Bangladesh is moving steadily at \\na moderate  pace. In particular, the Master Plan allows the Government to harness the development \\npotentials by addressing the issues as well as to gain comprehensive understanding on the present \\nhydrological and hydro -morphological characteristics and conditions, la nd-use patterns, ecological \\nsensitivity and water quality situation.  Implementation progress is; however, lagging and stronger efforts \\nwill be needed in the 8FYP.  \\nImproving Transnational Cooperation on Water Management:  The Government has remained \\ncommitt ed to improve transnational cooperation for the management of rivers shared by Bangladesh and \\nits neighbours. It has also signed a Framework Agreement on Cooperation for Development between \\nBangladesh and India in 2011 for water resource management and dev elopment of cross -border rivers \\nthrough sub -regional cooperation, and under the 7FYP  – the Government has taken measures to form an \\norganization based on the Ganges -Brahmaputra -Meghna river basins, such as the River Basin \\nOrganisation/River Basin Commissio n. \\nImproved Data Archiving :  Service Level Agreement (SLA) was done in 2017 with Bangladesh Computer \\nCouncil (BCC) for hosting the Bangladesh Forest Information System (BFIS) for data archiving and sharing \\nthe updated information with stakeholders. Several  information modules were developed and hosted in the \\nBFIS to support the assessment and monitoring the forest resources.   \\nSupporting Alternative Livelihood: The Government has supported more than 10,000 families during the \\n7FYP  to reduce their dependence on forests, which will result in lower illegal logging of timber and \\ndepletion of natural resources. This process has been carried out under different development projects of \\nForest Department  \\nImproved Watershed Management:  Watershed management was one of the prioritized activities of the \\ngovernment. Hill forest area was considered for the improvement of tree cover to regulate the water cycle \\nand reduce the soil erosion.  \\nIncreased Commitment to Social Forestry:  The Government has remained  committed to the o bjectives \\nof social forestry under the 7 FYP as it continued to offer resources to thousands of people under different \\nsocial forestry schemes. At present, more than half a million people are involved with the overall social \\nforestry programme.   Additionall y, encroached forest lands, depleted forest areas, vacant marginal land and \\nroad side areas were reforested during the plan period. The major components of these projects were to \\nestablish woodlot, agro -forestry and strip plantations throughout the country . The Plantations established \\nunder social forestry programme are being harvested at the end of the rotation (10 years) and of which the \\nbenefit will go to the participant.     \\n \\n480 \\n Increased Commitment to Green Growth: During the 7FYP , fiscal initiatives have bee n designed by \\nproviding tax incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy ventures. The incentives include \\nexemption from being charged 15% VAT on renewable energy equipment and materials used in the \\nproduction of renewable energy. The Government has also developed a network of microcredit providers \\nin remote rural areas to provide funding for the purchase of renewable energy equipment; and corporate \\nincome tax exemptions for renewable energy projects.  \\nClimate Fiscal Reforms  \\nIn 2014, the governmen t adopted a Climate Fiscal Framework to mainstream climate finance in the \\ncountries Public Financial Management (PFM) systems and processes encompassing strategic planning, \\nbudget formulation, budget execution, and parliamentary oversight. Already, Finance  Division has \\nintroduced climate dimension in its Medium -Term  Budget Framework (MTBF) and issued strategic \\nguidance through Budget Call Circular (BCC) to the line ministries to make their budget climate inclusive. \\nAs part of MTBF process, it has also devel oped a climate inclusive macro -economic framework. In \\naddition, over the last four years, the Finance Division has been publishing annual climate budget report \\nusing its robust IT platform called iBAS++. As part of the process of ensuring enhanced accounta bility and \\ntranspar ency, the Office of the Auditor General has introduced climate performance audit in its audit \\nprotocol. These initiatives are linked with ADP implementation and help monitor climate expenditure of \\nBangladesh.  \\nControlling Noise Pollution : Noise pollution is one of the major environmental issues in all the big cities \\nin Bangladesh. High noise has serious health impact including hearing impairment, increase in blood \\npressure and heartbeat, obstacle in digestive system and above all, decreas e in growth of the children \\nindiscriminate and impatient honking of the drivers is one of the major reasons for noise pollution. The \\nGovernment has promulgated noise (Control) Rules, 2006. To expedite implementation of the Noise \\n(Control) Rules, 2006, the Government has implemented a program titled Integrated and Participatory \\nProgram to Control Noise pollution during 2015 -2017. The program included airing a discussion program \\non television and publicity campaign through Public Media and Social Media. DoE h as taken a project \\nnamed ‘Noise Pollution Control through collaborative and participatory approach’ to address noise \\npollution problem in the country.  \\nMonitoring and Reducing Air Pollution: The Department of Environment under the Ministry of \\nEnvironment, F orest and Climate Change has been consistently monitoring the ambient air quality of the \\ncountry through its 16 (sixteen) Continuous Air Monitoring Stations (CAMS)  and 15 (fifteen) Compact \\nCAMS installed across the country. 05 (five) criteria air pollutant s are continuously monitored by these \\nstations. Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) values are also calculated based on the available air quality data \\nthat refers to the situation of air pollution in terms of health impacts, and this daily AQI is presented at Do E \\nwebsite. To address the air pollution effectively, the Government of Bangladesh has taken necessary \\nmeasures in terms of policy, legal and administrative instruments.  The Government of Bangladesh has \\nenacted Brick Manufacturing and Kiln Installation Act,  2013 (Amended 2019). To make mandatory use of \\nblock bricks, government has issued a gazette notification in November 2019. The gazette notification has \\nphased the targets of reduction of use of clay -fired bricks over the period of 2019 to 2025, except for  the \\nconstruction of base/sub -base of the high -ways. The Department of Environment in collaboration with local \\nadministrations started rigorous enforcement drives to dismantle or shut down polluting brick kilns across   \\n \\n481 \\n the country particularly in the distri cts adjacent to Dhaka city. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and \\nClimate Change issued a comprehensive guidelines or directives to relevant government and non -\\ngovernment entities with a view to controlling and reducing air pollution from their respectiv e activities \\nparticularly pollution from brick kilns, construction activities, vehicles, open biomass burning, industry and \\nothers.  In order to address air pollution issues comprehensively, a separate Act ‘Clean Air Act, 2020’ has \\nbeen formulated.  \\nImpleme ntation of Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs)  \\nBangladesh acceded to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer on 2nd August \\n1990 and approved its London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing amendments in 1994, 2000, 2001 and \\n2010 respectively. Bangladesh also ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on 08 June \\n2020 through which high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant HFCs have to be phased down. As \\nper global commitments, Bangladesh achieved 100 % phase -out of import and consumption of CFCs, \\nHalons, Methyl Chloroform and Carbon Tetrachloride by 1 January 2010. As per another schedule, \\nBangladesh met 10% HCFC reduction target by 2015, 33% reduction target by 2018 and committed to meet \\nthe target of  67.5% reduction by 2025. In line with the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol, Bangladesh has \\nstarted phasing down activities for the refrigerant HFCs having high GWP. It has been assessed that because \\nof global phase down HFCs by 2050, global temperature ri se could be reduced by 0.5°C. UN Environment \\n(UNEP), International Ozone Secretariat and World Customs Organization jointly awarded Bangladesh \\nwith the certificate of appreciation in 2012, 2017 and 2019 for the outstanding success on implementation \\nof the Montreal Protocol.  \\nMeasures to Protect Natural Recourses : Rice has been being distributed through VGF to more than \\n400,000 families who were dependent on fishing every year during the ban on catching mother Hilsas. \\nMoreover, such support was also extended to more than 250,000 families dependent on fishing for four \\nmonths every year during the ban on catching Jhatka -Hilsas. Measures were also taken to preserve aquatic \\nforests and swamps, ecologically critical areas, etc. The Government has prepared a Nationa l Conservation \\nPolicy 2016 -2031 which aims to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Government continues ban \\non timber felling from natural forests till December 2022. At the same time SMART patrolling has started \\nin the Sundarbans and other pro tected areas to conserve the wildlife and biodiversity.  \\nClimate Change Trust Fund: The Government of Bangladesh adopted the Bangladesh Climate Change \\nStrategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) to address the perils of climate change in 2009. Moreover, to \\nimplement the BCCSAP, the Government established the Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) from its own \\nresources – making Bangladesh the first LDC to institutionalize a home -grown  approach to address climate \\nchange.  To finance BCCTF , the government allocated 3,652 crore Taka so far. During the period of the \\nSeventh Five Year Plan, the BCCTF has funded 78 projects for addressing climate change impacts.  \\nDevelopment of a Pro -Poor Climate Change Management Strategy: A pro -poor Climate Change \\nManagement strategy has been imp lemented emphasizing on adaptation, resilience building, disaster risk \\nreduction, low carbon development, green technology and R&D.  \\nMainstre aming Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management  Agenda into National Planning:  The \\nGovernment has been active in e stablishing various polic ies and institutional initiatives to integrate disaster \\nand climate change into its national planning. In particular, the GoB is committed to promoting a whole of   \\n \\n482 \\n government approach to address climate change related risks. Climate  change has been highlighted in its \\nown chapter since the Sixth Five Year Plan. Local Government Division also mainstreamed climate change \\ninto 72 most climate vulnerable  Union Parishad’s planning process and supported 300,000 people to build \\ntheir adaptiv e capacity against salinity, cyclone, flash flood and floods in coastal, haor and Charlands.  In \\naddition, the Standing Order on Disaster is revised to address new risks including earthquake, urban \\ndisasters following the same principle of whole of society approach. In addition, developme nt of ‘ex-ante’ \\nDisaster Impact Assessment  (DIA) , which is a tool for integrating knowledge and information on potential \\ndisasters in the process of ‘Risk -informed planning’,  is underway , pursued by Ministry of Planning.  In this \\nsupport, the Planning Commission is establishing Digital Risk Information Platform (DRIP) connecting \\nexisting initiatives for digital Bangladesh, with an aim to provide necessary disaster and climate risk data \\nand information to carry out Disaster Imp act Assessment (DIA) of development projects.  \\nExpanding Special Economic Zones Improve Land Usage: Bangladesh routinely loses agricultural land \\nfor non -agricultural use that hinders environmental management due to ad hoc industrialization in different \\nregions. This weakens sound environmental management as pollution and industrial wastes hinder \\nenvironmental setting of local communities. The introduction of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) has helped \\noffer more structure to environmental management as it concen trates industrialization in few specific \\nregions, allowing environmental regulators to monitor industrial pollution more accurately. So far, the \\nGovernment  has inaugurated eleven economic zones that are ready for setting up factories, which are the: \\nMongla  Economic Zone at Mongla in Bagerhat district, Meghna Economic Zone and Meghna Economic \\nIndustrial Economic Zone at Sonargaon in Narayanganj, Abdul Monem Economic Zone at Gazaria in \\nMunshiganj, Bay Economic  Zone at Gazipur Sadar in Gazipur, Aman Economic Z one at Sonargaon in \\nNarayanganj, City Economic Zone at Rupganj in Narayanganj, Kishoreganj Economic Zone at Pakundia in \\nKishoreganj, East West Special Economic Zone at Keraniganj in Dhaka, Karnaphuli Dry Dock Special \\nEconomic Zone at Anwara in Chittagong, and Sreehatta Economic Zone at Moulvibazar Sadar in \\nMoulvibazar. In total, the Government plans to administer 51 state -owned special economic zones and \\neleven privately owned economic zones.    \\nBangladesh Bank’s Expanding Support for Green Technology: In 20 09, Bangladesh Bank  established  \\nthe refinance scheme for supporting environment friendly technology such as solar energy, bio -gas plants, \\nand Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP). The initial schemes focused on only 10 products, which have  \\nincreased to 50 produ cts fewer than  11 categories: renewable energy, energy efficiency, solid waste \\nmanagement, liquid waste management, alternative energy, fire burnt brick, non -fire block brick, recycling \\nand recyclable product, ensuring safety in work environment of factori es, etc. Moreover, as of now, 39 \\nbanks and 19 financial institutions have signed a participation agreement with Bangladesh Bank to avail \\nfinance from this scheme.  \\nRelocation of Tannery: Production of leather and leather goods  is a booming sector in Bangla desh. \\nHowever, it comes at a heavy cost due to its impacts on the environment. Thus, to mitigate its impacts, the \\nleather industry was relocated to Savar from Hazaribagh during the 7th Plan period , building a Tannery \\nEstate in the progress.   \\nCountry Progra mme Framework for Green Climate Fund (Accessing international finance for \\nclimate action):  ERD as Bangladesh National Designated Authority to Green Climate Fund (GCF) \\ndeveloped a 4b USD pipeline for GCF and mobilised almost 94.7 million with 4 projects fro m GCF.    \\n \\n483 \\n 8.3 KEY CHALLENGES TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT   \\n8.3.1  Lack of Coherent Institutions, Policies and Resource Constraints  \\nThe Government of Bangladesh has introduced a wide array of institutions and policies to address the \\nenvironmental challenges facin g Bangladesh. Yet, it does recognize that often the laws, regulations and \\nprogrammes did not emerge as a part of a coordinated and integrated sustainable development strategy; as \\nit is not so clear how these laws and regulations interact with each other an d how they connect to the \\noverarching goal of reconciling economic progress and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the \\ngovernment recognizes the limitations within the overall governance and institutional arrangement that \\nguides environmental manageme nt. In particular, the focal ministry for environmental management, the \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change ( MoEFCC ), and its main agency for environmental \\nmanagement, the Department of Environment (DoE), have inadequate capacities, technic al knowledge and \\nstaffing due to very limited resources. The technical data on environment performance is also scarce and \\nnot regularly monitored or updated to check the progress. Likewise, there are inadequate staffing and \\nlogistics for forest management and limited technical skill to address the national and international reporting \\nrequirements at Forest Department. Inadequate coordination between the MoEFCC  and the other key \\nministries have also undermined the state of environment management; perhaps bes t reflected in the \\nabsence of Local Government Institutions (LGIs) in environmental management.  \\nThe government recognizes these limitations and aims to improve such limitations by implementing the \\nbroader strategic objectives and targets of the Bangladesh  Delta Plan 2100, which undertakes a holistic \\napproach to reconcile long -term economic progress with the environmental concerns associated with both \\nclimate change and industrialization. The government is also committed to initiate Environmental Fiscal \\nReforms (EFR), which can reduce the pricing distortions presently undermining sound environmental \\nmanagement. Currently, fiscal policy does  an adequate job to achieve environmental sustainability. \\nHowever, an assessment needs  to be done on fiscal incentives a nd necessary adjustments can be brought to \\nincentivise green growth. In contrast, the pricing policies of energy heavily subsidize carbon -emitting fossil \\nfuels that have not only created tremendous budgetary burdens, but also contributed to air and water \\npollution resulting significant amount of health expenditure with implications GOB’s vision. These issues \\nwill be addressed under the 8FYP  through implementation of effective environmental fiscal reforms that \\nare based on a mix of both “polluter pays” and “ beneficiary pays” principles reinforced by sustainable \\nconsumption  and production.  However, all these reforms must end up in financing environmental \\nmanagement sufficiently. There is little debate that at the heart of the weak performance of environmental  \\nprotection is the shortage of financial resources. Direct spending by the coordinating ministry responsible \\nfor managing the national environmental programmes (MoEFCC) has been almost negligible and even as \\nlate as FY2020;  the targeted budget was only abo ut 0.05% of GDP .  Total public spending of the core \\nministries dealing with water, land and environment -related services constitute about 0.39% of GDP.  This \\nresource scarcity severely limits the scope of institutions within the government to support a com prehensive \\nset of activities for sound environmental management and execute climate change adaptation programmes.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n484 \\n Table 8. 3: Public Spending by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Taka Crore)  \\nMinistry  FY2000  FY2010  FY2020  \\nOperating  ADP  Total  Operating  ADP  Total  Operating  ADP  Total  \\nMoEFCC  52 80 132 769 62 831 820 676 1496  \\nNom.

Moreover, the population is expected to grow \\nto 200 million people by 2050, which will have substantial implications for environmental change. \\nUrbanization and industrialization that accompanied this growth in population caused serious strain  on \\nenvironmental quality and natural resources, including air, water, and soil pollution. This has threatened \\necosystems and public health as well as economic growth. The leading environmental challenges that \\nBangladesh face due to such changes in its pop ulation and economic activities are as follows:   \\nWater Quality: DoE is conducting monitoring and enforcement drive with its limited capacity and that is \\nnot sufficient to cover all the polluting industries and organizations responsible for water pollution . Water \\npollution in Bangladesh mostly results from industrial discharges, municipal wastes, agrochemicals, salinity \\nintrusion and arsenic contamination. Consequently, this has severely undermined the quality of the rivers \\nover the years and it remains an enduring problem. In particular, the major causes of surface water pollution \\nare related to land -based activities, including industrial effluents, agrochemicals, and faecal  pollution, and \\noil and lube spillages. Given rivers are frequently used as dumps, o verall inland surface water quality drops \\nbelow the permissible limit of Department of Environment (DoE) standards in the dry season although it \\nimproves in the wet/monsoon season. It is also essential to recognize that process of industrialization has \\nbeen mostly concentrated in few districts, which are: Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Chattogram , \\nCumilla and Khulna.  And that is why, Buriganga and Turag River, which are the two major rivers of Dhaka, \\nhave been most susceptible to water pollution fr om industries relating tannery, fabric dying and chemical \\nprocessing, fabric washing, garments, plastic products etc. located on the banks of these two rivers. In many \\nplaces, the sewerage lines carrying sewage and municipal solid waste also end up in thes e rivers. According \\nto different surveys, 60 out of 64 districts – comprising 126,134 km2 of Bangladesh are exposed to arsenic \\ncontamination in their drinking water. On the whole, this calls for a paradigm shift in how water is managed \\nin Bangladesh and th us, attaining significant improvements during the 8 FYP period will be essential for \\nmeeting the broader environmental objectives.  Limited capacity of the Department of Environment (DoE) \\nas a monitoring and enforcing body along with lack of resources allowe d the industries, sewerage and solid \\nwaste management authorities to dump their wastes to the receiving water.  \\nUnsustainable use of ground water for industrial and other commercial purposes is also threatening the \\nwater security of the country. Currently groundwater is free for any use. 8th five-year plan will focus on \\nthe valuation (water pricing and water auditing) of the water to limit its unsustainable use.  \\nBecause of increasing industrialization along the coast and limited capacity in the management of plastic \\nwastes marine water pollution is increasing.    \\n \\n485 \\n Urban Air Pollution: Existing evidence indicates that the urban air environment in major cities of \\nBangladesh is amongst the most polluted in the world. The air quality monitored by the World Health \\nOrganization (WHO) ranks Bangladesh as having one of the most polluted air out of 202 countries. This is \\na less than desired scenario as the availability of clean air is an essential part of the quality of life, as air \\npollution can have severe negative ef fects on public health over the longer term, including chronic \\nrespiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. \\nAccording to the WHO, outdoor air pollution results in 4.2 million premature deaths aro und the world. \\nMore specifically, the distribution of all deaths are as follows: (i) 29% of all deaths and disease from lung \\ncancer; (ii) 17% of all deaths and disease from acute lower respiratory infection; (iii) 24% of all deaths \\nfrom stroke; (iv) 25% of  all deaths and disease from ischaemic heart disease; and (v) 43% of all deaths and \\ndisease from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several factors contribute to outdoor air pollution in \\nBangladesh.  These mainly include: the use of fossil fuel for ene rgy; emissions from industrial plants, \\nespecially brick kilns; emissions from transport vehicles without adequate emission control mechanisms, \\nand gaseous releases from the improper treatment and disposal of solid and liquid wastes. And that is why \\nthe 8FYP remains committed to reducing urban air pollution, so that Bangladesh can avoid the broader \\npublic health risks that are associated with urban air pollution.  \\nImpact of Industry in Metropolitan City and in Residential Building/Area: Industrial sector is u sually \\naccepted as the engine that triggers economic growth due to its strong backward and forward linkages with \\nother sectors. On the other hand, Industry in Metropolitan City and as well as in Residential Building’s  \\nactivity could end up with negative ec onomic, social and environmental impacts. Metropolitan cities of \\nBangladesh have been facing this problem severely. The Government of Bangladesh is establishing \\nEconomic Zone, now time to shift all industries from residential area/building as well as from metropolitan.   \\nLand Degradation: Bangladesh remains the most densely populated countries in the world if we consider \\nall the countries or territories with populations of more than 5 million.  Land degradation  is a special \\nchallenge for Bangladesh  owing to t he low per capita availability of land that has been gradually shrinking \\nowing to the population growth.  It is also essential to recognize that degradation of the available land adds \\nto the challenge of achieving and sustaining food security for a country . Soil degradation can happen either \\nfrom natural processes or due to the pattern of land use. The natural factors that lower the productivity of \\nsoil include water logging ; salinity encroachment; soil erosion  and landslides. Processes of land use that \\ndegrade the soil include cropping  pattern; infrastructure construction; industrialization; and solid waste \\ndisposal. The major  types  of land degradation  that Bangladesh  faces  are (i) soil erosion,  (ii) water  pollution,  \\n(iii) river bank  erosion,  (iv) coastal  salinization,  (v) sedimentation,  (vi) acid sulphate  soil, (vii) acidification,  \\n(viii)  water  logging  (ix) depletion  of soil fertility , x) soil pollution,  xi) plough plan and xii) deforestation . \\nAs a result,  the 8FYP  will undertake  a range  of activities  that will help mitigate  the problem  of land \\ndegradation  in Bangladesh  and will help support  the broader  agenda  of attaining  sustainable  development.      \\nLoss of Bio -Diversity: Biodiversity constitutes the living natural resources that are found inhabiting our \\naquatic (including marine and fresh water) and terrestrial (including all the major biomes like forests) \\necological systems. Moreover, sustaining biodiversity is essential as it provides people with basic \\necosystem goods and services that include food, fibr e, medicine, water and air purification, climate control, \\ncycling of nutrient and control of erosion. Thus, loss in biodiversity has implications  for the wider \\npopulation, especially those who depend on agriculture, fisheries and forestry for their livelih oods. \\nProtecting biodiversity is particularly essential for Bangladesh because agriculture accounts for 40% of the   \\n \\n486 \\n employment of its labour force. Biodiversity also has implications for public health as loss of biodiversity \\nhas serious implication for the availability of medicines;  given approximately half of all synthetic drugs \\nhave a natural origin.  Bangladesh, in this context, has had a rich heritage of a diverse ecosystem, which \\nhas come under severe threat from environmentally damaging economic transf ormation. Deforestation and \\nforest degradation , the degradation of land, sea and river water pollution, indiscriminate filling of water \\nbodies for land acquisition, unsustainable use of ground water and fishery resources in ponds, lakes and \\nrivers, and uns ustainable ways of shrimp farming have collectively taken a huge toll on the degradation of \\nthe eco -system and consequent loss of biodiversity.  \\nNoise Pollution:  Noise pollution remains a severe health risk, especially in the urban areas and of course, \\na city like Dhaka which has one of the highest population densities in the world. Lack of public awareness, \\nmotivation as well as  weak enforcement of the noise -related rules and regulations has led to noise levels \\nexceeding the acceptable limit major cities. S ources of this pollution include road, rail, and air traffic, as \\nwell as industry, construction, and hydraulic horns; and frequent exposure to high levels of noise increases \\npublic health concerns as it damages hearing, and increases stress and blood press ure among other health \\nimpacts.  \\nMunicipal Waste Pollution: Effective solid waste management remains a severe challenge in Bangladesh , \\nwhich undermines the health and well -being of its urban residents. Municipal solid waste management \\nefforts in Bangladesh  often focus on the collection and disposal of solid waste while cost -effective \\nopportunities involving waste reduction programmes and recycling strategies remain mostly unexplored. \\nMoreover, only between 44 and 76 per cent  of the total municipal solid was te is collected, leaving huge \\namounts uncollected  and untreated. This creates a public nuisance as well as a health hazard. More \\nspecially, ineffective waste management leads to various communicable diseases. For instance, it has been \\nestimated that 20 per cent of biomedical waste is highly infectious and often ends up in sewage systems. \\nReports have also indicated that most cases of child mortality can be linked to this poor sanitation problem.  \\nE-Waste:  Technology is becoming increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives. Semiconductors \\nand sensors are being added to products that never before had them, creating wearable monitors, smart \\nhomes, TVs that can stream programming from the internet, and much more.  Meanwhile, the life span of \\ndevices is getting shorter as many products will be redundant once their batteries die or are replaced as \\nupgraded versions enter the market. In fact, to some degree, companies intentionally plan the obsolescence \\nof their goods by updating the design or software and discontinuing support for older models, so that it is \\ncheaper to buy a new product than to repair an old one. Electronic devices are made of a complex mix of \\nmaterials that include gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium, lithium, cobalt and other valuab le elements. \\nThese precious materials can be reclaimed through  recycling . But electronic devices also \\ncomprise  toxic  heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and be ryllium, polluting PVC plastic and \\nhazardous chemicals, such as brominated flame retardants, which can harm human health and the \\nenvironment.  \\nMedical Waste:  The risin g density of infectious and hazardous medical waste is posing serious threats to \\nenvironmental health and requires special attention with specific treatment and management prior to its \\nfinal disposal. The problem is growing with an ever -increasing number o f hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic \\nlaboratories in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Due to a dearth of contemporary research, very little is known on \\nthe magnitude of the problem. A report reveals that health care establishments (HCE) in Dhaka generate   \\n \\n487 \\n around 56 tons/day of wastes having both hazardous and non -hazardous. Out of which, around 12 tons/day \\nof hazardous waste are generated. Apart from Dhaka and few cities, there is no proper and systematic in -\\nhouse and out -house medical waste management in the country . Even the existing systems in Dhaka and \\nfew cities are not comparable with the systems operated in advanced countries.  \\nWithin Bangladesh, climate change remains one of the most critical threats to its social and economic \\nprogress. It challenges the countr y’s aim to sustain food security and makes its population vulnerable to \\nboth environmental and health shocks. The rise of sea levels (SLR) and the displacement of a large segment \\nof the population associated with it can create both climate induced exodus, resulting in higher poverty plus \\nlower quality of urban life, and a depletion of valuable assets.  Moreover, these climates  related economic \\nvulnerabilities and risks are created through multiple channels, which are:   \\nImpacts on Agriculture: Agriculture r emains of the most vulnerable sectors to the effects of climate \\nchange. The key channels through which climate change damages the productivity of the agriculture sector \\nare: (i) rising temperatures and solar radiation increase the incidence of insects , dis eases and \\nmicroorganisms hurting soil fertility; {ii} rising temperatures can reduce the yields of different types of \\nrice; (iii) rise in salinity due to sea level rises undermine soil fertility, hurting farm productivity. In fact, a \\nstudy conducted in Khu lna, Bagerhat, and Shatkhira projects that a sea level rise of 32 cm could reduce the \\nsuitable area for Aman rice cultivation by 60 percent, compared to only 12 percent with a sea level rise of \\n88 cm. 6 million people are already exposed to high salinity, and climate change is expected to increase it \\nto 13.6 million people by 2050; (iv) increased flooding, land erosion and cyclones resulting from climate \\nchange will hinder agricultural output.    \\nImpacts on Forest Resources & Ecosystems:  Climate Change indu ced - rise in sea levels, temperature \\nand increased incidence of storms and flooding induced by climate change will bring damage to forest \\nresources and harm climate species sensitive to the climate. The world’s largest mangrove forest, the \\nSundarbans, is extremely vulnerable to climate change as rise in sea level will increase saltwater intrusion, \\nwhich will deteriorate the health of the overall eco -system of the forest. Forest cover is already threatened \\nby cyclones and human interference as a segment of t he poor people depend s on forest resources for their \\nlivelihood. Degradation of wetlands owing to human interference has caused several problems, including \\nextinction and reduction of wildlife, extinction of many indigenous wild and domesticated rice varie ties, \\nloss of many indigenous aquatic plants, herbs, shrubs and weeds, loss of natural soil nutrients, loss of natural \\nwater reservoirs and of their resultant benefits, increase in the occurrence of flooding and degeneration of \\nwetland based ecosystems, oc cupations, socio -economic institutions, and cultures. Land degradation from \\nsalinity and water -logging creates problems for agricultural sustainability. In general, sustainable uses of \\nland, water and forest will become increasingly difficult as the effect s of climate change unfolds over the \\nnext few decades.    \\nImpact on Land and Physical Assets:  Empirical data from  15 monitoring stations during 1980 to 2012 \\nindicate that rises in the sea level have increased in the coastal zones by 6 to 21 mm per year. M oreover, \\nthe Government recognizes that country can expect to experience sea level rises of 14 cm, 32 cm, and 88 \\ncm by the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. This will result in both losses  of public and private \\nland and physical assets, as well as increased health risks due to increased salinity. In fact, a 1 -meter rise in \\nsea levels will submerge a large part of the dry land permanently. This will result in a fall in production  in \\nall sectors and a land quantity shock which will adversely affect th e overall real GDP. Climate change and \\nthe resultant floods and cyclones will also impact the capital stock negatively as it will accelerate   \\n \\n488 \\n depreciation of physical infrastructures. In fact, the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report underscored that the \\nrise in sea levels can put at least 27 million people in Bangladesh at risk – leading to climate induced \\nmigration.  \\nImpact on Environment and Health : Climate change is also expected to increase health hazards as it \\nmight facilitate water -borne diseases, such as d iarrhoea and dysentery, and vector -borne diseases, such as \\nmalaria and dengue (which are climate sensitive). Research suggests that growing morbidity could occur \\nfrom dengue and malaria. Additional health risks emerge from exposure to contaminated water, e specially \\narsenic poisoning. In urban areas poor waste management and polluted water bodies create serious \\nenvironment -related health concerns. Furthermore, increased concentration of humidity in the environment \\ncan also trigger respiratory problems.  \\nWate r and Sanitation Services to the Hard-to-reach Climate Hotspots:  Hard -to-reach climate hotspots \\nsuch as chars, haors, hilly areas, and coastal regions suffer from considerably low water, sanitation and \\nhygiene  (WASH) service levels. The problems are partic ularly pronounced for coastal regions. According  \\nto the National Strategy for Water and Sanitation in Hard to Reach Areas 2011, coastal regions account for \\nthe second highest number of hard -to-reach unions in the extreme category, only behind hilly areas. Coastal \\nareas are vulnerable to adverse climate impacts of sea level rise and salinity intrusion. A rise in groundwater \\nsalinity has a disproportionate impact on the poor. The World Bank’s Bangladesh WASH Poverty \\nDiagnostic (BWPD) study suggests that about  2.5 million in the southwest coastal region are already \\nsuffering from shortages in drinking water, and by 2050, water scarcity can impact as many as 5.2 million \\npoor and 3.2 million extreme poor in the region. To avoid saline groundwater, the poor are mo re likely to \\nturn to using water from unprotected freshwater sources such as ponds, risking serious health consequences. \\nStudies have also shown that a rise in salinity in the Sundarbans region is associated with lower school \\nattendance of schoolgirls as t hey are often burdened with fetching water from distant locations9.  \\nIn addition to Delta Plan 2100, the National Strategy for Water and Sanitation in Hard to Reach Areas 2011 \\nalso acknowledges the WASH crisis in hill tracts, coastal zones, haors and other  hard-to-reach areas. It \\nshould be noted that this strategy also articulates a plan for urban slums as most slums are located on \\nlowlands and are vulnerable to waterlogging and natural disasters. The challenges faced by these areas are \\ndiverse. Coastal zon es are susceptible to salinity intrusion, freshwater scarcity, and groundwater level \\ndecline. Freshwater scarcity and drinking water supply are also major issues in hill tracts, along with \\ninadequate sanitation services. The areas susceptible to climate ch ange require context specific \\ninterventions to ensure sustainable WASH services. Adequate attention should also be given to climate -\\ninduced WASH realities of women and other vulnerable groups who are disproportionately affected.  \\n8.4 ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES A ND ACTIVITIES UNDER THE 8th PLAN  \\nSustainable development targets and strategies relating to environment, climate change and forest \\nmanagement in the 8FYP will essentially draw on the long -term goals and strategies articulated in the \\nPP2041.

Base year values show most recent available data  \\n8.4.1  Adoption of Environmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR) for Sustainable Development   \\nThe Government will undertake a wide array of environmental fiscal refo rms for improving environmental \\nperformance to attain sustainable development and green growth. These will include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrating Environment and Ecosystem Conservation and Climate Change Issues in \\nPlanning and Budgeting : The Government will prioritize the integration of environmental \\nconservation  in budgetary management by increasingly undertaking green Public Financial \\nManagement (PFM), which will depend on green accounting, procurement and auditing. Project \\nselection will require full accounting of enviro nmental costs for all investment projects. The \\nincorporation of the “Green PFM” agenda will happen under the 8FYP  and institutional capacities \\nin the Ministries of Finance, Planning and concerned line ministries will be improved and \\nstrengthened to achieve  this objective.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing Resources for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change:  The \\nGovernment acknowledges that for the MoEFCC  to play its due role in environmental management, \\nit must invest in its capacities and allow it to use more re sources. The government will progressively \\nincrease in its budget to reach the target of 0.1% of GDP by 2025 and 0.5% of GDP by 2041, so \\nthat it can improve capacity through better staffing, including technical professional staff, \\nestablishing a strong dig ital Management Information System (MIS) based on a data bank that gets \\nregularly updated, and regular monitoring and evaluation of environmental compliance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increased resources in the management of ecosystem and biodiversity conservation: As per \\nthe ECA r ules 2016, The Government of Bangladesh is going to develop a special fund for \\nmanagement and improvement of Ecologically Critical Areas and create financial code of revenue \\nbudget to improve the ECAs following ecosystem based approach. The Government of B angladesh \\nhas declared 13 areas as ECAs and imposed different restrictions to restrict the deterioration of the   \\n \\n490 \\n ecosystem and biodiversity. The Government of Bangladesh is the party to the Convention of \\nBiological Diversity (CBD). To implement the Conventi on and its objectives, the Government of \\nBangladesh has developed the NBSAP 2016 -2021, as CBD will enter into a new decade (2021 -\\n2030). During the beginning of the 8FYP , Bangladesh has to revise the NBSAP in line with the \\nglobal targets under Global Biodiv ersity Framework. As per Bangladesh Biological Diversity Act, \\n2017 The Government of Bangladesh is going to establish Biodiversity Fund to support activities \\nof conservation and sustainable use at the grass root and community level.   \\n\\uf0b7 Taxation of Emission f rom Industrial Units:  The Government has already introduced policies \\nfor the control of air pollution from brick manufacturing kilns. Moreover, under the 8FYP , it will \\ndevelop more policies to control emission from the other polluting industries by develop ing a \\n“polluter pays principle with appropriate compensation”.  In order to do so, the Government will \\nundertake measures to better monitor air quality standards of industrial units better – as the absence \\nof proper testing equipment and database has so fa r undermined such effort. Thus, the creation of \\nan appropriate mechanism to store data and monitoring will allow the Government to introduce a \\nsystem of taxes on air pollution, which will create incentives for the industrialists to adopt clean \\ntechnology.  \\n\\uf0b7 Taxation of Industrial Water Pollution: The Government will increasingly monitor and impose \\ntaxes and fines for the pollution of water by the industrial units. This will improve the incentive \\nstructure as private entrepreneurs will be incentivized to inves t in ETPs, so that a better \\nmanagement of pollution is attained under the 8FYP . At present, disposal of untreated effluent by \\nthe industrial units is causing major deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water.  \\n\\uf0b7 Biosafety:   The Government of Bang ladesh has developed Biosafety Policy and Biosafety \\nguidelines. Under Bangladesh Biosafety Rules 2012, the risk of genetically modified organism \\n(GMO) has to be controlled to ensure safe transfer and handling of GMOs, taking into risk to human \\nhealth. Inst itutions/Organizations dealing with GMOs should implement the Biosafety measures \\nfollowing the Biosafety rules and guidelines. DoE has completed a development project on \\nImplementation of NBF and further enhancement of capacity building is envisaged during  8FYP.   \\n\\uf0b7 Reducing Subsidies for Fuel and Adopt Green Tax on Fossil Fuel Consumption:   The \\nGovernment will increasingly reduce its subsidies on fossil fuels to support its policies and goals \\non climate change . The Government will also introduce a green tax o n the consumption of fossil \\nfuels as it discourages the emission of CO 2 from fossil fuels but also provides a useful avenue for \\ngeneration of revenue that will be used for supporting clean energy and other environmental \\nprogrammes .   \\n\\uf0b7 Pricing Policies for W ater, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management:  The Government \\nrecognizes that the state alone cannot be the sole provider of water, sanitation and waste \\nmanagement services. Consequently, under the 8FYP, the Government will develop appropriate \\npricing polic ies to encourage private piped water supply, hygienic and environmentally safe \\nhousehold sanitation and sound management of solid waste. The public sector alone cannot handle \\nthe large service gaps and private provision might be needed. The Beneficiary Pay s Principle will \\nbe used to develop the criteria for setting prices – especially for the urban middle class who now \\nhas the income to bear such costs.    \\n \\n491 \\n \\uf0b7 Introduction of Household Illegal Waste Dumping Charges:  The Government acknowledges \\nthat a major source  of air and water pollution is the dumping of household wastes in water bodies \\nand in neighbourhoods. With improved solid waste management services from the municipalities \\nand private sector as discussed above, this endemic problem can be reduced. As a res ult, under the \\n8FYP, a system of pollution charges for the illegal disposal of household waste will be introduced \\nwhich will improve household cooperation and compliance. The Government will initially \\nundertake a pilot scheme in the high -income urban neigh bourhoods where the installation of \\nsecurity cameras could assist compliance with such regulations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exploring Private Financing Options:  There are three main instruments for boosting private \\nfinancing for the environment. First, in several areas, such as afforestation outside dedicated  forests \\nfor timber and non -timber forest products , fisheries, eco -tourism, water supply and waste \\nmanagement, private supply will be encouraged with proper regulatory and pricing policies. \\nSecond, legal and regulatory policie s will be used to encourage proper adoption of measures that \\ninclude private investment in the protection of the environment.  Important examples of this include \\nadoption of clean air technology in the industries, installation of ETPs in industries and pri vate \\nhospitals, and prevention of land degradation through proper farming practices – including the \\nbanning of Jhum cultivation while providing alternative livelihoods to the affected population. \\nThird, the public sector will enter into co -financing arrang ements for a range of environmental \\nservices through Public -Private Partnerships – including partnerships with communities.   \\n\\uf0b7 Taxation on Timber Extraction:  The Government of  Bangladesh recognizes the challenges \\nwhich it faces in forest management, includ ing serious administrative and governance issues. As a \\nfirst step, it will prioritize improvements in forest governance through a proper Management \\nInformation System (MIS). This will assist the formulation of a tax framework for on the extraction \\nof timbe r by taxing excessive usages of timber by the wood furniture industry. This can become an \\nimportant source of revenue for the Government over time and also support more sustainable timber \\nextraction. The tax will be levied at the factory gate where logs en ter for further processing so that \\nall logging  are captured in the tax net.  \\n8.4.2  Administrative Reforms for Implementing Environmental Fiscal Reforms  \\n\\uf0b7 Coordinating NAP, BCCSAP, CIP and NDC with BDP 2100: Mainstreaming environment and \\nclimate change into p lanning process involves improved governance and coordination and linkage \\namong various plan documents. BDP 2100 would offer host umbrella plan for such relevant plans. \\nGED in close partnership with MoEFCC, sectoral ministries and ERD as NDA will guide thi s plan \\nharmonization. Governance structure that has been taking place for BDP 2100 might be used to \\nguide and monitor these plans and programmes to ensure better coordination and mobilize \\nnecessary budget. MoEFCC and DoE in particular will take appropriate  actions in this regard and \\nconsult GED as and when necessary.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mainstreaming EFR within Ministry of Finance (MoF):  The Government of Bangladesh \\nrecognizes that the adoption of Environmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR) will require policy focus from \\nthe Ministry o f Finance (MoF).  This will necessitate that the MoF develops effective partnerships \\nwith several local research institutions that can support with EFR policy formulation – and under \\nthe 8FYP  – the Government will pursue such partnerships to mainstream EFR  within the MoF.     \\n \\n492 \\n \\uf0b7 Improving the Capacity of MoEFCC:   During  the 8FYP , the Government will address the weak \\ntechnical capacity of the MoEFCC to expedite  the implementation of EFR. Accordingly, the \\nGovernment will ensure that the Forest Department and the D epartment of Environment (DoE) are \\nadequately staffed, so that they have the necessary technical skills to execute their respective \\nregulatory roles and also implement EFR. At present, the MoEFCC and the DoE lack technical \\nexpertise, trained staff, baselin e information, and strong Management Information Systems (MIS). \\nFurthermore , changes in M inistry ’s personnel leads to a lack of institutional memory, and incurs \\nadditional costs for designing and implementing the climate change policies. These issues will \\nreceive attention during the 8FYP  period.  Government will develop and maintain a proper MIS for \\nForest Department and DoE. This will start as a pilot program in Dhaka and then gradually extended \\nto the other large industrial cities. Third, steps will be t aken to tackle all problems related to \\ngovernance in forest management and the implementation of environmental standards and \\ncompliance.  It is also necessary to enhance  the capacity and expertise of BCCT as it operationalizes \\nCCTF and with access to inter national fund in future.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing the Role of LGIs:  During  the 8 FYP, the Government will prioritize the implementation \\nof the beneficiary pays principle by increasing the role of Local Government Institutions (LGI) in \\nenvironmental management. First, the  Government will establish WASAs in all 7 Divisional cities \\nby 2025. Second, it will introduce adequate financial accounting and reporting standards that allow \\na good estimate of the unit cost of the services provided – including capital costs.  Third, a \\ncomputerized MIS system will be developed for each urban LGI that provides basic information \\non the number of customers, amount of water produced and supplied  number of hours of water \\navailable, the age and quality of water and sanitation infrastructure, am ount of revenues collected, \\nmissing water in terms of revenues, etc. This MIS will be updated on an annual basis. Fourth, the \\ncapabilities of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives that \\nprovides oversight to LGIs will be stren gthened to provide better guidance, supervision and \\nmonitoring of LGIs. The primary agenda here is to address the absence of an efficient mechanism \\nand administrative infrastructure to support interactions between central government and local \\nstakeholders by developing specific strategies and coordination mechanisms across different local \\nlevel government departments.    \\n\\uf0b7 Develop an “Water and Sanitation Regulatory Agency” (WASRA):  During  the 8FYP, the \\nGovernment will support the establishment of the Water a nd Sanitation Regulatory Agency \\n(WASRA) that will be charged with regulating the public and private utilities engaged with supply \\nwater and sanitation services and setting prices. This will follow the participation of private actors \\nin such markets, so tha t equitable pricing policy ensures both private investment and fair pricing \\nfor such basic services.   \\n8.4.3  Other Environmental Institutional Reforms  \\n\\uf0b7 Increased Partnerships for MoEFCC:  During  the 8FYP , the Government will ensure that the \\nMoEFCC develops p artnerships with the private sector, the NGOs and the research community in \\nthe areas of monitoring compliance and knowledge management, including the gathering of data \\nand policy research.  Regular dialogue with the stakeholders including public hearings and \\nparticipatory policy development will be undertaken to improve compliance and the   \\n \\n493 \\n implementation of policies. The MoEFCC will also come up with the Environmental Outlook \\nReport on Bangladesh regularly with updated information on the state of the enviro nment and \\naction plan for achieving the milestones, to be widely disseminated with different stakeholders.  \\n\\uf0b7 Decentralization of Environmental Management:   The Government will learn from the \\ninternational examples of good practice with regard to what might b e the appropriate division of \\nresponsibilities between the national and local level environmental agencies. To facilitate \\nimplementation, a formal coordinating mechanism between the national and local government \\nenvironmental agencies will be established. The LGIs will have to be participatory in their approach \\nand adopt proper mechanisms for allowing citizens’ participation in all local issues including \\nenvironmental management. A policy initiative will be formally taken to engage local government \\nauthorit ies down to the Upazila level to involve them in the oversight of environmental \\nmanagement, linking them to development activities.  \\n8.4.4  Context -Specific Environmental and WASH Technologies/interventions  \\n\\uf0b7 Coastal Areas:  Salinity intrusion due to natural c auses as well human -induced reasons such as \\nsaline water abstraction for shrimp cultivation affect both surface and groundwater sources. WASH \\ninfrastructures are also damaged by cyclones, storm surges and inundation. Drinking water and \\nsanitation infrastru cture need to be constructed on raised platforms. For community water supply, \\nconstructing desalination plants and rainwater harvesting systems will be considered as feasible \\nsolutions.  For smaller scale use, tube wells  with appropriate treatment units fo r arsenic and iron, \\nand pond sand filters to treat water from pond surface will be used as recommended technologies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Char Areas:  In char areas, WASH facilities are regularly damaged by inundation due to rainfall \\nflood. The areas are largely inhabited by t he poor and marginalized who are deprived from basic \\nservices including WASH. As in other areas vulnerable to flooding, housing and WASH structures \\nwill be constructed on raised platforms. Appropriate technologies including rainwater harvesting \\nand communi ty level arsenic/iron removal units for groundwater will be employed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Hill tracts: Surface water sources such as springs and streams have seasonal fluctuations, and \\ndespite exposed to heavy pollution, are mostly used for drinking and other purposes. Sanit ation \\ncoverage is also low due to lack of proper facilities. To meet drinking water needs, individual or \\ncommunity rainwater harvesting systems with adequate storage will be developed to mitigate the \\nproblems.  \\n\\uf0b7 Urban slums: Urban slum dwellers are often de prived of basic facilities such as WASH services \\ndue to various reasons, including the legal status of the land and gaps in development plans. Urban \\nslums are affected by waterlogging due to their location on lowlands and wetlands. Due to the dense \\nnature of slums, community water points and sanitation blocks to be maintained by community -\\nbased organizations will be employed as appropriate solutions. Construction of these facilities and \\ntheir effective operations will ensure proper accessibility of women, c hildren, and persons with \\ndisabilities. Proper operations and maintenance, including maintaining hygienic conditions, will \\nensure that a large number of people using these shared facilities get proper access to WASH.    \\n \\n494 \\n 8.4.5 Implementation of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100  \\nThe Government is giving priorities to the execution of the Delta Plan 2100 under the 8 FYP and reduce the \\nvulnerability of the population to natural hazards and climate change by implementing the Delta plan 2100 \\n(BDP 2100). The BDP 2100 inc ludes major policies, investment programmes and institutional reforms \\nwhich if adopted and implemented properly, will address the sources of long -term climate change \\nvulnerability at source thereby reducing the adverse effects of climate change on the popu lation. To address \\nthe challenges associated with the effective implementation of the Delta Plan, the Government under the \\n8FYP  has identified some specific objectives, which are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of a “Delta Wing” within the General Economic s Division (GED) of the \\nBangladesh Planning Commission for offering technical support, guidance and coordination for \\nthe implementation of the BDP 2100.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of a “Delta Fund” and the institutional framework necessary for its usage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of the “Delta Kno wledge Hub” for hosting and offering intellectual support to the \\nimplementation of the Delta Plan by hosting, updating, collecting and sharing new data and \\ninformation that can aid the agendas of the Delta Plan.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will present the BDP 2100 to  the Development Partners to secure their \\ninvestment in projects enlisted in the Investment Programme under the DP.   \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will also develop and review new pricing policies for Water and Sewerage \\nservices.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will also form a high -powered committee to manage coordination and \\ncooperation with the upper riparian countries for the effective implementation of the BDP 2100.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will support the formation of a “Delta Coalition” to be formed by 13 countries \\nfor mutual benefit and  the transfer of knowledge through exchange of water technologies for \\nimproved production and consumption of clean water.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will also form a team with ERD to pursue the US$100 billion to LDCs for \\nachieving SDGs, particularly for climate change  adaptation.    \\nThe Government has also adopted specific targets under the Delta Plan, which will be prioritized for \\nimplementation under the 8FYP  period. This constitutes specific goals under six key areas, which are: (i) \\nEnsure safety against disasters l inked to water and climate change; (ii) Ensure water security and efficiency \\nof water usages; (iii) Ensure integrated river systems and management of estuaries; (iv) Conserve and \\npreserve wetlands and ecosystems, and promote their wise usage; (v) Develop e ffective institutions and \\nequitable governance for intra and trans -boundary management of water resources; and (vi) Achieve \\noptimal use of land and water. Moreover, concentrated efforts will be undertaken to achieve the targets as \\ndescribed in Table – 8.5.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n495 \\n Table 8. 5: Identified Indicators and Targets for 2025  \\nNo. Indicators  Sub-Indicators  Quantity  2016 -\\n2018  Target for   \\n2025  \\n(Goal 1: Ensure safety against water and climate change related disasters)  \\n1A Risk zone susceptible  \\nto natural hazards  Average  \\nflood extent  % of total area  \\nof Bangladesh  30 20 \\nExtreme flood extent  \" 50 30 \\nCyclone damage extent  \" 10 2 \\nAverage drought extent  \" 9 9 \\nExtreme Drought Extent  \" 47 20 \\nDry season  \\nsaltwater intrusion  % of total  \\ncoastal area  40 30 \\nWater l ogging extent  \" 2.5 0.25 \\nLength of  \\nbank -line erosion  % of total  \\nriver length  15 8 \\n1B Population vulnerable  \\nto natural disasters  Flood vulnerable people  Nos. in million  88 40 \\nCyclone  \\nvulnerable people  \" 8 5 \\nErosion  \\nvulnerable people  \" 1 0.5 \\nWater logging vulnerable people  \" 0.9 0.1 \\n(Goal 2: Ensure water security and efficiency of water usages)  \\n2A Dry season water availability  - % of total flow  15 30 \\n2B Dry season  \\nirrigation coverage  - million ha  6 6.5 \\n2C Irrigation water  \\nefficiency  - % of supplied water  30 40 \\n2D Urban domestic  \\nwater efficiency  - % of supplied water  67 75 \\n2E Internal Renewable  \\nWater Resources  - cumec/ person  714 1,300  \\n2F Surface water  \\nsources polluted  \\nby industrial wastes  - % of total  \\nriver areas  11 6 \\n2G Surfac e water sources polluted by \\nother wastes   % of total  \\nriver areas  10 5 \\n(Goal 3: Ensure integrated river systems and estuaries management)  \\n3A Erosion along  \\nmajor rivers  Area eroded  \\nalong Jamuna  ha/year  1,750  1,050  \\n3B Area of reclaimed lands  - Ha N/A 35,500 \\n      \\n(Goal 4: Conserve and preserve wetlands and ecosystems and promote their wise use)  \\n4 Habitat  \\nprotection  Area of perennial  \\naquatic habitat  Ha 13,200  13,200  \\nArea of seasonal  \\naquatic habitat  \" 30,880  30,880  \\nArea of marine habitat  \" 32,300 32,300  \\n(Goal 5: Develop effective institutions and equitable governance  \\nfor intra and trans -boundary water resources management)  \\n5A Rural people with adequate capacity \\nfor WRM  - % of rural population  20 40 \\n5B Equitable share  \\nof water among users  - Qualitative judgment  Poor Moderate  \\n(Goal 6: Achieve optimal use of land and water)  \\n6A Flood control, drainage  \\nand irrigation capacity  Area under  \\nirrigation schemes  Ha 672 900 \\n6B Sectoral use  \\nof water  Surface water  \\nused for irrigation  km3 6.62 15 \\nGroundwater  \\nused for irrigation  \" 24.88  22 \\n6C Navigation  \\ncapacity  Wet season  \\nnavigation course  km 5,968  5,968  \\nDry season  \\nnavigation course  \" 3,865  5,500  \\nSource: Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100    \\n \\n496 \\n 8.4.6  Specific Activities to Improve Green Growth  \\nThe Seve nth Plan made a specific commitment to promote green growth through a wide array of activities. \\nSome of them however, have remained unaddressed, which demands key attention under the 8FYP .  As a \\nresult, the following activities are going to be prioritized under the 8FYP : \\nPromote Green Accounting  and Green Budgeting : The Government will undertake initiatives to \\nimprove the state of green accounting at the both macro and micro levels. At present, such endeavours at \\nthe macro level are hindered by the lack of essential data. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) \\nacknowledges this “data gap” and is committed improve the statistics on environmental performance in its \\nNational Accounts. Moreover, the Government will aid all endeavours to harness more accurate data on the \\nenvironmental costs of economic activities. In particular, specific focus will be given to:  \\n\\uf0b7 Emission Accounting: The Government is committed to develop a comprehensive data on the \\nemissions from all major sources of economic activities. This  is particularly important for enforcing \\nthe “polluter pays” principle, while initiating Environmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR).   \\n\\uf0b7 Natural Resource Accounts:  The BBS will generate physical statistics about the stock of natural \\nresources and their changes over ti me. This also entails calculating the monetary costs of losing \\nnatural resources.  \\n\\uf0b7 Computation of Green GDP : After developing the necessary environmental statistics by \\nundertaking emission accounting and estimating the costs of depleting natural resources,  the \\nGovernment will compute Green GDP by factoring in the environmental consequences of growth \\n– after accounting for the depletion of resources, degradation of the environment and restorative \\nenvironmental initiatives.  \\n\\uf0b7 Green Budgeting : Government shall e ndeavour to greening the overall budget and integrate \\nenvironmental considerations including budgetary provisions for offsetting or minimizing the \\nadverse impacts of development interventions in all development sectors. Government will \\nconsider Tax Exempti ons for Green Investment, Tax Exemption on Income from Green Investment \\nand Imposition of Green Tax on the product of green investment, Tax exemption for the amount \\ninvested on Biodiversity and Ecosystem conservation activities. To prevent environmental \\ndegradation, stringent or higher tax could be considered for polluting activities.  \\nCommitment to Renewable Energy: As a part of its commitment to reduce CO2 emission, the \\nGovernment plans to  sharply increase the total generation of power from renewable duri ng the 8FYP.  The \\ntarget is to generate some 3700 MW of power from renewable energy.  To achieve this the Government \\nwould explore new technologies that can reduce cost and enhance Bangladesh’s  usage of renewable energy \\noptions , provide incentives to IPPs to invest in the production of renewable energy, and also provide \\nincentives to households to use renewable energy,  The Government will expand the work programme of \\nthe Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), which has  facilitated  the use of renewable \\nenergy in economic activities . \\n   \\n \\n497 \\n Decarbonisation  or A low -carbon economy (LCE)  \\nA low -carbon economy (LCE), low -fossil -fuel economy (LFFE), or decarbonised economy is an economy \\nbased on utilization low -carbon power sources as well as attaining energ y efficiency and energy \\nconservation resulting in a minimal output of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, \\nspecifically carbon dioxide.  Shifting to a low -carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial \\nbenefits both for developed an d developing countries. Many countries around the world are designing and \\nimplementing long term low -emission development strategies (LEDS). These strategies seek to achieve \\nsocial, economic, and environmental development goals while reducing long -term gre enhouse gas \\nemissions and increasing resilience to the effects of climate change. Decarbonised economy or low-carbon \\neconomies are therefore proposed as a means to avoid catastrophic climate change and as a precursor to net \\nzero-carbon economy.    \\nImproved Waste Management and Introduction of Circular Economy:  \\nWaste can be utilized as resource. It also considered as a great source of environmental pollution if not \\nproperly managed. A study projected that mixed municipal solid waste generation may rise up to 47,000 \\ntons/day by 2025 which is equivalent to 17.2 million tons/year. Local government division is trying to \\nmanage municipal mixed solid waste with their insufficient logistics and infrastructures. In addition, DoE \\nalong with concerned stakeholders have been working for sound management of waste through few pilot \\nprojects. Since waste collection rate ranges from 44.30% to 76.47% in major cities, therefore improved \\nwaste management is highly required. Improved waste management includes proper collection, s egregation \\nfor reuse, recycles and environmentally sound disposal.  Capacity building of concerned stakeholders, \\npublic awareness, strengthening monitoring and enforcement would be favourable  for the improvement. In \\naddition, relevant rules, guideline shou ld be put in place for better implementation.  \\nCurrent study shows that every year Tk. 10,706 million is being saved through recycling. Only 4 to 15% of \\nthe total generated waste is being recycled by the informal sector. Circular economy approach would be an \\nappropriate solution to this problem, which allows the materials constantly flow around a ‘closed loop’ \\nsystem, rather than being used once and then discarded. Circular economy confirms the best use of the \\nrecyclable items, which would result us several  benefits such as resource efficiency, less waste generation, \\nless land fill. Eventually, introducing circular economy for recyclable goods such as paper, metal, glass and \\nplastic would create an employment opportunity if the business model runs sustainabl y. Government \\nsupport such as capacity building, incentives, creating a market through bridging the supply and demand \\nmight be required for initiating recycling, waste to compost/biogas as well as energy project. 8th five-year \\nplan will focus on the fruitf ul application of the improved waste management and introduction of circular \\neconomy for sustainable use of resources.  \\nCleaner Coal: The Government is committed to diversify its fuel mix to reduce cost and ensure energy \\nsecurity for the future. In additio n to reducing reliance on fossil foil for power generation, the government \\nis also exploring options to adopt the cleanest technology possible while using fossil fuel.  While use of \\ncoal remains a part of the least - cost power generation strategy, the gove rnment will actively pursue the \\nadoption of  the cleanest form of technology for generation which carries the lowest environmental \\nimplications. This can be attained by remaining committed to high efficiency super -critical gasifier   \\n \\n498 \\n technology involving coal  as the primary fuel; and also adopting any new “green” improvements to the \\ntechnology of coal -based power generation.  \\nExpansion of Special Economic Zones with Effective Environmental Regulations: Ad hoc \\nindustrialization harms both the usage of land and also reduces the scope of effective environmental \\nmonitoring. Hence, the Government is committed to increase the number of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) \\nwith proper environmental regulations and infrastructure to ensure that industrial pollution is monitore d \\nand regulated under the 8FYP . This will also allow the concerned authorities to effectively impose \\nEnvironmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR) by effectively by monitoring pollution closely and enforcing any \\nfines for the violation of environmental regulations.  \\nPromoting Green Bricks: Traditional brick kilns  have been a major source of pollution and land \\ndegradation. As topsoil is removed for clay in the making of the bricks, this results in the loss of almost \\nthree -quarters of soil fertility. Moreover, the burni ng of the soil in the process of brick -making also \\ncontributes to emission. The Government acknowledges this and thus has adopted the Brick Making and \\nKiln Establishment Act 2013. The Department of Environment (DoE) has banned traditional kilns and \\nordered  their shutdown, even though the complete implementation of that instruction remains elusive. As a \\nresult, under the 8FYP , the Government will enhance its focus on moving to greener bricks by promoting \\nthe adoption of cleaner technological options. The Dep artment of Environment has also decided to extend \\nthe timeframe to adopt efficient technology for those with valid environment clearance certificates. The \\n2013 Act prohibits the establishment of brick fields in residential, protected, commercial and agricu ltural \\nareas, and also in forests, sanctuaries, wetlands and Ecological Critical Areas (ECAs), and lays down \\nprovisions for the imposition of heavy fines and prison sentences on violators. Under the Eighth Plan, the \\nGovernment will continue to enforce this  Act strictly to ensure that the brick makers  switch to eco -friendly \\ntechnologies that are less taxing on the environment.  \\nAdoption and enforcement of Green Building Rating System and Low Carbon Construction \\nMaterials:  The overall green building movement i s nearly two -decade old phenomenon . Growing \\nawareness about the adverse impacts of our use of resources on the environment and concern for national \\nenergy security across the world have led to the momentum to bring about transformation in the construction \\nindustry for achieving improved sustainability. Consequently, a national initiative will be taken to create \\npublic or private voluntary green building rating systems that serve the purpose of assessing buildings \\nagainst a set of performance criteria and re cognizing their superior environmental performance. Such rating \\nprogrammes provide guidance for design, construction, and operational practices in order to significantly \\nreduce the environmental impact of buildings. Expertise in sustainable buildings is pr omoted through \\ntraining, sharing of practical resources, certification and professional accreditation.  \\nIntroduction of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Policy in Plastic Management:  \\nThe uses of disposable plastic are increasing due to its low cost a nd multipurpose uses. Right now more \\nthan 10% of total mixed solid waste contains plastic. However, only 40% of total plastic is recycled and \\nremaining 40% used for land fill/dumped and 20% dumped in to the water body. Since the single use \\nplastic (one -time cup/plates, lollypop cover, sachet, Styrofoam, plastic cutlery, cigarette filter, cotton \\nbuds, coffee stirrers, small water/juice bottles, plastic bags) as well as multilayer packaging plastic is \\ndifficult to recycle, therefore producer/manufacturer/ imp orter/brand owner of the products should take   \\n \\n499 \\n the liability as his extended responsibility (EPR) for ensuring the environmentally sound management of \\ntheir products. On the other hand, there should be a phase out plan for minimizing disposable single use \\nplastic with the promotion of biodegradable plastic/suitable alternatives. However, to successfully \\nimplement the EPR, an intensive monitoring requires capacity building of the monitoring authorities such \\nas DoE with enhanced lab facilities, enhanced web -based online monitoring facilities, providing \\nnecessary support for sample collection facilities in the marine areas. In addition, relevant rules, \\nguidelines need to be functional, where collection, reduction, and recycling targets should be fixed. An \\nexclus ive fee system and percentage of product recyclability, proportion of recycled material in products \\nshould be established for betterment of the environment. 8th five-year plan will focus on the managing \\nplastic p ollution through EPR principle.  \\nBlue Economy : Bangladesh’s development progress in the future is dependent on its capacities to explore \\nin to untapped resources. Against that context, the 8th Plan will prioritize the exploration of marine resources \\nis increasingly becoming an area that Bangladesh is  looking forward to explore seriously, which makes Bay \\nof Bengal an open a source for valuable asset that also facilitates international trade and commerce. \\nFurthermore, with the settlement of maritime border disputes with India and Myanmar – there territo rial \\nwaters are now a ripe for developmental exploration. In particular, the maritime settlements have given \\nBangladesh entitlement on 118,813 km2 in the Bay of Bengal comprising her territorial sea. The shallow \\nshelf sea and continental shelf constitute a bout 20% and 35% respectively, the rest (45%) lying in deeper \\nwaters. As a result, under the 8FYP , the Government will explore the potential of the Blue Economy through \\na sustainable mechanism and identify adequate policies which will help formulate an opt imal investment \\nplan which can contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth, employment, and well -being while \\npreserving the health of the ocean.  BCCT has developed its long -term, mid -term and short -term plan under \\nBlue Economy. From CCTF, alrea dy a few projects have been undertaken which addressed the theme of \\nblue economy. From CCTF, two projects are being taken for capacity building, awareness raising and socio -\\neconomic development under blue economy.     \\nPromoting Green Technologies in the RMG  Sector and promotion of green jobs and SMEs: \\nBangladesh has one of the highest numbers of green RMG factories in the world, resulting from the \\nfavourable monetary policies initiated by the Government. The prominent barriers to the adoption of green \\ntechno logies in the RMG sector are: (i) large initial investments; (i)  i incentives weigh in favour of the large \\ncompanies which enjoy economies of scale; and (iii) limited commercial incentives from the demand side. \\nNonetheless, the Government will remain commi tted towards supporting the commercial initiatives which \\naim to “go green” through cheap financing instruments and favourable fiscal incentives that reduce their \\ncarbon footprints and environmental damages in Bangladesh.  \\nReducing Overuse of Chemicals in Ag riculture: The Government of Bangladesh is committed to \\nincorporate environmentally friendly technologies in the agricultural sector. This will involve undertaking \\nmeasures that limit the use of chemicals which are harmful to the environment in the agricul tural sector – \\nand draw more lessons from the Green Commodities Program by UNDP, which aims to make agriculture \\nmore sustainable.  \\nDrawing Lessons for an Effective Green Growth Strategy: Bangladesh can benefit from examining \\nvarious strategies for green gr owth that have been adopted in other developed as well as developing \\ncountries. For instance, Rwanda introduced the Green Growth and Climate Resilience National Strategy   \\n \\n500 \\n for Climate Change and Development in 2011, which hopes to establish a low carbon and climate resilient \\neconomy by 2050 through a secure supply of low -carbon energy, sustainable water and land use, and social \\nprotection (including reduction in the risks of disaster risk reduction). Moreover, Chile also launched its \\nNational Green Growth Str ategy in December 2013, which pinpoints action including environmental \\nmanagement instruments, promoting a market for environmental goods and services, and measuring \\nprogress over the short, medium and long term. These country experiences can help inform B angladesh – \\nand the Government is committed to draw lessons from such experiences to support its agenda for green \\ngrowth.  \\nIncreased Commitment to Green Transport System:  During  the 8FYP , the Government will support \\n“green transportation system”, which invo lves banning the vehicles that are old and emit excess smoke. \\nLevels of pollution resulting from an inefficient transport system will be reduced by providing fiscal \\nincentives for hybrid technologies, electric vehicles and imposing strict penalties for the  violation of \\nenvironmental codes  by polluters in the transportation sector.  \\nSupporting Eco -Tourism:  The Government will increase fiscal support for ecotourism under the 8FYP , \\nwhich protects the ecological integrity of tourist sites and facilitates the p rotection of bio -diversity in \\nBangladesh.  \\nPromoting sustainable production & consumption system in industries (SDG 12): During  the 8FYP , \\nthe Government will promote sustainable consumption and production , which  is about getting more done \\nwith lesser resources. It is also about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, \\nincreasing resource efficiency and  promoting sustainable lifestyles. Sustainable consumption and \\nproduction can also contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and the transition towards low -carbon \\nand green economies.  \\n8.5 ACTIVITIES TO BE UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE   \\nMobilizing  Resources for Climate Change Trust Fund:  The Government will remain committed to \\nstrengthening the Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) and will mobilize more than Taka 8000 crore under \\nthe 8 FYP to strengthen the Fund further as an instrument support programm es for adaptation and mitigation. \\nThe Bangladesh Climate Change Trust (BCCT), which is the Government body that overlooks the \\nutilization of the CCTF, will also develop an international partnership with the leading organizations \\nundertaking climate change adaptation and mitigation activities to draw lessons from the international \\nexperience, so that innovative projects are funded to support effective measures against climate change.     \\nUtilizing the Green Climate Fund (GCF):   The Green Climate Fund (GCF) i s a fund established within \\nthe framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as an \\noperating enti ty of the Financial Mechanism  to assist developing count ries in adaptation and  mitigation \\npractices to counter the effects o f climate change. Furthermore, as of 3rd February 2020, a n amount of US$ \\n10.3 billion was initially pledged to the GCF as climate finance; and some US$ 8.2 billion was confirmed. \\nNow, in order to access to the GCF the recipient countries have to ready them selves by meeting certain \\ncriteria and standards. Quite understandably, the member countries have to assign a National Designated \\nAuthority (NDA) to operate the Fund and support the National Implementation Entity (NIE)/Multilateral \\nImplementation Entity (M IE) to access the Fund. From Bangladesh, Economic Relations Division (ERD)   \\n \\n501 \\n of the Ministry of Finance has been nominated as the NDA. Additionally, only two national entities so far \\n– Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) and Palli Karma Sahaya k Foundation (PKSF) – \\nhave been accredited as NIE to partner with the GCF. And as of 30th April 2020, Bangladesh has received \\nfinancing for four projects, with a cumulative support of US$ 94.7 million. Hence, under the 8FYP , the \\nGovernment will take more m easures to accelerate the accreditation of more NIES.  \\nIncreased Oversight of the Climate Change Fund: The Government will ensure third party monitoring \\nof the Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF), so that the funds are not misused by any actors undertaking \\nunproductive projects. Proper usage of the CCTF is also essential as it will enhance Bangladesh’s credibility \\nas a responsible actor and will allow it to achieve greater access to the GCF.  \\nFormulation and Advancement of NAP Process: National Adaptation Plan (NAP) is expected to be the \\nmain strategic document under the UNFCCC process including GCF in the future to implement adaptation \\nactions in developing countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh is formulating the NAP process that is \\nexpected to be completed by 2022 with financial and technical support from the GCF and UNDP. The NAP \\nwill facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation into relevant new and existing policies, \\nprogrammes and activities in a coherent manner, in particular development plannin g processes and \\nstrategies, within all relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate. The NAP will give priorities in \\nNature Based Solution (NBS) and Ecosystem Based Adaptation (EbA).  \\nTechnology Transfer on Adaptation and Mitigation: DoE will en hance the activities to facilitate the \\ntechnology transfer on adaptation and mitigation from developed countries through Climate Technology \\nCentre  and Network (CTCN) and Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM).     \\nIncreased Commitment to Forestry and Biodiversity:  Forestry is an import mechanism to store carbon \\nfrom the atmosphere. It not only enriches the biodiversity in the environment, but also prevents the erosion \\nof land and acts as a shield during cyclones and storms. Consequently, the Government will remain \\ncommitted to both conserving and expanding the coverage of forests in Bangladesh to 15.2% by 2025 and \\nto 20% by 2041. This will involve expanding the forestation programme and increasing resources for social \\nforestry. In particular, the existing coastal af forestation , enrichment plantation and assisted natural \\nregeneration will be continued. The existing mature coastal plantations will remain for reinforcing green \\nbelt. An area of 50,000 ha will be planted and replanted in the coastal areas. Additionally, a n estimated \\n1,30,580  ha land of hill forests and 7,220  ha of plain land forests will be planted during the 8FYP  period.  \\nProductivity of the plantations will have to be increased. Multipurpose trees will receive special attention \\nto increase the productivi ty of land under forests.  Lastly, greater importance will be given to the Sundarbans \\nReserved Forest for the conservation of its biodiversity. A wide array of measures will be taken to conserve \\nand protect wildlife, with special attention to the Royal Beng al Tiger.  \\nImproved Understanding of Climate Change in the Local Government:  A key mechanism for the \\nGovernment to enhance the national capacity to improve the measures for adaption to climate change is \\nthrough an increased understanding of how climate ch ange is likely to affect the livelihood of local \\ncommunities within the local government administration. This will help identify localized solutions to \\nimprove the effectiveness of measures for adaptation – and enhance the state of adaptive capacity in the  \\nlocal government.    \\n \\n502 \\n Increased Partnership with the NGOs and Civil Society Actors: Measures for adaptation to climate \\nchange  require community wide cooperation, which emerge from partnerships with different stakeholders \\nsuch as NGOs and relevant actors from  the civil society. Such partnerships allow the community -based \\nadaptation measures to gain efficiency by building a participatory process facilitating improved \\ncoordination and knowledge sharing at the local levels.  \\nDeveloping Gender -Inclusive Climate Ch ange Response Framework:  The Bangladesh Climate Change \\nStrategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), 7th Five Year Plan (FYP), and National Plan for Disaster Management \\n(NPDM) all address the issue of women’s greater vulnerability to climate change and sensitivity t o disaster \\nevents. Therefore, the Government will take measures to increase women’s knowledge of environmental \\nmanagement and conservation, and investments will be made in education, capacity building training, \\ntechnology transfer, and environmental projec ts focusing on women.   \\nAddressing Climate Change Induced Migration: Erosion of land and the loss of rural livelihood can \\ntrigger urban migration from rural communities. As a result, under the 8FYP , the Government will remain \\ncommitted to design cities tha t make them more accommodative by installing efficient systems for \\nfacilitating migrant integration into the city, adequate housing for new populations, and job opportunities \\nfor those who are looking to work. The Government will closely work with the urba n planners to ensure \\nthat the needs of the community are being met and that all who seek to migrate from the regions vulnerable \\nto the impacts of climate change are able to do so.   \\nGender Focus of Climate Action: The gender transformative climate action wi ll be a key government \\npriority.   The government has undertaken a gender transformati ve climate action in coastal district to \\nsupport 700 thousand coastal populations  with more climate resilient drinking water, livelihoods and early \\nwarning system. This pr oject is going to ensure the women as a key change agent in promoting resilient \\nlivelihoods, drinking water and early warning systems. The government will also ensure that climate actions \\non the ground are  also addressing the needs of the most vulnera ble population so that the principles of \\nLNOB are  mainstreamed across climate actions of the  government . This will continue will be scaled up \\nafter assessing results.  Recently an initiative has been taken to review and update the Climate Change and \\nGender Actio n Plan under MoEFCC.  \\nGovernance of Climate Finance:   Proper use of climate finance resources is an important aspect of overall \\ncountry readiness to access and utilize the climate finance. The capacity and role of parliament, IMED, and \\nOAG are will be enhan ced in improving governance mechanism for climate finance. Climate budget report \\ncan be also mainstreamed into MP budget tracking system to those areas, which are climate hotspots.   \\nImproved Management of Water Pollution: Improving the state of water mana gement remains one of \\nthe most important objectives of Government. As discussed in the preceding section, the quality of surface \\nwater faces two distinct threats: salinity and pollution. As a result, under the 8FYP , the Government will \\nimplement effective measures to improve the state of water quality in Bangladesh. These measures are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Increased monitoring of the quality of water from tube wells in arsenic -prone areas on a routine \\nbasis and the implementation of remedial actions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Basin -wide management to check all sources of pollution.    \\n \\n503 \\n \\uf0b7 Increased protection of the resource base of surface water in greater Dhaka (Dhaka, Tongi, Gazipur, \\nand Narayangonj) by taking appropriate actions for cleaning the rivers, especially: Buriganga, Balu, \\nTurag and Sitalakhya.  \\n\\uf0b7 Protection and recovery of public water bodies from encroachment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exploration of options for harvesting rainwater.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment and implementation of effective regulations to control the discharge of cooling water \\nfrom the power stations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improvement of th e compliance monitoring system for industries and development projects and its \\neffective implementation. On -line ETP monitoring of all industries and economic zones. IOT based \\nmetering and monitoring for reducing leakage and corruption.  \\n\\uf0b7 On-line water quali ty monitoring of Dhaka watershed area. Expansion of online water quality \\nmonitoring system to other ecologically significant areas and urban pollution hotspots.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing strategy for managed aquifer recharge and introducing natural and artificial aquifer  \\nrecharge systems using rainwater harvesting for groundwater recharge.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing stringent water quality criteria for ECAs and RAMSAR sites to improve the ecosystem \\nand biodiversity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduction of the use of harmful chemicals in agriculture and  increase i n the distribution of proper \\nfiltration and cleaning systems, either on a large scale or household -based, where water is already \\ncontaminated, to improve the access to clean water.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment and implementation of Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP ) to control the \\ndischarge of wastewater from the industrial zone.  \\n\\uf0b7 Installation of ETPs in all the industries along with an online monitoring system to improve the \\nsurface water and groundwater  quality Implementing Zero discharge plan in the effluent \\ndisch arging industries to ensure better resource management.    \\nControlling Noise Pollution: The Government acknowledges that noise pollution remains a key \\nenvironmental and health hazard in Bangladesh. Thus, under the 8FYP , the following activities will be \\ncarried out to control noise pollution: {i} Execution and enforcement of the ‘Noise Pollution Control \\nRegulation -2006’; {ii} Undertaking programmes through electronic and social media to raise awareness \\namong drivers on noise pollution; {iii} The Government wi ll Plantation of green trees and shrubs along \\nroads, hospitals, educational institutions etc. by the Government to help reduced noise by a considerable \\nextent; {iv} Collection of information/data on the level of noise in different divisional cities and pub lication \\nof reports on it; {v} establishing silence zones near the residential areas, educational institu tions and above \\nall, near hospitals.  \\nManaging Solid Waste:  The Government is committed to build facilities for the treatment of waste in all \\nmajor cit ies. This can be complemented with tax rebates and financial incentives for the production of \\nenvironmentally friendly products, including energy efficient appliances, recycled materials, sustainable \\npaper products etc. The Government will also be committe d to establish waste -based power plants which \\nwill produce electricity from solid waste and create economic incentives for both municipalities and private \\nsector waste management companies.    \\n \\n504 \\n 8.6 FOREST SUBSECTOR  \\n8.6.1  Performance of Forest Sub -sector during  7FYP  \\nThere was a vision to achieve 20 per cent  forest coverage by the end of 2020 as expected in the Twenty \\nYears Master Plan (1995 -2015) prepared for Forestry Sub - sector. In line with the above objectives, \\nplantation target of 149,000 hectares was fixed f or the plan period. Consequently, many development \\nprojects have been implemented with the financial assistance from development partners, Bangladesh \\nClimate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF), Bangladesh Climate Change Resilient Fund (BCCRF) as well as \\ngovernment’ s own resources.  \\nThe forest subsector contributes to 1.6 per cent of GDP and 12 per cent of agricultural GDP. The sector \\ngrew at an annual average rate of 6.1 per cent during the first four years the 7FYP plan with the growth \\nrates being more robust in the  last fiscal year (8.3 per cent). The 7th plan objectives for the sector were to \\nconserve and protect forest ecosystems for biodiversity and overall environmental stability, and expand \\nafforestation programmes for poverty alleviation and employment generat ion. A visible progress has been \\nmade during the plan period which is reflected in the growth performance of the sector. The total forest \\nland in Bangladesh stood at 2,300  thousand hectares, which is around 15.58 per cent of country area . The \\nprotected are a increased from 11.56% to about 19.78% of the forest land  during the 7th plan implementation period.   \\nThe ever -increasing population of Bangladesh is imparting pressure on existing government managed forest \\nresources resulted to it’s over exploitation.  A number of programmes have been implemented to achieve \\nthe strategic objectives in the 7FYP. As such, marginal land utilization through peoples’ participation for \\nforest development have been launched in early eighties and continued till the present five -year plan. A \\nparticipatory social forestry got momentum involving surrounding poor peoples and forest dependent \\ncommunities during the plan period. Coastal afforestation in newly accreted chars in the coastal areas was \\ngiven due emphasis. Plantation along r oad side and embankments were expanded. Between 2009 and 2020 , \\na total of 104 million saplings , 113.1 thousand hectares block plantation and 24,633  km strip plantation  \\nwere raised . Till to date, a bout 701, 488 nos. poor people is involved in Social Forestry  Programme. About \\nBDT  1047.7 million distributed among 73,471nos.  social forestry participants (female \\nparticipant16,707nos.) under the program during the plan period.  \\nThe national forest inventory conducted during 2016 -2019 shows that the forest cover is 12.8% of the \\ncountry which is 14.1% of the country’s land area. Field inventory shows that growing stock (commercial \\nwood volume) is 384 million cu.m., carbon stock is 1276 million tons (considering 5 carbon pool), tree \\nbasal area is 4.52 sq.m, per hectare , seedling density is 1419 per hectare for the country.  Forest area contains \\n22% of country’s carbon stock and 66% of growing stock is coming from trees outside forests (ToF). \\nCollected tree and forest products contributed 3.11% of 2018 -19 GDP. Several mod ules e.g. Bangladesh \\nForest Inventory (BFI), BFIS Geoportal, Emission Factor Database, Tree Identification database, \\nAllometrice Equation database etc. were developed and hosted in BFIS to support the assessment and \\nmonitoring the trees, forests, carbon an d biomass etc. in Bangladesh. Forest reference emission level is \\nestimated for the country and submitted to the UNFCCC which is available in the UNFCCC website and BFIS.     \\n \\n505 \\n Botanical survey in the five districts of Chittagong  division  and the Chittagong Hill  Tracts area ( viz. \\nChattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Bandarban, Khagrachari and Rangamati) has been done . An updated web -based \\nplant species database has been launched as http://bnh -flora.gov.bd/  under the program.  \\nGovernmen t emphasized to increase tree cover age in tree outsides forest (ToF) and will continue for the \\nnext plan period. Institutions, road and railway sides, embankments, chars, homesteads and other fellow \\nlands were brought under plantations to increase the tree  cover age, which is supporting the rural livelihood, \\nsupplying timber, fuel wood . At the same time ToF in Bangladesh playing key role in carbon sequestration. \\nAn assessment of tree cover age using satellite imagery showed that the tree cover age is 22.37% of  the \\ncountry.   \\nSeveral initiatives were undertaken to conserve biodiversity in the forest area including the Sundarbans. \\nForest Department carried out 2nd camera trap -based tiger census in Sundarbans .  \\nGovernment has taken initiative for watershed manageme nt in Chittagong Hill Tracts through participatory \\nwatershed co -management activity to regulate the water cycle, reduce soil erosion, reduce deforestation and \\nforest degradation and enhance tree cover age and carbon stock. This activity will continue for th e next plan \\nperiod. About 28 co -management organizations have been formed in protected areas for wildlife and \\nbiodiversity conservation.  \\nAn updated  Forest Policy 2016 is yet to approve  which focuses on addressing the emerging environmental \\nand socioeconom ic challenges in the context of climate change and extensive loss of forest cover in the \\ncountry The FIP, FMP and National Conservation Strategy  (NCS)  presents strategies and action plans \\naimed at conservation and sustainable management of forests  which re quires adequate funding to \\nimplement . The Bangladesh Delta Plan has been adopted where a special attention has been given on \\neffective and sustainable biodiversity conservation in the country.  \\n8.6.2  Challenges of Forest Sub -sector  \\nTo undertake necessary measures during this plan period, major challenges of this sub -sector are mentioned \\nbelow:   \\n\\uf0b7 Land record and demarcation: The absence of proper documentation and conspicuous demarcation \\nof forest lands and lengthy procedures for disposing land -related court  cases have been encouraging \\nunauthorized and illegal possession and encroachment by influential quarters.  \\n\\uf0b7 Protection of forest and forest resources: Increasing gap between demand and supply of timber, \\nfuel wood  and other forest resources created increase d pressure on forest resulting into forest \\ndegradation and diminishing ecosystem services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Productivity: The productivity of wood in the government forest is in the range of 0.5 -2.5 \\nm3/ha/year which is 7 -9 m3/ha/year for homestead. The low productivity is considered as a great \\nchallenge  to meet increasing demand of timber in the country . \\n\\uf0b7 Low per capita forest land: Available per capita forestland is the lowest in the world. Coastal \\nafforestation in the newly accreted land is the only option to balance the p er capita forestland under   \\n \\n506 \\n increasing trend of population. Considerable proportion of hill forests is degraded due to law and \\norder and socio -political situation and subsequently not bringing the areas under -vegetation cover.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of awareness: Lack of awa reness about various services provided by the forest ecosystem , \\nimportance of planting trees to mankind and addresses  the climate change impact .   \\n\\uf0b7 Regime shift in forest degradation: The recent influx of Rohingya refugees in the hilly areas of \\nCox’s Bazar and Bandarban caused a large damage to the forest land. More than 2,000 hectares of \\nforest area have been lost.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of financing: Inadequate financing has been observed during the last plan period and thus \\nposed challenge to achieve forest restoration tar get. Similarly, private sector investment to expand \\neco-tourism facilities is relatively low in this country.  \\n\\uf0b7 Institutional coordination : To ensure optimum benefit of forest ecosystem services both from the \\nforestland and tree outside forest need to enhanc e institutional coordination and establish effective \\nmulti -dimensional response system. It needs appropriate institutional framework with adequately \\ntrained manpower to confront challenges for sustainable forest management. At the same time, \\ndelayed proces s in land reservation, lease of forest land by the land administration, conflicts \\nbetween sectoral plans and policies for using forest land for different economic activities is \\nhampering the forest management.   \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate human resources and logistics: For est land and resources growing over it are both scarce \\nand valuable and in an overpopulated country like Bangladesh suffering from unemployment and \\npoverty, protection of these valuable open resources is quite  difficult. Moreover, multidimensional \\nactiviti es like wildlife and eco -tourism management, periodical updates of national forest inventory \\nand National Red List of Flora & Fauna, regular updating of plant species information for plantation \\nand conservation, promotion of eco -system services, climate ch ange mitigation and adaptation \\nactivities, carbon sequestration and trading etc. are now associated with forest conservation. It \\nneeds appropriate institutional framework with adequately trained manpower to face future \\nchallenges for sustainable forest man agement. It also requires re -structuring of Forest Department \\nfor strengthening capacities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Absence of knowledge network, information system and learning: In absence of knowledge \\nnetwork, information system and learning, forestland has been prescribed for other land uses such \\nas private plantation of rubber, orange and non -traditional fruits like chalta, olive, wood apple, \\ncashewnut, amloki, horitaki, bohera, lotkon etc. causing loss of ecosystem benefits and \\nbiodiversity.  At the same time, updated informa tion on plant and animal species is limited which \\nneeds to establish a knowledge sharing mechanism for better conservation and management of \\nforest biodiversity.  \\n8.6.3 Objectives of the  Forest Sub -Sector  during  the 8FYP  \\nThe development vision of the forest  sector is aligned with the Bangladesh Forestry Master Plan 2016 -36 \\nand National Forest Policy 2016 and other climate change and natural resources conservation plans .

Site specific \\nprotection plans shall be prepared to protect the remaining fragments of hill forests. Enrichment plantations \\nshall be carried out where necessary. Information, education and co mmunication (IEC) campaigns shall be \\nundertaken. Legal provisions relevant to forest protection will be reviewed and improved. Local \\ncommunities will be actively involved in conserving natural forests even through such measures as benefit -\\nsharing. Protecti on and management of Sundarban will be particularly strengthened and navigation of ships \\nin Sundarban will be regulated to minimise chances of oil spills.  Watershed co -management activities to \\nregulate water, increase tree cover and halt the deforestation and forest degradation will be implemented in \\nhill forest.  Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism to support \\nthe forest restoration and enhancement of the carbon stock in hill forest will be implemented.  \\nReforestation /restoration of degraded state forests: Degraded/denuded sta te forests will be reforested/ \\nafforested on emergency basis. This will be attempted through reducing deforestation and forest \\ndegradation, assisted natural regeneration (ANR) and plantations, dep ending upon site and situation -\\nspecific requirements. Extent of land needing reforestation or restoration will be reassessed. A watershed \\nmanagement approach to reforestation shall be adopted and soil and moisture conservation measures will \\nbe included in plantation or ANR projects.  Participatory forest management approach will continue for \\nreducing the deforestation and forest degradation through involving the local and poor people.  Inter-\\nministerial and departmental coordination will be strengthened to e nsure the land in coastal region to \\nestablish the green belt to protect the coastal community and stabilize lands.  \\nCoastal afforestation and creation of a coastal greenbelt: Creation of a coastal green belt shall be a high \\npriority activity. Coastal affore station with climate resilient mangrove and other species on unused public \\nlands and char lands  shall be carried out. Land may be acquired for coastal plantations if suitable public \\nland is not available. Expansion of the mangroves for establishing green b elt towards the coastal region will \\ncontinue during the plan period. Institutional areas, roadsides, embankments, dykes and all available land \\nshall be planted to complete the greenbelt. Special attention will be given in designing and allocating of \\nfunds for coastal forest management, along with polder and embankment management.  \\nManagement of protected areas and protection of wildlife: Conservation of wildlife and biodiversity \\nshall be carried out in accordance with the Wildlife Master Plan 2015. The prot ected area management \\nincluding co -management shall be strengthened. The PA network will be sustainably expanded up to 25 \\nper cent of state forests within the plan period. Role and structure of Wildlife Divisions shall be reviewed. \\nWildlife circle shall be  upgraded to the level of a wing of the department. The newly created Wildlife \\nCentre, the Wildlife Crime Control Unit and the forensics laboratory shall be strengthened, among other \\nthings. Control on poaching of wildlife outside forests and PAs shall be given special attention.  Feasibility \\nstudies will be conducted to identify the wildlife corridors, habitat and marine resources for biodiversity \\nconservation. Management framework will be developed to manage the marine protected areas.  \\n   \\n \\n509 \\n Promotion of fuel w ood saving devices and technologies: Fuel wood amounts to more than 80 per cent \\nof all wood consumed in the country and are  a major demand on natural forests. Networking with relevant \\ngovernment agencies and NGOs promoting renewable energy will be strength ened and subsidies for \\nadoption of improved cook stoves, solar cookers, biogas etc. will be provided among forest dependent \\ncommunities.  \\nProtecting and conserving the Sundarbans: Due importance will be given to the Sundarbans Reserved \\nForest for its biodiv ersity conservation. Different measures will be taken to conserve and protect wildlife \\nwith special attention to Bengal Tiger. The activities of \\'Emergency Tiger Response Team\\' and \\'Village \\nTiger Response Team (VTRT)\\' constituted with the local peoples of surrounding villages will be continued \\nfor relaying stray tigers.  Community engagement will be strengthened for resource management. Status of \\nprey and predator will be assessed during the plan period. Strategic environmental Assessment (SEA) for \\nconservin g outstanding Universal value of the Sundarbans is underway. A SEA report and Environmental \\nManagement Plan (EMP) will be developed for Sundarbans in the plan period which will be effective till 2041.  \\nStrengthening forest & tree monitoring and information systems:  National Forest Inventory (bio -\\nphysical, socio economic component and land cover mapping), tree cover assessment and mapping will be \\nconducted for monitoring the forest and tree resources and policy formulation for forest management. Green \\nHouse G as inventory for forestry sector to update the forest reference level also will be conducted. \\nInformation exists in the existing modules of the BFIS will be updated and new modules will be identified \\nand integrated in the BFIS to strength the monitoring of  the natural resources in the plan period.  \\nExpanding social forestry and urban biodiversity:  Social forestry has become a social movement in \\nBangladesh. Social forestry programmes will continue for expansion and strengthening of upazila nurseries, \\nunion le vel nurseries, and for strengthening nursery training centres. An estimated 15,000 km. of strip \\nplantations will be raised during the plan period. Forest Department will lead the  afforestation and social \\nforestry programme s at the root level with the help of Local Government and NGOs. Creation of riparian \\nforest buffer along the bank of all the rivers and canals involving the local people will be encouraged to \\nincrease the tree cover in the country. Such strategy will not only create opportunity for increas ing tree \\ncover but also mitigate environmental challenges and improve agricultural productivity including enhance \\necosystem services during the plan period. In addition, in the context of growing urbanisation , the 8FYP \\nwill pursue two major strategies : First, ensure that urbanisation  does not expand to peripheral ecosystem \\nand second, conserve the biodiversity of the cities and town with active role of local environmental  actions.  \\nConservation of hill forest areas:  Restoration and conservation of the hill f orest for maintaining \\necosystem has been one of the major focused areas of intervention under the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. \\nSide by side, there has been considerable plantation target for forest cover improvement, watershed \\nmanagement, biodiversity conse rvation and soil conservation within the 7th Five Year Plan. But \\nachievement of this target remained challenging due to the complex local politics and enduring land tenure \\nconflict. Therefore, special measures will be taken for hill forest restoration and conservation through \\nresolving existing complex local politics and land tenure conflict within the plan period. Side by side, \\nincreased access to the livelihood benefits will be offered to the dependent communities to enhance \\nconservation of hill forest. U nclassed State Forest (USF) largely remained vacant and underutilized since \\nlong ago. Appropriate measures will be initiated in this USF land for enhancing economic growth, \\necosystem services and sustainable development.  Participatory watershed co -manageme nt activities \\nthrough assisted natural regeneration and enrichment plantation will continue during the plan period.    \\n \\n510 \\n It is vital for assessment of plant genetic resources as well as biodiversity loss of the country. Repeated \\nbotanic survey at 10 to 20 year s intervals can help to understand changing pattern of biodiversity. The \\nupdated knowledge of botanic survey is very important for effective forest management and conservation \\nof biodiversity. Botanical survey of Chittagong and the Chittagong hill tracts h as already been completed \\nunder 7FYP. A strategic action plan has taken to complete the botanical survey remaining areas of the \\ncountry.  \\nTrees outside forests:  Potential lands (e.g. marginal fellow lands, roadside, embankment etc.) can be used \\nto increase the trees outside forest through signing agreements between Forest Department and related \\ngovernment organizations to increase the country’s tree cover to 24%.  \\nStrengthening institutional Capacity: Adequate manpower and logistics is essential to achieve th e targets \\nof 8FYP  in forestry sector. It is crucial to approve the Forest Department’s proposed organogram so that \\nForest Department could be adequately resourced to face the future challenges related to forest management \\nand climate change issues.  \\nStrengt hening forestry and biodiversity research: The Bangladesh Forest Research Institute (BFRI), \\nBangladesh National Herbarium (BNH) and other institutions and universities involved in forestry research \\nwill be supported through regular research grants. Institu tional issues, such as staff shortages, IT \\ninfrastructure, research facilities, etc. faced by the BFRI and BNH shall be resolved at the earliest. The \\ncapacity building training programmes for the people involved in the forestry and diversity sector with \\nemphasis of scientist of BFRI will be organised on a regular basis for developing human resources.  \\nStrengthen the A ctivities of Bangladesh Rubber Board  \\nBeing a new institution Bangladesh Rubber Board is planning to improve its institutional capacity through  \\nrecruiting staffs, increasing modern equipment and laboratory facilities, strengthening the present \\nmanpower situation as well as human resource development.  \\nBangladesh has already become a member of two international organizations, Association of Natura l \\nRubber Producing Countries (ANRPC) & International Rubber Research and Development Board (IRRDB. \\nFinding out, collect and cultivate the most suitable rubber breed for our country, formulating and \\nimplementing international standard rubber policy and acti vely participating in the competitive rubber \\nmarket are some key objectives of these memberships. Bangladesh Rubber Board aims to increase the \\nproduction of natural latex to self -sufficient level, thus meeting the local demand and save foreign currency. \\nThe Government has formulated a wide array of measures to implement The Wildlife (Preserve and Safety) \\nAct, 2012. Bangladesh Rubber Board is aiming to make liaison with forest department and help mitigating \\nthis wildlife crisis.  \\n8.7 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – THE  WAY FORWARD  \\nThe Government aims to support the management of the environment in the long -run by adopting the broad \\nstrategies of the Delta Plan 2100, and also integrate Environmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR) into economic \\nplanning. The agenda is to ensure th at economic necessities and aspirations are addressed in a sustainable \\nmanner, so that environmental concerns find a central place in developmental planning. As the Perspective   \\n \\n511 \\n Plan 2041 aims to transform Bangladesh into an Upper Middle -Income Country by 2 031 and a High -Income \\nCountry by 2041 – special attention is needed on the management of the environment to chart out a \\nsustainable pathway of development. Hence, the Eighth Plan becomes a key strategic document to achieve \\nthese short, medium and long -term objectives. Against that context, the Government will use the Eighth \\nPlan to guide economic progress while simultaneously maintaining a strong level on climate change \\nadaptation and mitigation to climate change, the capacity to manage disasters and sound management of \\nthe environment to attain the dynamics of green growth.  \\nNonetheless, the Eighth Plan will remain a flexible document and it takes into account the fa ct that changes \\nin the prioritisation of activities are  possible if the economic, environmen tal or social needs demand such \\nchanges. As noted earlier, the Government has already formulated key strategic documents and policy \\ndirections such as the Delta Plan 2100, the National Susta inable Development Strategy,  and National  Plan \\nfor Disaster Manage ment and the Standing Orders on Disasters, which collectively shape how the \\npolicymakers aim to prioritize the concerns about the environment. And to this end, Bangladesh is \\nprioritizing both international partnerships for development and the mobilization of internal resources to \\naddress the constraint of resources in the environmental sector. In particular, under the Eighth Plan, \\ninitiating Environmental Fiscal Reforms (EFR) will become one of the central agendas in planning for the \\nenvironment – as the Go vernment is committed to introduce both “beneficiary pays” and “polluter pays” \\nprinciples in managing the concerns about the environment. Accordingly, the Eighth Plan highlights a \\nsubstantial increase in the allocations in the Annual Development Programmes  (ADP) dealing with \\nsustainable development programmes for sustainable development (Table 8. 6) – which aims to keep \\nBangladesh on track to achieve the targets set out in the Perspective Plan 2041 and the Delta Plan 2100.  \\n8.8 DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN  THE 8th PLAN  \\nThe su stainable development agenda is cross -cutting in nature and involve collaborative efforts of a large \\nnumber of ministries.  So, the total amount of resources involved in financing the implementation of the \\nsustainable development strat egy is large and spread over the work programme of several ministries \\nincluding agriculture, water, land, local government division, etc.  However, the Ministry of Environment, \\nForest and Climate Change provide s coordinating functions and play s a lead role  in developing and \\nenforcing environmental policies.  The capacity of this lead ministry will be sharply strengthened to play \\nthis coordinating role, to liaise  with the international agenda for climate change and for monitoring progress. \\nThe management of forestry resources will also be enhanced through better planning, monitoring, \\ninvestments and enforcements. Accordingly, the Eighth Plan proposes a significant increase in the ADP \\nallocations for the Ministry (Tables 8. 6). \\nTable 8. 6: ADP Allocation for Env ironment and Climate Change during  8FYP  \\n (Taka billion Current Prices)  \\nMinistry /Sector  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change  9.4 11.5 13.3 15.5 18.6 \\nSector Total  9.4 11.5 13.3 15.5 18.6 \\n(Taka billion 2 021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry /Sector  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change  9.4 11.0 12.0 13.4 15.3 \\nSector Total  9.4 11.0 12.0 13.4 15.3 \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1    \\n \\n512 \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 9:  \\nHOUSING AND COMMUNITY AMENITIES  \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n515 \\n CHAPTER 9  \\nURBAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  \\n9.1 INTRODUCTION  \\nIn view of the central role played by cities in most countries in creating national wealth, enhancing social \\nand economic development, and attracting direct foreign inves tment, urbanization has now become \\nsynonymous with economic development. Analysis of macro data in different countries support this \\ngeneralization, since the countries that have experienced the most rapid economic growth rates also have \\nhigher urbanization  levels whereas those with slower growth rates continue to have a large percentage of \\ntheir labour force engaged in agriculture, and have relatively low levels of urbanization. In fact, no country \\nhas ever reached upper income status witho ut a signiﬁcant  population shift into cities.  The way that cities \\nare managed and administered has a direct bearing on their ability to combine safe and healthy living \\nconditions that can improve quality of life for all citizens, including the poor.  \\nBangl adesh has been experiencing rapid increase in its urban population ever since its independence in \\n1971. Urban population as a percentage of total population increased from about 8 per cent  in 2074 to nearly \\n28 per cent  in 2011.  If this trend continues , by the year 2050 more than 50 per cent  of the population is \\nexpected to be living in urban areas. Concurrently Bangladesh is undergoing profound changes in its \\neconomic structure. The dependence on agriculture has fallen sharply with commensurate increases i n \\nmanufacturing and services. The availability of urban land, urban infrastructure, and urban services has \\nlagged behind substantially compared to the demand for these services thereby creating supply constraints \\nand cost pressures. Unless this urbanizatio n challenge is managed effectively, there will be a serious risk \\nthat the growth momentum will be constrained by the urban pressure.  \\n9.2 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL S (SDG s), NEW URBAN   AGENDA \\n(NUA) AND THE 8th FIVE YEAR PLAN  \\nOn September 25, 2015 the UN Gene ral Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda for Sustainable \\nDevelopment. The agenda outlines 17 sustainable development goals and its associated 169 targets. The \\nNew Urban Agenda was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban \\nDevelopment (Habitat III) in Quito, Ecuador, on 20 October 2016. It was endorsed by the United Nations \\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty -eighth plenary meeting of the seventy -first session on 23 December 2016. \\nThe New Urban Agenda represents a shared vis ion for a better and more sustainable future by taking \\nadvantage of the opportunities presented by urbanization as an engine of sustained and inclusive economic \\ngrowth, social and cultural development, and environmental protection.  \\nThe Sustainable Developm ent Goal -11 calls for Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, \\nresilient and sustainable. The targets for achieving this goal include the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, an d upgrade \\nslums    \\n \\n516 \\n \\uf0b7 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, \\nimproving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of \\nthose in vulnerable situations  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2030,  enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacities for participatory, integrated \\nand sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of affected people and  decrease the \\neconomic losses relative to GDP caused by disasters, including water -related disasters, with the focus \\non protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, includin g by paying special \\nattention to air quality, municipal and other waste management  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, \\nparticularly for women and children, older persons and persons with disabiliti es  \\n\\uf0b7 Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri -urban and rural areas \\nby strengthening national and regional development planning  \\n\\uf0b7 By 2020 increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integr ated \\npolicies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, \\nresilience to disasters.  \\n \\nThe shared vision represented by the New Urban Agenda calls for a better and more sustainable future \\nthrough the urban s ystems and physical form of our urban spaces that will ensure and enable people to have \\nequal rights and access to the benefits and opportunities that cities can offer. To achieve this vision, the \\nNUA lays out standards and principles for the planning, con struction, development, management, and \\nimprovement of urban areas guided by the following interlinked principles:  \\n\\uf0b7 Sustainable urban development for social inclusion and ending poverty including the promotion of \\nhealth and well -being and elimination of all  forms of discrimination by providing equal access for all \\nto physical and social infrastructure and basic services, as well as adequate and affordable housing.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Sustainable and inclusive urban prosperity and opportunities for all by promoting full and pro ductive \\nemployment and decent work for all and by ensuring equal access for all to economic and productive \\nresources and opportunities.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Environmentally sustainable and resilient urban development by promoting clean energy and \\nsustainable use of land and r esources in urban development, by protecting ecosystems and biodiversity, \\nby building urban resilience, by reducing disaster risks and by mitigating and adapting to climate \\nchange.  \\nAs one of the member states involved in adopting the UN Resolution on Susta inable Development Goals \\nand New Urban Agenda, Bangladesh is committed to work hard for reaching the SDG goals and NUA \\nvisions. SDG goal -11 and the NUA provides an opportunity for policy makers to mobilize collective efforts \\nfor inclusive and sustainable u rban development. The 8th Five Year Plan puts special emphasis on \\nformulation of strategies to reflect the recommendations of SDG and NUA. For m aking cities inclusive, \\nsafe, resilient and sustainable and empowering people to have equal rights and access to  the benefits and \\nopportunities that cities can offer concrete actions would be required on a number of areas: Spatial   \\n \\n517 \\n development, institutional development, development of infrastructure and services, urban land and \\nhousing development, urban environment al improvement, and climate  change and disaster management. \\nHowever, to do so and achieve the SDG  Targets and NUA vision we need to analyse the processes and \\npatterns of urbanization in the country, identify the issues and challenges, formulate strategies and translate \\nthe strategies into concrete actions.  \\n9.3 PATTERNS AND TRENDS OF URBANI SATION IN BANGLADESH  \\n9.3.1 Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Urban Growth  \\nBangladesh is a lowly urbanized country if compared with high income countries but its rate of urbaniz ation \\nis one of the highest in the world. Urbanization in the country has been more rapid during recent decades. \\nIn 1961 the urban population was 2.6 million or only 4.8% of the total population. The figure reached 22.45 \\nmillion or 20.15 per cent  of the to tal population in 1991. By 2011 around 28 per cent  of the country’s \\npopulation became urban residents. More than 60 million people was estimated to be living in urban areas \\nof the country in 2018 accounting for about 36 per cent  of the country’s population  (Figure 9.1).   This is \\nindicative of the fact that growth of urban population and labour  force is increasing relative to rural \\npopulation and labour  force. In fact, the annual exponential growth rates of population in the urban areas in \\nBangladesh have co nsistently outpaced the growth rate of total population in the country in each and every \\ncensus conducted in the  period 1951 -2011 (Figure 9.2).  \\nFigure 9.1: Level of Urbanization in Different Years  \\n \\nSource: Population Census, 2011, WUP -2018 Revision for 20 18 estimate  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 5.198.7815.5420.1523.812836.6\\n1961 1974 1981 1991 2001 2011 2018% of Population Urban\\nYear  \\n \\n518 \\n Figure 9.2: Growth of Urban and Total Population  \\n \\n                Source:  BBS  Population Census, 2011 (Analytical Report, 2015)  \\nThe population division of the United Nations estimated that nearly 58% people of Bangladesh will live in \\nurban areas in 2051 ( Figure 9.3) . This is indicative of the fact that growth of urban population and labour  \\nforce is increasing relative to rural population and labour  force. In fact, the annual exponential growth rates \\nof population in the urban areas in Ban gladesh have consistently outpaced the growth rate of total \\npopulation in the country in each and every census conducted in the period 1951 -2011 (Figure 9.2 above).  \\nAn examination of the level of urbanization and share of national urban population for each  of the six \\ndivisions reveals that Dhaka Division overwhelmingly holds the highest rank in all the census years both \\nfor level of urbanization and share of national urban population  (Figure 9.3) . On the other hand, the rank of \\nSylhet Division was the lowes t for the share of national urban population while the rank of Rangpur \\nDivision was the lowest for level of urbanization ( per cent  of population urban).  \\nFigure 9.3:   Urbanization Level and Share of National Urban Population by Division   \\n \\n   Source: BBS: Population Census 2011 -Urban Area Report (2015)  \\n0246810Percent Growth\\nPeriodTotal Population Growth Urban Population Growth\\n0.005.0010.0015.0020.0025.0030.0035.0040.0045.0050.00\\nBarisal Chittagong Dhaka Rajshahi Khulna Rangpur SylhetPercent of Urban Population\\nDivision\\nUrbanization Level Share of National Urban Population  \\n \\n519 \\n 9.3.2 Number and Size of Urban Centres: Spatial and Temporal Trends  \\nAccording to the population census of 2011 there were 506 urban centres in the country. The distribution \\nof these centres by population size  class is presented in figure 9.4. Nearly half (47.43%) of these centres \\nare small each having a population of less than 25,000. These centres serve the surrounding rural areas as \\nservice centres. Proper development of these centres is  very important from the perspective of rural \\ndevelopment. 222 urban cen tres are larger than these centres but smaller than the centres having one \\nhundred thousand or more people. These are sub -regional centres and offer higher level functions compared \\nto the smaller centres s erving surrounding rural areas. Regional centres are those having one hundred \\nthousand or more but less than five hundred thousand people. Some of these are industrial cities and other \\noffer opportunities for industrial development because of agglomeration  and urbanization economies.  \\nOne significant feature of urbanization in Bangladesh is that urban population is increasing at different rates \\nin different urban centres . A considerable proportion of urban population lives in district towns and \\nPourashavas ( Municipalities) in Bangladesh. According to population census report of 2011, Dhaka \\nMetropolitan Area had a total population of 14.17 million comprising 33.78% of total urban population. \\nNext in the hierarchy, Chattogram SMA had 3.72 million or 8.88% of th e total, followed by Khulna SMA \\nwith a total population of 1.041 million or 2.49% of total and Rajshahi SMA with a total population of a \\n0.68 million or 1.62% of the total urban population. Thus, four Metropolitan Areas accounted for 46.78% \\nof the total ur ban population.  \\nFigure 9.4: Distribution of Urban Centres  by Size Class  \\n \\n        Source: BBS  Population Census 2011 -Urban Area Report (2015)  \\n9.3.3 Primacy of Dhaka  \\nDhaka, the primate city of Bangladesh, accounts for about 12 per cent  of the total populat ion and 32 per \\ncent of the urban population of the country at present (Table 9.1). The population of the city is about 4 times \\nthe population of the second largest city, Chattogram. Dhaka’s primacy, by all counts, has been on the rise \\nin Bangladesh, in the  last 40 years. In fact, population of Dhaka has multiplied almost 6 times during this \\n0 100 200 300 400 500 60050,00,000 and Over10,00,000 -…5,00,000 - 9,99,9991,00,000 –4,99,99950,000 –99,99925,000 –49,999Under 25,000Total\\n1223963159240506\\n7.7112.4531.4247.43100\\nNumber of Urban CentresSize Class in Terms of PopulationPercent of Urban Centres Number of Urban Centers  \\n \\n520 \\n 40-year period. About 80 per cent of the garments industry in Bangladesh is located in and around Dhaka. \\nIn absolute numbers, Dhaka City is projected to reach 27.4 milli on by 2030, an increase of 86 per cent  over \\nthe population in 2011.  \\nTable 9.1: Primacy of Dhaka City in Different Years  \\nYear  Population \\n(million)  Per cent  of Urban \\nPopulation  Per cent  of Total \\nPopulation  Dhaka’s Population as a Multiple \\nof Second Largest C ity’s \\nPopulation  \\n1981  03.44  25.42  03.94  2.47 \\n1991  06.84  30.46  06.13  2.91 \\n2001  09.67  34.47  08.20  3.33 \\n2011  14.17  33.78  09.44  3.80 \\n2018  19.57  32.11  11.76  4.06 \\nSource: Population Census Reports (BBS); World Cities Report -2018 (UN)  \\nTable 9.2 presents the  characteristics of the primate city in selected Asian countries including Bangladesh. \\nIt is interesting to note that the degree of primacy is highest in Bangladesh compared to the primate cities \\nof other countries both in terms of share of total populatio n and total urban population. Bangladesh also has \\nthe lowest number of cities with more than one million people while there are 6 such cities in Vietnam, 14 \\nin Indonesia and 10 in Pakistan. Such concentrated urban development is taking its toll on the liveability  of \\nDhaka city. The city is afflicted with innumerable problems resulting from inadequate waste management, \\npoor drainage, air pollution, lack of access to developed land and housing, exposure to excessive noise \\nlevel, traffic congestion as well as inadequate health , nutrition  and other basic services. As the country \\naspires to become middle income country by 2030 it is of utmost importance to address these problems and \\nimprove the liveability  index of the city  \\nTable 9.2: Size of Primate City and Urban Development in Selected Asian Countries  \\nCountry  Population  \\n(millions)  Urban \\nPopulation Share \\nof Primate City \\n(%) Share of the \\nPrimate City  \\nin Population \\n(%) Share of Population \\nin other cities with \\nmore than 1 million \\npeople (%)  Number of \\nCities with  \\nmore than a \\nmillion people  \\nBangladesh  163.0  32.11  11.76  3.5 3 \\nChina  1378.7  3.1 1.8 23.4 102 \\nIndia  1324.2  6.0 2.0 12.9 54 \\nIndonesia  261.1  7.4 4.0 6.6 14 \\nPakistan  193.2  22.6 8.9 13.2 10 \\nVietnam  92.7 23.2 8.1 6.6 6 \\nSource : World Bank database  \\n9.4 URBANI SATIO N AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  \\n9.4.1 Economic Role of Cities  \\nThe role of cities in national economic development is now well -established. Today, cities play a central \\nrole in creating national wealth, enhancing social and economic development, attracting dire ct foreign \\ninvestment and manpower, and harnessing both human and physical resources in order to achieve gains in \\nproductivity and competitiveness. A recent study has shown that 123 largest metro areas in the world \\naccounts for about one third of global ou tput with only 13 per cent  of the world’s population. These cities   \\n \\n521 \\n are located in developed as well as in developing countries. Higher urban productivity is more prominent \\nin developing countries where cities are more productive than their rural counterpar ts. Although rising \\nlevels of urbanization and rapid population growth in large cities have often been considered problematic, \\nthe fact that major cities generally have a significantly higher concentration of the nation’s economic output \\nthan its populatio n is well -founded. Dhaka city, for example, accounts for only 8.7% of the total population \\nwhile its co ntribution to GDP is about 35%.  \\nFigure 9.5: Share of National Population and GDP in Different Cities  \\n \\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI) ); Econo mic Role of Cities 2011(UNHABITAT); Economist magazine, \\nSeptember 12, 2019 , \\nCities are now the predominant hubs of economic growth and wealth creation. The lure of employment \\nopportunities existing in the cities is a reason for urban migration. In Banglade sh millions of people have \\nbenefitted from the process of urbanization as the agriculture sector is no longer able to absorb the surplus \\nlabour  force entering the economy every year. Inability of the agriculture sector to provide sufficient \\nemployment or s ufficiently high household incomes to cope with a growing number of dependents can \\nencourage people to seek employment outside agriculture. In the case of Bangladesh, rural -to-urban \\nmigration has contributed to more than 40 per cent  of the change in urban population.  \\nHousehold income is found to be much higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Report of the household \\nincome and expenditure survey, 2016 (BBS, 2017) indicated that monthly income per household in urban \\nareas was about 70% higher than the ho usehold income in rural areas. Cities also offer other advantages \\nthat are important for achieving sustainable development. Higher population density associated with \\nurbanization provides an opportunity for governments to deliver basic services such as wat er and sanitation \\nmore cost -effectively to greater numbers of people.  \\nCities not only offer various types of advantages to the city dwellers, but also facilitate country -wide \\ndevelopment. As urban centres  prosper, they provide new markets and increased dem and for goods \\nproduced elsewhere in the country. Also, a portion of urban earnings are often cycled back to the \\ncountryside by way of remittances. Further, the gains in human capital and new technologies, while initiated \\nin urban areas, often spread countr ywide. Thus, urbanization can be a driver for national growth reaching all areas.  \\n19.563.22.96.346.932.720.310.12034.510.6\\n10.532.51.422018.37.76.498.73.6\\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120Sao PauloBuenos AiresShanghaiMumbaiManilaCairoCape TownJakartaNairobiDhakaChittagong\\nPERCENTAGE SHARECity\\nShare of National GDP\\n Share of National Population  \\n \\n522 \\n 9.4.2 Economies of Agglomeration and Urbani sation  \\nHigh concentration of national economic production in urban areas is usually explained in terms of \\nlocalization and urbaniza tion economies (also known as agglomeration economies). Localization \\neconomies arise from many firms in the same industry locating close to each other. There are three sources \\nof localization economies: the first is the benefit of labour  pooling which is t he accessibility that firms have \\nto a variety of skilled labourers , which in turn provides employment opportunity for the labourers . The \\nsecond benefit is the development of industries due to the increasing returns to scale in intermediate inputs \\nfor a pro duct and the third source is the relative ease of communication, supplies, labourers  and innovative \\nideas due to the proximity among firms. Urbanization economies, on the other hand refer to a dvantages \\ngained from an urban location. These include proximity  to a market, labour supply, good communications, \\nand financial and commercial services such as auditing, advertising, investment, industrial cleaning, and \\nmaintenance. Larger cities have a greater comparative advantage  than small ones. The bigger the city the \\nmore likely is the match between specific demands and supplies.  \\nIn Bangladesh, Dhaka alone accounts for 80 per cent  of the garments industry. The proportion of people \\nengaged  in non -agricultural employment in Dhaka Metropolitan Area or Greater Dhaka is much higher \\ncompared to the rest of the country or the nation as a whole (Figure 9.6). In Dhaka Metropolitan Area, for \\nexample, industrial and service employment accounts for ab out 34% and 60% of the total employment \\nrespectively while in the country as a whole only 20.4% of the employed people are engaged in industrial \\nsector and 39% are employed in the service sector. Such percentages are even lower outside Dhaka (whole \\ncountry  excluding Dhaka). It is very likely that the localization and urbanization economies were mainly \\nresponsible for the agglomeration of activities in these major urban centres  of the country  \\nFigure 9.6: Share of Employment by Sectors  \\n        \\n        Source : Ahmed Ahsan (2019): “Dhaka centric -growth: At what cost?” in Policy Insight, November 2019, PRI, Dhaka  \\n 40.646.48.85.9\\n20.417.238.234.1\\n3936.45360.1\\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120NationalOutside DhakaGreater DhakaDhaka Metro Area\\nShare of Employment (%)Spatial LevelAgriculture Industry Service  \\n \\n523 \\n 9.4.3 City Competitiveness  \\nAs the cities are now considered as engines of economic growth, countries are now striving hard to make \\ntheir cities compet itive to attract investment and create jobs that help reduce poverty and unemployment. \\nMany developing cities have been able to do so by focusing on strategies to achieve higher productivity, \\ngreater capital intensity, higher levels of human capital, and a  greater density of hard and soft infrastructure. \\nFor example, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bangalore (India) have been able to make their economies \\nglobally competitive by moving away from an emphasis on low -cost infrastructure, low labour  costs, and \\nlow tax es, toward fostering growth in high value -added industry clusters using skilled workers, advanced \\nstrategic infrastructure and innovation.  \\nA 2011 study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) assessed the competitiveness of top 10 cities in \\nBangladesh —Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Barisal, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Bog ura, and \\nCumilla. Assessment of competitiveness was based on six key drivers —the cost of doing business, the \\ndynamics of the local economy, the availability of human resources and train ing, the availability of \\ninfrastructure, the government’s responsiveness to business needs, and the quality of life —were used in the \\ncompleteness  assessment. Each driver had several attributes, and each attribute had a number of indicators. \\nDhaka emerged a s the most competitive city in Bangladesh with a total score of 7.31 out of 10 which was \\nnot unusual given its population size as well as its role as the most important administrative, commercial \\nand industrial centre in the country. Chattogram, Sylhet, an d Cumilla had the next -highest scores. Six of \\nthe 10 cities were not competitive nationally (their index scores are below 5). These cities produce mostly \\nfor local consumption. Chattogram, Sylhet, and C umilla are considered competitive nationally, but they  \\nhave a long way to go before they can have more export -oriented, and internationally competitive, \\neconomies. None of the cities studied are internationally competitive (index score of more than 7.5), \\nalthough Dhaka is competitive internationally in some s ectors, mainly in textiles and garments.  \\n9.5 MAJOR ISSUES AND CHALLENGES OF URBANI SATION  \\n9.5.1 Urban Environment  \\nUrban environmental problems are complex, multidimensional, and interactive. The adverse environmental \\nconditions resulting from inadequate waste management, poor drainage, air pollution, lack of access to safe \\ndrinking water and sanitation, exposure to excessive noise levels, as well as inadequate health and nutrition \\nservices, exert  a heavy toll on the quality of life. The declining quality of the  urban environment results in \\nthe poor health and safety of urban residents, particularly the urban poor. It also causes irreparable damage \\nto natural ecosystems in cities and surrounding areas. Dhaka is one of Asia\\'s fastest growing cities, with a \\npopulat ion currently around 19 million. With some 400,000 new residents arriving each year from rural \\nareas seeking a better life, Dhaka is straining under the pressure of its rapidly swelling population. The \\ncity’s environment is already threatened as a conseque nce of its expanding population. In 2015 these factors \\nwere responsible for about 80,000 deaths and about 2.6 million disability adjusted life years or DALYs \\n(number of years lost due to ill -health, disability or early death) in urban areas of the country.  In Dhaka \\ncorresponding figures were 18,000 and 578,000 (Table 9.3). The economic costs associated with death and \\ndisease or disability estimated at US$1.40 billion in all urban areas of Bangladesh, and at US$310 million \\nin Dhaka alone. This is equivalent to 0.7 per cent  and 0.2 per cent  of Bangladesh’s 2015 national GDP, \\nrespectively. If broader welfare impacts of mortality are taken into account, then the estimated economic   \\n \\n524 \\n impact stands at US$6.52 billion in urban Bangladesh and US$1.44 billion in Dhaka alone, which are \\nequivalent to 3.4 per cent  and 0.7 per cent  of the 2015 national GDP, respectively.  \\nThe declining quality of the urban environment also causes irreparable damage to natural ecosystems in \\ncities and surrounding areas. With some 400,000 new residents arriving each year from rural areas seeking \\na better life, Dhaka is straining under the pressure of its rapidly swelling population. The city’s environment \\nis already threatened as a consequence of its expanding population. Air pollution is a maj or environmental \\nproblem in urban areas, especially, the big cities like Dhaka and Chattogram. To address the air pollution \\nissues, it is important to know the possible sources, locations and their strengths, so actions can be taken \\nthat can effectively im prove air quality.  \\nTable 9.3: Estimated Cost of Mortality in Urban Bangladesh and Greater Dhaka (US$ Billion) and \\nNational GDP Equivalences  \\n Urban Bangladesh  Greater Dhaka  \\nWelfare Loss  Forgone Output  Welfare Loss  Forgone Output  \\nAmount  GDP \\nequiv.

Ever increasing land price has also contributed to the deterioration \\nof housing situation as the land prices have driven the poor households out of the formal land markets and \\nforced them into the informal land markets which are characterized by slums and squatter settlements. The \\nurban land market which directly affects the urban environment and quality of urban life suffers from many \\ndistortions due to lack of proper land planning, application of zoning laws, violation of building permits \\nand inadequate infrastructure and services, thus leading  to unplanned or ribbon development of land in the \\nurban periphery.  \\nRapid growth of urban population and consequent demand for land and housing has  made the situation even \\nworse, particularly in big citi es. Very few households have access to  land and credit facilities. The situation \\nis particularly worse for the lower income group and the poor who live on marginal settlements built by \\nsmall land developers or by the occupants themselves without any securi ty of tenure. Due to lack of tenure, \\nthe poor cannot meet the need for guarantees of loan repayment. This puts most conventional sources of \\ncredit for housing construction out of the rich of the poor resulting in lower level of housing investment. \\nThis led  to overcrowding, lower quality of housing units and the proliferation of slums and squatter \\nsettlements.   \\nHousing deficit in urban areas was estimated to be about 0.91 million units in 1991 which increased to \\nabout 4.6 million units in 2010 (National Hou sing Policy, 2017). Based on various studies, the National \\nHousing Policy, 2017 indicated that by 2021 the deficit would be around 8.5 million housing units (Figure \\n9.8). This dismal housing scenario has also been a major factor contributing to extreme hom elessness in \\nurban areas.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n526 \\n Figure 9.8: Urban Housing Deficit  \\n \\n  Source: National Housing Policy, 2017  \\nApart from the existing huge shortage in housing stock, the majority of the dwelling units is structurally \\nvery poor, lack services and utilities, and built without proper planning. According to Household Income \\nand Expenditure Survey, 2016 (BBS, 2017), only 25.73 per cent  of the houses in urban areas in 2016 were \\npucca (made of brick/cement) compared to 31.04 per cent  semi -pucca and 41.77 per cent  kutch a (Table \\n9.4). However, proportion of pucca and semi -pucca structures increased from 2001 while there was a \\ndecline in the proportion of kutcha structures and jhupries indicating improvement in the economic \\ncondition of the people.  \\nTable 9.4: Per cent  of Households by Structure Type  \\nType of Structure  2001  2010  2016  \\nJhuprie (Thatched house)  \\n 7.58 1.85 1.46 \\nKutcha (No cement/concrete used)  \\n 47.15  41.56  41.77  \\nSemi pucca (Only wall made of cement/concrete)  23.26  27.88  31.04  \\nPucca (Roof and wall made of cem ent/concrete)  22.01  28.71  25.73  \\nTotal  100.00  100.00  100.00  \\nSource: HIES 2010 and HIES 2016  \\n9.5.3 Basic Urban Services  \\nAmong the most important basic service for both the urban and rural population  is access to water, sanitation \\nand hygiene (WASH) facilit ies.  The importance of WASH has grown in the context of the on-going  Covid -\\n19 pandemic in view of its important role in preventing the spread of the covid virus.  Significant progress \\nhas been made in the WASH sector under the Seventh Plan in water supply , sanitation at the household, \\nschool and healthcare facility levels.   \\nAs regard household water  access , Bangladesh is in good standing in terms of drinking water coverage. As \\nof 2017, 97% of the population had access to at least basic water (basic and ab ove). This compares \\nfavourably with other countries in the region, with India and Sri Lanka having 93% and 89% basic access, 0.95 1.134.608.5020.8728.8143.4360.00\\n0.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.00\\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025Million\\nYearHousing Deficit in Urban Areas (Million units) Total Urban Population (Million)  \\n \\n527 \\n respectively. Of the 97% access to at least basic water, safely managed services which are  the topmost \\nservice ladder accounted for  55%. However, more recent data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey \\n(MICS) 2019 show that while the proportion using at least basic water has increased to 98.5%, the share of \\nsafely managed services has regressed to 47.9%. Figure 9.9 illustrates the  progress household water.  \\nFigure 9.9: Progress in Household W ater Access  \\n \\n                               Source: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP), MICS  \\nThere has also been good progress with WASH in schools in Bangladesh. As of 2019, basic and limited \\nwater coverage accounted for 82.17% and 9.9% respectively, which combined results in improved water \\ncoverage of 92.07%. Improved sanitation coverage is 100% in schools, although 65% of schools have \\ngender -segregated usable toilets. 50% of all schoo ls have functional hand washing  facilities with soap and \\nwater available to all. On average, there is one functional, improved, unlocked toilet for every 113 students.  \\nAccording to the National Hygiene Survey 2018, an improved source of water for general uses such as \\ncleaning, bathing, and washing, was available in all health facilities. However, 77% had an improved, \\nfunctional water source with a concrete platform and no water logging . Many local healthcare facilities rely \\non tube wells  for water access. Almost all healthcare facilities have improved sanitation and hand washing  \\nfacilities, although only one in four healthcare facilities provide separate toilets for females. 11% of \\nhealthcare facilities have basic waste management services. (JMP Global Base line Report, 2019). GoB has \\ndeveloped a WASH Guideline for Community Clinics in 2019 to ensure better operation and maintenance. \\nThe Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) is also preparing a WASH Strategy for healthcare \\nfacilities.  \\nThere has been good progress in expanding sanitation coverage with Bangladesh being declared free from \\nopen defecation in 2015. The proportion of households having access to at least basic sanitation stands at \\n48%. An underlying factor behind this relatively low figure i s that WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring \\nProgramme  (JMP) considers shared facilities as a lower service level (limited as opposed to basic). In \\ndensely populated urban settlements, such as slums, individual toilets for each household are not feasible \\nand shared toilets are a reality. This is illustrated by limited facilities accounting for a higher share in urban \\nareas (32%) than at the national level (23%). Limited and basic facilities, which together constitute \\nimproved facilities, thus accounted for 71% of the  population as of 2017. However, there has been good \\nprogress in increasing the coverage of improved facilities as shown in Figure 9.10. As of 2019, use of \\n  \\n \\n528 \\n improved facilities had increased to 84.6%, of which 64.4% was for basic services. Due to lack of da ta, the \\nJMP does not report national figures for safely managed sanitation, although MICS 2019 show that 90.7% \\nof households with improved on -site sanitation facilities (facilities not connected to sewer) have safe \\ndisposal of excreta.  \\nFigure 9.10: Overall  Access to Improved Sanitation Facilities (including shared)  \\n \\n      Source: MICS  2019  \\nProgress also continues to be made in access to hygiene facilities: 35% of the population had access to basic \\nfacilities with soap and water, while 54% had access to lim ited facilities according to JMP figures of 2017. \\nThe National Hygiene Survey 2018, which provides more recent figures, reports that 61%,  had access to \\nhand washing facilities with soap and water within 30 feet from toilets. These are great steps towards \\ncovering all population under improved sanitation. However, much remains to be done in bringing all \\npeople under improved sanitation.  \\nUrban Water Supply  \\nIn 1990 nearly 81% of the urban population had access to improved water. By 2015 about 99% of the urban  \\npopulation were covered by improved water supply and 38% of them had access to piped water (Table 9.5). \\nMajority of the people (about 60%) in urban areas, however, still use tube well as their main source of \\ndrinking water (BBS, 2017).  \\nTable 9.5: Water Su pply Coverage  \\nYear  Total \\nImproved (%)  Piped onto \\nPremises (%)  Other \\nImproved (%)  Other \\nUnimproved (%)  Surface Water \\n(%) \\n1990  81 23 58 17 2 \\n1995  82 25 57 16 2 \\n2000  83 27 56 16 1 \\n2005  84 29 55 15 1 \\n2010  85 31 54 15 0 \\n2012  86 32 54 14 0 \\n2015  99 38 61 01 0 \\nSource: JMP (Joint Monitoring Program), 2014 and 2017, WHO & UNICEF, Progress of Drinking Water & Sanitation  \\n  \\n \\n529 \\n The overall urban situation with respect to water supply does not necessarily mean that all the urban \\nresidents have equal access to improved  water. Figure 9. 11 presents data on coverage of population by \\npiped water supply  in 7 city corporations and 31 Paurashavas  grouped according to population sizes. In \\ncities with one million or more people, 64% of the population get piped water on an averag e while in \\npourashavas with less than 100 thousand people coverage of population by piped water is only 37% on an \\naverage. Thus, the supply of piped water at the Pourashava level is quite unsatisfactory. Water supply \\nsituation is unsatisfactory in slums an d squatter settlements. Despite the fact that the poor are supposed to \\nbenefit most from Government services, this is not always the case. The quantity of water the poor get is \\nquite insufficient and far below the GOB basic service level  standard  for water  supply of 20 litres per capita \\nper day.  With groundwater extraction reaching unsustainable levels, especially in urban areas and where \\ninfiltration of pollutants is also heightened, groundwater monitoring and improved management of surface \\nwater is urgent ly needed.  \\nUrban Sanitation and Solid Waste Disposal  \\nThe use of sanitary toilet facilities in urban areas increased quite significantly during the last three decades. \\nFrom Table 9.6 , it is observed that there has b een an increasing trend in the use of sanitary toilet facilities \\nsince 1981. In 1981, 32.4% of urban households used sanitary toilets which increased to 82.12% in 2016.  \\nFigure 9. 11: Average Coverage by Piped Water (% of Population)  \\n \\n         Source: Worl d Bank (WSP ), 2014; Bangladesh Delta Plan (2016)  \\nTable 9.6: Per cent  of Urban Households with Sanitary Facility  \\nYear  Toilet Facilities  \\nSanitary  Other  None  \\n1981  32.4 54.5 13.2 \\n1991  56.2 30.4 13.3 \\n2001  67.3 25.34  7.36 \\n2005  79.8 18.5 1.00 \\n2010  76.12  23.11 0.77 \\n2016  82.12  16.94  0.94 \\nSource: BBS, 2005a; HIES (BBS), 2010 and 2016  \\n020406080\\nLess than\\n100100  to  299 300  to  999 1000 and\\nMoreTotal3751\\n4064\\n42% of Population Covered by \\nPiped Water\\nPopulation Size of Cities (Thousand)  \\n \\n530 \\n Although a high proportion of population (nearly 85%) use some form of improved sanitation facility, \\nconnection to a sewer system is entirely an urban phenomenon, and particular ly concentrated in Dhaka, \\nwhere there is a sewerage connection of 22%. However, only 2% of the faecal sludge is effectively treated, \\nand the rest find their way to the environment through leakage and ineffective treatment.  \\nGiven the limited coverage of se wers, the vast majority of the population using on -site improved sanitation \\nfacilities use some form of pit latrines connected to a septic tank where the sludge accumulates. Increasing \\npopulation density and increasing level s of water use lead  to overloadi ng of septic tanks which discharge \\nlarge volumes of untreated effluent directly into the environment, either through dysfunctional pathways or \\nby deliberate discharge to surface drains. It is common for many households to connect pour -flush toilets \\ndirectl y to drains without any form of on -site containment. Currently, local authorities have limited \\narrangements for collection from septic tanks at household levels. Households using on -site sanitation with \\nadequate containment usually depend on manual emptyin g services. The faecal sludge collected by the pit \\nemptiers is often disposed directly into the environment, and only a fraction of faecal sludge collected is \\nsafely managed due to lack of disposal sites. Poor faecal sludge management (FSM) is thus a publi c health \\nand environmental hazard.  \\nSolid Waste Management  \\nThe impact of urbanization is felt more intensely in the area of waste generation in cities and towns of the \\ncountry. Generation of solid waste in urban areas of Bangladesh has been increasing comm ensurate with \\nincrease in urban population. Table 9.7 shows the growth in solid waste generation in Bangladesh since \\n1991. It is quite clear that generation of solid waste in urban areas of Bangladesh has been increasing \\ncommensurate with increase in urban  population despite the fact that the amount of solid waste generated \\nper capita per day is lower compared to developed countries.  \\nTable 9.7: Growth in Solid Waste Generation in Bangladesh since 1991  \\nYear  Total Urban \\nPopulation  Urban Population \\n(in per cen t) Waste Generation  \\n(kg/cap/day)  Total Waste \\nGeneration  \\n(tonne/day)  \\n1991  20872204  20.15  0.31 6493  \\n2001  28808477  23.39  0.40 11695  \\n2005  \\n \\n 32765516  25.08  0.40 13330  \\n 2014  41940000  29.00  0.56 23688  \\n2025 (projected)  78440000  40.00  0.60 47000  \\nSource: Waste  Concern: Bangladesh Waste Database 2014  \\nCollection and disposal of huge quantities of solid waste generated daily in large urban areas is indeed a \\ndaunting task for the urban local governments. Waste collection efficiency defined as the proportion of \\ngenerated waste collected and transported to disposal site, is generally low and varies widely across cities \\n(Figure 9.1 2). A part of this waste either remains in the streets or on nearly open ground. Some of the waste \\nflows to the open drains and blocks the normal drainage flow. As a result, water logging sometimes disrupts \\nthe normal city life for days during monsoon.  The serious health hazard posed by this situation is of major \\nconcern.  \\n   \\n \\n531 \\n Figure 9.1 2: Waste Collection Efficiency of City Corporations  \\n \\n \\nSource: CEGIS: Baseline Survey on Waste Generation 2013;  BIGD State of  Cities: Solid Waste Management  in Dhaka \\nCity, 2015; Khulna  City Corporation, 2020  \\nUrban Transportation  \\nRapid urbanization in Bangladesh during the last few decades led to manifold increase s in the number of \\nmotorized and non -motorized vehicles on city streets. Continuous and rapid increase in the number of \\nprivate passenger cars is considered primarily responsible for congestion on urban roads (Figure 9.1 3). Cars \\ncause problems not only whe n they are moving, they also require an inordinate amount of space for parking. \\nThe problem is most acute in Dhaka where growth of car ownership has exploded.  For example, p rivate \\ncar ownership in Dhaka has increased from 5.85 vehicles per 10,000 persons in 1971 to 34.6 in 1992, an \\nincrease of about 490 per cent . By 2011 car ownership reached 160 per 10,000 persons and in 2017 the \\nestimated number of cars per 10,000 persons was around 200, indicating  near exponential increase in the \\nnumber of cars on the r oads Although private cars account for a small proportion of total number of trips \\nin the city, they occupy much larger road space. Car is the most inefficient transport mode in terms of \\nnumber of passengers and occupation of road space.  \\nRoad transportatio n dominates the transport systems in the country which provides passenger services and \\ntransportation of commodities. In urban areas also road transport system is the main means for carrying \\npassengers and commodities. Rail and water transport systems are mainly used by commuters and for \\ntransporting commodities between urban areas.  \\nFigure 9.1 3 represents the level of service of roads in six city corporations. Level of service (LOS) is defined \\nas meter per person which is the most satisfactory condition in  Borishal  and is in worst situation in \\nChattogram. If all types of roads are considered best level of service is found in Barisal followed by Sylhet, \\nRajshahi, Khulna, Dhaka and Chattogram. Chattogram performs worst both in terms of paved roads and all \\ntypes of roads probably due to physical characteristics of the city. Among the six city corporations, Dhaka \\n01020304050607080\\nGazipur Narayanganj Sylhet Chittagong Khulna Rajshahi Dhaka (North\\nand South)50.84\\n44.88 44.8446.7250.0074.2576.14% of Waste Collected and Disposed\\nCity Corporations  \\n \\n532 \\n is confronted with the most serious transportation problems. The transport sector of the city is comprised \\nof many different modes of travel -both motor ized and non -motorized -often using the same road space – \\nresulting in a high level of operational disorder that  significantly diminishes the efficiency and effectiveness \\nof the existing transport uses.  \\nThe capital city Dhaka receives most attention from t he policy makers in terms of addressing its \\ntransportation problems while major secondary cities like Chattogr am, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Cu milla, \\nBogra and Mymensingh  do not receive proper attention despite the fact that these cities also face significa nt \\ntransportation problems. In recent years CNG driven and battery -operated auto -rickshaws have flooded the \\ncity streets in these urban areas causing severe traffic congestion. Non -motorised transport modes such as \\nwalking, rickshaws and bicycles are also used by a significant percentage of people in  S these cities.  \\nFigure 9.1 3: Level of Service of Roads in Six City Corporations  \\n \\n        Source: City Corporations and RAJUK, 2019  \\nNon-existence of transport planning and inefficient traffic engineering resu lt in low quality traffic \\nmanagement. Public transport systems are poorly organized and there is lack of integration with non -\\nmotorized vehicles. Buses are in short supply and there is inadequate rail system to handle day -to-day \\ncommuter traffic. Moreover,  the growing dependence on private vehicles for intra -metropolitan trips is \\ncurrently a crucial component in the debate on sustainable urban development, given the economic, social \\nand environmental impact for which it is responsible. Considering all these  factors, it has become a \\nchallenging task for the government as well as transport planners and engineers to cater the demand of \\nmobility for the ever-increasing  urban population in a more sustainable way.  \\nUrban Poverty  \\nHousehold income is found to be much  higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Report of the household \\nincome and expenditure survey, 2016 (BBS, 2017) indicated that monthly income per household in urban \\nareas was about 70% higher than the household income in rural areas. Consequently, the incidence of \\npoverty is also higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Using the upper poverty line, the BBS estimated 1.321\\n0.3370.4940.6280.7691.202\\n0.5171.539\\n0.3780.978 1.0041.271.314\\n0.922\\nBARISAL CHITTAGONG DHAKA KHULNA RAJSHAHI SYLHET TOTALMetre per Per Person\\nCity Corporation/Metropolitan AreaLevel of Service- Metalled Road (metre/ person) Level of Service- Total Road (metre/ person)  \\n \\n533 \\n the Head Count Rate (HCR) of incidence of poverty as 48.9% at national level, 52.3% in rural areas and \\n35.2% in urban areas (Figure 9.1 5) in 2000.

Level of extreme \\npoverty estimated on the basis of lower poverty line is also found to be much higher in rural areas. In 2016 \\nproportion of people living below lower poverty line (extreme poor) was about 50% higher in rural areas \\nthan in urban area s (Figure 9.1 4). \\nFigure 9.1 4: Poverty Level (%) by Upper and Lower Poverty Lines in Different Years  \\n \\n Source: BBS (HIES 2005 and 2010 and 2016)  \\nOne of the major causes of rapid urbanization in Bangladesh during the last few decades is the migration \\nof rur al people to urban areas. A significant percentage of these people have been forced to leave their \\nhomes in rural areas due to poverty. Rapid increase in urban population has contributed to the skyrocketing \\nof land prices in urban areas. This has made it e xtremely difficult for the urban poor to get access to serviced \\nland. Most of the urban poor live in slums and squatter settlements characterized by substandard living \\nconditions. Slums and squatter settlements are found in all major cities in Bangladesh a lthough their \\nconcentrations may vary depending on the size of cities. The largest concentrations are found in Dhaka \\nfollowed by Chattogram, Khulna and Rajshahi. Secondary cities or district towns also have significant \\nconcentrations of slums and squatter settlements.  \\nThe urban poor are especially vulnerable to economic shocks as indicated by the adverse effects of COVID -\\n19 (See Chapter 4, Part 1) . They lack the access to services, safety nets, civil protections, and political \\nrepresentation enjoyed by upp er-income groups. Urban living conditions, especially in large and fast -\\ngrowing cities, are deteriorating relative to those in smaller towns. These changes are raising questions \\nregarding conventional views of urban advantage and creating a potential for i ncreasing social problems.  48.9\\n40\\n31.5\\n24.334.3\\n25.1\\n17.6\\n12.952.3\\n43.8\\n35.2\\n26.437.9\\n28.6\\n21.1\\n14.935.2\\n28.4\\n21.3\\n18.920\\n14.6\\n7.7 7.6\\n0102030405060\\n2000 2005 2010 2016 2000 2005 2010 2016\\nUpper Poverty Line Lower Poverty LinePoverty Level (%)\\nYearNational Rural Urban  \\n \\n534 \\n 9.5.4 Climate Change and Disaster Management in Urban Areas  \\nFlooding and water -logging have become a major problem of urban areas, especially the big cities. The \\nproblem becomes quite serious during annual monsoon with widespread  and lengthy disruption of roads, \\ntelecommunications, electricity supply and water supply. Recurrent floods and water logging are the major \\nnatural events that create havoc and disrupt socio -economic life of the cities. With the changing climate the \\nintens ity of rainfall has also increased in recent years and extreme events such as floods, drainage \\ncongestions, and water logging have become a regular occurrence in the rainy season. The situation is likely \\nto deteriorate further with increased urbanization a ccompanied by intense industrial and commercial \\nactivities, increases in built -up areas and consequent loss of green areas and wetlands.  \\nDhaka was declared as the most vulnerable megacity to climate change by the World Wide Fund for Nature \\n(WWF) in 2009. This vulnerability has not changed much over the years. The intensity and pace of present \\nand future climate changes induced by continuous emission of greenhouse gas will be a major challenge \\nfor the city as the frequency and intensity of flooding are likel y to increase. This will threaten the critical \\ninfrastructure that supplies the city dwellers with essential services such as electricity, water, waste disposal, \\ntransportation, telecommunication etc.   \\nThere are two types of city inundation namely urban f loods and river floods. Urban floods are classified as \\nthe city inundation caused by drainage congestion and water logging.  And river floods are classified as the \\ncity inundation caused by river floods. Urban flooding in the built areas of Dhaka city is a  major concern \\nand a matter of serious discussion among the city dwellers. It causes unbearable sufferings for the people \\nby creating difficult situation for traffic movement as well as unhygienic environment that has long lasting   \\nconsequences.  Followin g are the main reasons for urban flooding in different cities including Dhaka:  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase in covered areas causing higher rainfall run -off volume;  \\n\\uf0b7 Unplanned and uncoordinated development of the city;  \\n\\uf0b7 Continuous filling of wetlands for expansion of the cit y both by the public sector and private \\norganizations;  \\n\\uf0b7 Unauthorized and illegal occupation and destruction of natural drainage system and      retention \\nbasins;  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate storm water drainage facilities;  \\n\\uf0b7 Clogging of drainage channels and sewer lines du e to indiscriminate dumping of solid wastes and \\ninadequate cleaning of sewers, catch pits, et c.; and  \\n\\uf0b7 High water level in the peripheral river system.  \\nThe disappearance of the natural drainage system is one of the main causes for water logging. Rapid \\npopu lation growth and unplanned development, unplanned land filling to develop new residential areas, \\nuncontrolled and haphazard disposal of solid wastes and garbage into the existing drainage system, and \\nencroachment on lakes, khals/canals and rivers with una uthorized construction are the main activities that \\ncan be linked to the disappearance of natural drainage system.  \\nPlanning, construction and maintenance of drainage system in a city may be shared by a number of agencies. \\nIn Dhaka, for example, Development  and maintenance of drainage system are shared by DWASA, DNCC, \\nDSCC, BWDB, RAJUK and Cantonment Board. Lack of capacity and poor coordination among these   \\n \\n535 \\n agencies are often cited as one of the major reasons for poor performance of Dhaka’s drainage system. \\nDhaka’s two DCCs are responsible for development and maintenance of the surface drains and roadside \\ninlets. DWASA, on the other hand, is responsible for development and maintenance of the underground \\nstorm -water drainage system. As the performances of surf ace drains and storm -water drains are dependent \\non each other, strong coordination among these authorities is essential.  \\nIn Chattogram also governance of drainage systems does not belong to any particular authority. Several \\nauthoritative bodies are respons ible for managing the drainage system of the city. The core responsibility \\nfor storm water drainage and sewerage belongs to CWASA. However, CWASA has neither developed any \\nsewerage system nor storm water drainage infrastructure till date. CCC is mainly wor king on the local and \\ntertiary drainage development and construction and is also responsible to keep the drains clean. CDA\\'s role \\nis to incorporate drains in land -use and structural plans and allot space in city designs. The Bangladesh \\nWater Development Bo ard (BWDB), another statutory body, is responsible to plan the flood management \\nof CCC and they are both involved in linking embankment with the drainage system. Lack of capacity and \\ncoordination among these authorities are also cited as one of the major r easons for poor performance of the \\ndrainage system in Chattogram.  \\nApart from institutional coordination, there is also lack of involvement of civil society – local community, \\nNGOs, private sector and academia in the planning, development and management of the drainage systems. \\nThe institutional arrangements are we ak and the management organization lacks incentives for giving better \\noutputs. The organizations do not as  customer driven organizations and lack a holistic view of their \\nmanagement.  \\n9.6 PLANNING, DEVE LOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF URBAN AREAS: \\nMAJOR CHALLENGES  \\n9.6.1 Present System of Urban Governance and Management  \\nAt present urban development activities in Bangladesh are carried out mostly by national government \\norganizations. There are at least eighteen m ain ministries and 42 organizations which are involved in the \\ndevelopment of urban areas. National level agencies provide services to different urban areas including city \\ncorporations, Paurashavas  and other urban centres as part of their national responsib ilities. Some of the \\nimportant national agencies are Urban Development Directorate (UDD), National Housing Authority \\n(NHA) and the Public Works Department (PWD) under the Ministry of Housing & Public Works, the \\nDepartment of public Health Engineering (DPHE ) and the Local Government Engineering Department \\nunder the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, the Roads and Highways \\nDepartment under the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges  the Directorate of Environment under the \\nMinist ry of Environment , Forest and Climate Change and the Power Development Board under the Ministry \\nof Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. Other Ministries such as the Ministries of Commerce, Education, \\nFinance, Agriculture, Youth and Sports, and Water Resour ces Development are also actively involved in \\nthe process of urban development mainly through their regional and local level agencies.  \\n   \\n \\n536 \\n At the local level, City Corporations and Pourashavas function as urban local governments. All divisional \\nheadquarters a nd some larger cities such as Gazipur, Narayanganj and Cumilla have city Corporations. At \\npresent there are 1 2 city Corporations  and 335 Pourashavas. Separate planning and development \\norganizations have als o been created for the cities of Dhaka, Chattogram , Khulna, Rajshahi  and Cox’s \\nBazar. The development authorities in these cities are authorized to undertake local urban planning as well \\nas infrastructure and site development activities for housing, commercial and industrial use. The authorities \\nare also empowered to exert development control functions.  \\nTable 9.8: Hierarchy of Urban Local Governments  \\nMega City  For example: Dhaka Metropolitan Area  \\nCity Corporations at Divisional \\nHeadquarters and larger cities  Dhaka North, Dhaka South, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, \\nSylhet, Barisal, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Narayanganj, \\nGazipur and Cumilla  \\nPaurashavas (Municipalities)  Number of Paurashavas - 335 at present  \\nCategory determined on income level  Annual income level  \\nClass A Paurashavas  At least Tk. 8 Million  \\nClass B Paurashavas  Between Tk. 4 Million and 8 Million  \\nClass C Paurashavas  Between Taka 2 Million and Tk. 4 Million  \\n  Source: BBS and LGD  \\nAt some divisional Headquarters special purpose agencies have also been created that provide special \\nservices to the c ity dwellers such as the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, El ectricity Supply \\nAuthority, etc. The Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) Act, 1996 empowers the government to \\nestablish WASAs and permits WASAs to carry out works related to water supply, sewe rage and drainage \\nsystems. There are four water and sewerage authorities in Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna and Rajshahi. Dhaka \\nElectricity Supply Authority is mainly responsible for distribution of power while the gas distribution \\nauthority is responsible for d istribution of gas to the residential, commercial and industrial areas. The \\nfunctions of all these organizations are important in urban development  \\n9.6.2 Regulatory , Administrative and Fiscal Framework  for Urban Governance and Management  \\nAs discussed in so me detail in Chapter 7, t wo fundamental constraints faced by all local government \\ninstitutions (LGIs) , urban and rural, are inadequate administrative autonomy and accountability and the \\nlack of fiscal autonomy.  Bangladesh has made good progress in setting  up elected LGIs.  It has also invested \\nstrongly in LGIs to improve their service capability.  Nevertheless, the absence of administrative and fiscal \\nautonomy ha s reduced the ability to respond effectively to the growing urbanization challenge.  \\nThe PP2021  recognized the gravity of the urbanization challenge and its long -term nature.  The strategy \\ncalled for a major overhaul in the approach to urbanization.  It emphasized balanced development of many \\nurban centres instead of Dhaka -centric urbanization.  It suggested a major change in the urban governance \\nby emphasizing political, administrative and fiscal decentralization and participatory development.  It \\nsuggested improvements in land use planning and allocation.  It laid focus on improving the urban physi cal \\nenvironment.  It advocated a major and sustainable expansion in urban services through a combination of \\npublic and private investments. Taken together, this constitutes a comprehensive and balanced approach to   \\n \\n537 \\n urbanization and much different from the s trategy prevailing in FY2010. The 6FYP and the 7FYP \\ndeveloped specific actions to implement the PP2021 urbanization strategy  \\nNotwithstanding this visionary approach to urbanization, the PP2021 urban strategy and the programmes \\narticulated in the 6th and th e 7th Five Year Plans faced several constraints that reduced the implementation \\nresults. Much of the emphasis was placed on public investment support to LGIs for enhancing related \\nservices.  Thus, s ubstantial investments in urban infrastructure and service s have been made . Yet, the large \\nbacklog of unmet demand and the continued rapid growth of urbanization have outstripped those \\ninvestments. At the institutional level, solid progress  was made in implementing political decentralization \\non the basis of elect ed management of City Corporations and Municipalities (Paurashavas). But the agenda \\nfor administrative decentralization did not proceed as envisaged in the PP2021, the 6FYP and the 7FYP.  \\nThe urban LGIs  have very little mandated responsibilities with consi derable overlap with other government \\nentities.  Fiscal decentralization is yet to happen.  Consequently, urban bodies remain heavily dependent on \\nnational government funding. Own resource mobilization is very low (collectively about 0.16% of GDP), \\nwhich d oes not even meet their current expenses. Unbalanced urbanization has further accelerated as \\nDhaka’s primacy increased further between FY2010 and F2018. Urban traffic congestion has further \\nintensified , the urban slum population has grow n, and  the difficul ties in managing urban sanitation , solid \\nwaste  and drainage weaken  the urban natural environment.    \\nUrbanisation Constraints  \\nSeveral factors constrain urban development in Bangladesh. These include unclear legal mandate, \\noverlapping functions and accountab ilities, weak capacities, poor governance and weak finances.  \\nLegal Framework  \\nHowever, proper allocation of responsibilities and financing has not happened.  Only a limited number of \\nfunctions are assigned to the urban LGIs. Even so, the demarcation of resp onsibilities is unclear and \\noverlapping with other line Ministries. The governance structure in theory is democratic and is elections \\nbased, but in practice LGIs have little autonomy and are controlled by the national government. Resources \\navailable to LGI s are very limited.  There is very little financial autonomy that creates a huge dependency \\nsyndrome on the national government.  \\nConfused Overlapping Mandates  \\nThere are as many as nine specialised institutions and several line ministries providing urban se rvices with \\nlittle or no coordination, overlapping mandates, weak capacities and financial limitations. As a result, \\nservice delivery is inefficient and accountability is poor.  \\nWeak Capacities  \\nCapacities of city corporations and municipalities are weak p rimarily due to lack of financial resources. \\nCity Corporations tend to be somewhat stronger than the municipalities. But in general inadequacy of \\nresources limits ability to recruit good quality and adequate number of staff. This in turn seriously constrai ns \\nthe quantity and quality of urban services.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n538 \\n Governance Problems  \\nAlthough urban LGIs are elected local bodies, they have very limited political and administrative \\nauthorities). De facto, they basically function as extended arms of national political pa rties to which they \\nbelong. Urban LGIs that belong to the same political party as the national government tend to be favoured  \\nin terms of resource allocation. Lack of autonomy often results in favour  distribution in matters of contract \\nawards and selection  of staff. At the administrative level, there are coordination problems with national \\ngovernment staff posted at the district level.  \\nWeak Finances and Absence of Financial Autonomy  \\nPerhaps the most fundamental constraint is the inadequacy of resources ava ilable to urban LGIs and \\nassociated poor financial autonomy. Under the Legal Framework, urban LGIs can obtain resources from a \\nnumber of sources.  These include:  \\na) property tax;  \\nb) rents from markets owned by urban LGIs;  \\nc) fees from licenses issued to traders a nd non -motor vehicles;  \\nd) fees from advertisements, cinema and entertainment;  \\ne) sale of property/assets and  \\nf) grants and loans from the government.  \\nHowever, in practice, the returns are very low and resources are grossly inadequate in comparison with \\nneeds. Ot her than property tax, all other taxes are assigned to the national government. Transfers from \\nnational government to LGIs are ad -hoc and are not based on well - defined principles in the context of \\nassigned accountabilities enshrined in the legal framework . As analysed  in detail in Chapter 7, g overnment \\ntransfers account for some 61 per cent  of total urban LGI resources ; charges and fees account for 25 per \\ncent; taxes account for only 14 per cent ; and t here is no scope for market borrowing. The government b udget \\nis responsible for all transfer funding including grants and loans.  Since the urban LGIs do not have any \\ncapacity for loan servicing, these government loans stay in the books as outstanding dues.  Furthermore, \\nwhile urban LGIs have access to a major  source of tax revenue, the property tax, they do not flexibility to \\ndefine proper property values or set the appropriate tax rate without the approval of the Ministry  of Finance . \\nThe urban agenda has clearly assumed added urgency. Some high -level policy d ecisions relating to urban \\ngovernance, especially decentralization  is critical to move forward with the urban agenda. Decentralization \\nreforms must address the assignment of responsibilities with no overlaps and financial decentralization. \\nThere is conside rable good practice international experience that Bangladesh can draw on in this regard. \\nThe PP2041 has articulated a solid vision for the urban sector and identified a broad strategic framework \\nfor realizing this vision.  The 8FYP will draw on this in def ining the urban governance strategy.     \\n \\n539 \\n 9.7 PERFORMANCE OF THE URBAN SECTOR DURING 7th FIVE YEAR PLAN \\nPERIOD  \\n9.7.1 Ministry of Housing and Public Works: Recent Achievements  \\nNational Housing Authority  \\nNational Housing Authority has completed 15 (fifteen) projects  in 7th five year plan period at different \\nlocations of Bangladesh of which 7 (seven) were flat projects (849 flats) and 8 (Eight) were plot projects \\n(1605 plots). All those flats & plots have been handed over to the allottee s. Currently 15 flat & 16 plot \\nprojects (7286 flats & 2558 plots) are running to minimize acute housing problem & provide affordable \\nhousing for all. The  contribution of PWD encompasses the entire spectrum of physical and social \\ninfrastructure for national development, national security  and international relations. The main \\nresponsibilities of PWD are construction and maintenance of government buildings and establishments \\nincluding Key Point Installations (KPIs). In order to enhance the accommodation facilities of the \\ngovernment official s in Dhaka city PWD has so far implemented nine projects and handed over 3012 no. \\nof flats. As a result, total residential facilities for government officials increased from 8% to 10.8%. \\nConstruction of another 9734 flats under  17 projects is going on in D haka, Narayanganj, Chittagong and \\nNoakhali. To ensure sustainable urban development, PWD has focused on energy efficient buildings and \\nintroduced installation of solar panels, Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) and rain water harvesting in \\nseveral newly cons tructed structures. Besides two parks (12 acre) with modern facilities has been \\nconstructed in Chittagong City and another 210 acres is preserved. Therefore, office spaces measuring \\naround 2.51 lac sft, auditorium and other infrastructures have been built and upgraded during this period. \\nBesides, government office and residential facilities measuring more than 15 million square meters have \\nbeen repaired/maintained/refurbished.  \\nFor the last few years, PWD is working on disaster resilient structures and built  its capacity in this area \\nunder foreign aided project. To bring disaster resilience to the existing vulnerable buildings, PWD has \\ncompleted a project named CNCRP in cooperation with Japanese counterpart and prepared six manuals on \\nearth quake resistant ne w construction and retrofitting mechanism for strengthening old vulnerable \\nbuildings. On piloting basis those technologies has been implemented to strengthen the old risky Tejgaon \\nfire station building successfully. At present old vulnerable hospitals, off ice buildings and other important \\nstructures are being retrofitted under the supervision of PWD.  \\nDirectorate of Government Accommodation  \\nThrough e -management system, all kinds of information and services for government employees have been \\nsimplified includ ing allotment of houses in Dhaka. During the plan period (up -to 2018), 1249205 square \\nfeet new buildings have been constructed and construction areas of 23 million square meter government \\naccommodation have been repaired. Two environment friendly sewerage treatment plants have been \\nconstructed and rain water harvesting activities of five projects have been completed. One project of \\nCNCRP has been implemented for creation of human resource to ensure security of vulnerable buildings. \\nTraining Academy and Test ing Laboratory Buildings including ancillary constructions have been done and \\n4998 officers/staffs have trained in the Academy. In addition, 250 structural plans have been formulated,   \\n \\n540 \\n preservation of park/playground of 650 acres has been done and about 20k m internal connecting roads have \\nbeen built. Solar panel of 60 KW capacities power generation has been constructed as renewable energy.  \\nDepartment of Architecture  \\nDepartment of Architecture has prepared structure plans of physical infrastructure projects o f national \\nimportance under different ministries and departments, which include Construction of Residential \\nBuildings for Judges at 32 Districts project, Construction of National Board of Revenue Office Building \\nproject, Construction of IT Village at Korai l Mauza project and different disable friendly infrastructure \\nprojects.  Around 400 different t ype of a rchitectural drawing for different Ministry, Department and \\nDirectorate according to their requirements has been rendered.  \\nUrban Development Directorate  \\nComplying with the vision and mission statement of Ministry of Housing & Public Works, Urban \\nDevelopment Directorate prepared master plan for divisional towns, district towns and upazilas covering \\npaurashava and surrounding rural areas. Up to the year 2020,  UDD has prepared 28 master plans, among \\nthe 03 divisional towns and 25 upazilas including 4 district towns and 19 paurashavas within the upazilas, \\nand a total population 72, 58,014 has been brought under planned areas. As a result,  Master plan prepared \\nby UDD covered an area of 9881.45 sq km which is 6.70 per cent  of total Bangladesh.      \\nDevelopment Authorities  \\nRajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha: Detailed Area Plan (2016 -2035) for Dhaka Metropolitan \\nDevelopment Plan Area has been formulated as well as Transit  Oriented Development (TOD) is introduced \\nin DAP (2016 -2035). Rajuk has handed over 17000 residential plots and 1101 lease dead registration in this \\nperiod. Rajuk has handed over 4366 number of flat in Uttara and constructed 27 flats in a 10 storey buildin g \\nin Gulshan area. RAJUK also Completed 462.42 km road network , 60 bridges, 2 Flyovers, 4 Overpass, 2 \\nU-loops, 71 km lake, 22.39 km walkway, 10 main sewerage diversion line and other beautification and \\nsocial work under Purbachal, Uttara 3rd Phase, Jhilmil , Hatirjheel, Gulshan -Banani -Baridhara lake \\ndevelopment. Apart from these Uttara lake development, Kuril Purbachal 100 feet khal, Madani Avenue to \\nBalu river, road construction has been completed.  \\nChattogram Development Authority: Chattogram Development Au thority has allotted 3180 plots in \\nresidential areas in this period. In addition, about 50 km new roads have been built and widened under \\ndifferent projects. 1100 -meter -long Kadamtali flyover, 1331.60 -meter -long Bahadderhat Flyover & 6.18 \\nKilo Meter Muradp ur Flyover has been constructed by CDA. Another 560 -meter -long and 8.5 -meter - wide \\nRCC over -bridge has been constructed adjacent to Dewanhat Junction at Doublemooring Thana  to \\nKadamtali. Construction of 24 flats has been completed for mid -level officers at  Mehedibag Officers \\nQuarters of CDA.  \\nKhulna Development Authority: Khulna Development Authority came forward with fast track service in \\nland clearance.   Reconstruction of 7.52 km  road at S hiromoni industrial area and 730 No’s of residential \\n& commercial plots have been developed. Among those 500 No’s plots have been allotted to the people. \\nLand acquisition for “Widening & improvement of Khulna shipyard road” project has been completed.     \\n \\n541 \\n Rajshahi Development Authority: To ensure the sustainable transport infrastructure of the city RDA has \\nconstructed three road projects and added further 8.50 kilometre roads, drains and about 1.00 km four lane \\noverpass to city’s road network and drainage system as per recommendation of Rajshahi Metropolitan \\nDevelopment Pla n, 2004 -2024. For the first time in Bangladesh the concept of common duct to underground \\nthe utility services has also been implemented by these projects. These projects helped the city to reduce \\nthe city congestion problem and improve the communication be tween the northern city periphery area and \\nthe main CBD area of Rajshahi. Moreover, to improve the housing demand of the city RDA has developed \\ntwo planned residential area named \"Banalota Residential Area\" and \"Barnoi Residential Area\" and \\ndistributed abo ut 493 Nos. residential plots to the people. As targeted during the 7th five year plan the \\nRevision project of the Rajshahi Metropolitan Development Plan, 2004 -2024 has achieved its goal by \\nforming its planning and coordination cell and updating the Physic al feature data of the city.  \\nCox’s bazar Development Authority: Cox’s bazar Development Authority is the beacon of development \\nin Cox ’s bazar city. Visually pleasing sculptures, LED lights have been installed in Cox\\'s Bazar city by the \\nauthority to enhanc e the beauty, safety and security. Almost 10,000 saplings of different varieties have been \\nplanted in different areas of the authority under Greening project. Conservation project possessing fences \\nhave been installed to protect biodiversity including red crabs, turtles, dolphins  and sea creepers.   \\nHousing and Building Research Institute  \\nDuring the plan period (up -to 2018), 6 research works on house building materials and the innovation of \\ntechnology have been completed.1500 samples of construction materia ls and load bearing capacity of \\n12,000 construction establishments were examined, and 1600 persons were provided with training on \\nhousing and construction.

Besides, different internal  roads and \\ndrains of market places wer e constructed.  \\nThe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED )  \\nLGED through its intervention since 1990s has tried to address planned intervention in infrastructure \\ndevelopment, maintenance and rehabilitation needs and to develop the capacity of the mu nicipalities, \\nespecially to raise income, improve financial management capacity and design municipal services in a \\nplanned way. Various development projects have been implemented related to a range of urban \\ninfrastructure services including water supply, d rainage, sanitation, urban roads, and urban market places.  \\nAdditionally, projects and programmes have been implemented to develop the capacities of urban LGIs.  \\nThese projects have been implemented  in nine city corporations and 328 municipalities, and the y have \\ndirectly benefitted around 50 million people having impact on urban economy, environment, and livelihood. \\nThe overall urban milieu has marched into an environment of accelerated growth.  \\nLessons Learnt from Past Development Interventions and Key Con strains  \\nIn addition to the constraint imposed by the inadequacy of the urban governance structure noted earlier, a s \\nan input to the development of the urban strategy for the 8FYP, it will be helpful to review the good practices \\nof past interventions and c onstraints that were faced.  \\nA. Urban Accessibility and Transport  \\nTo meet the growing infrastructure  demand owing to rapid urbanization, the municipalities are being \\nextended to service the adjoining villages gradually. Therefore, the adjoining villages are r equiring more   \\n \\n544 \\n and planned urban infrastructures which are not being met properly.  For example, the urban infrastructure \\nshould be inclusive with drains, roads, footpath, median as well as streetlight. Under the 7FYP, a World \\nBank -supported Municipal Gover nance Support Project (MGSP) has shown good -practice examples of \\ninclusive infrastructures in 26 municipalities. The urban infrastructures included roads along with drains, \\nmedians and footpath. The roads were developed with at least 6m width to meet the p resent and future \\ntraffic.  \\nB. Urban Drainage  \\nBangladesh has been experiencing erratic rainfall owing to the effect of climate change, floods in some \\nmunicipalities and water logging in a major number of municipalities has become a common feature during \\nthe monsoon period. In addition to human sufferings, the water logging is causing damage to roads and \\nproperties. The good practice response has involved the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of drainage system according to drainage master plan and considering a whole \\nnetwork from starting to outfall.  \\n\\uf0b7 The urban roads of the municipalities that remain water logged during monsoon   are being \\nconstructed as concrete or block roads. Although the solution is good, it is not sustainable in some \\nmunicipalities owing to defect ive construction practices or lack of knowledge of technical staff of \\nthe municipalities. Therefore, there should be a good research regarding the weaknesses involved \\nin the design and construction methods of concrete roads and block roads.  \\nConstraints  \\n\\uf0b7 In the coastal districts, drainage plans must include ebbs and tides. It should be designed carefully \\non a case by case basis. The usual and average design of technical staff may not be a good practice.  \\n\\uf0b7 The urban drainage does not work properly if not acco mpanied by waste management practices. \\nThe drains get clogged and leads to logging of sewage water.  \\nC. Urban Amenities: Parks, Waterfront Parks, Children Parks, Playground, Public Plaza   \\nParks are the lungs of the cities as they can provide pure air to the citizen. During the 7FYP, some parks \\nhave been constructed. Some of the good practices here are  \\n\\uf0b7 Waterfront parks that can be constructed in synergy with other development projects such as river, \\ncanal dredging of BWDB, BIWTA or LGED. It that case, there i s more value addition to these \\ntypes of projects.  \\n\\uf0b7 In the bridge construction projects, LGED has been utilizing the river banks (the space acquired as \\napproach of bridge or being used as ground level of viaduct) as waterfront parks.  \\n\\uf0b7 There were concerns re garding the management of children parks during its planning stage. The \\nmunicipalities have been able to operate them effectively by leasing them. The parks have created \\na good number of employment opportunities in addition to providing public satisfaction .    \\n \\n545 \\n Constraints  \\n\\uf0b7 Space is a major constraint for parks and public space development. More developed nations use \\nthe riverfront spaces for parks. In Bangladesh, the riverfront spaces have been occupied or being \\noccupied for illegal settlements  or business. T he national river conservation commission and \\nBIWTA have been active to restore the riverfront public spaces. LGED can also take the lead for \\nrestoration of riverfront spaces and development with help from the district administration.  \\n\\uf0b7 Urban land shortage is acute that constrains public space for parks, playgrounds etc. The school \\ngrounds and other available spaces can also be used for developing small parks, playgrounds. The \\nmunicipalities can motivate people to donate land for recreational purpose.  \\nD. Solid  Waste Management  \\nIn the area of solid waste management, the traditional approach to collecting solid waste and burying them \\nin a landfill dump is giving way to more scientific and environmentally safe approach to complete solution \\nmethod.  The complete s olution method includes integrated waste management system that includes transfer \\nstation, compost plant, biogas plant, controlled landfill cell, faecal  sludge management etc.  Three LGED \\nprojects have been working for complete solution in waste management  in four municipalities.  In Jashore, \\nan integrated waste management plant has gone under successful operation. By June 2021, three other \\nmunicipalities will have complete solution for solid waste management. The same concept has been \\nincorporated in a num ber of pipeline projects assisted by development partners.  \\nE. Urban Governance   \\nUrban governance involves a range of actors, institutions and dynamic actions that relates to the capacity \\nto deliver the services to the citizen effectively. Since 1990s, throug h its different developing partner \\nassisted projects, LGED has been working for improving urban governance in the municipalities. It has \\nbeen always a challenge to sustain the good practices after the completion of the projects. Therefore, a good \\nstrategy is to be developed to mainstream urban governance in urban LGIs.  \\nThe town level coordination committees (TLCC)  \\nTo facilitate urban governance, a number of LGED projects had taken the initiative to form town level \\ncoordination committees in the municipali ties. It was a part of the institutionalization process to promote \\nurban governance. Although TLCCs have been formed in all the municipalities, their activities and \\ninfluence over the development decisions vary considerably and depend on the attitude of th e mayors.  \\nRevenue generation and self -reliance   \\nCity corporations and municipalities remain strongly dependent on government transfers.  Own resource \\nmobilization has generally lagged behind.  There is no good practice example so far.  This is one area w here \\nthe 8FYP will seek to make a break through based on the recommendations  in Chapter 7, Part 2.  \\n   \\n \\n546 \\n Capacity Development of Municipalities  \\na) ICT based office management & decision making  \\nBased on several interventions of different projects of LGED, a numbe r of software  was developed for tax \\nbilling & collection, water billing etc. The municipal staffs were  trained to operate the software. Yet, there \\nis ample scope for improvement regarding tax assessment, improvement of transparency, office automation \\netc. Under the 8FYP, ICT -based office management and decision making will be a priority.  \\nb) Training of Municipality Staff  \\nLGED is entrusted with providing training to most of the staff of the municipalities. Every year, LGED \\nprovides training to around 5000 sta ff with a revenue budget of around 1.20 crore BDT and project budget \\nof around 2.5 crore BDT. To provide training in a comprehensive way, the urban management unit of LGED \\nrequires more staff and capacity building.  \\nc) Physical Development Plan/ Master Plan  \\nTo develop the municipalities in a comprehensive, sustainable and planned way, development plan is the \\nmost important tool. Local Government Division and Local Government Engineering Department have so \\nfar developed development plans for 256 municipalities . Six development plans of different municipalities \\nwere developed by RAJUK and other development authorities. Therefore, out of 329 municipalities, 67 \\nmunicipalities are still waiting for a development plan.  \\n9.7.3 Development Programmes for Addressing Co ngestion Problems of Dhaka  \\nFor addressing the transport problems of Dhaka megacity, the government has implemented several flyover \\nprojects and is currently implementing a metro -rail project. The capital city has witnessed seven flyovers \\nbuilt in and aroun d it over the past 15 years, aiming to mitigate its nagging traffic jams. Seven flyovers --- \\nMohakhali, Khilgaon, Tejgaon, Banani, Kuril, Jatrabari and Mogbazar -- cumulatively offer an elevated \\nroad spanning of 29 kilometres  and costing over Tk 4,000 crore .     \\nAs noted in the Transport Chapter (Chapter 6, part 2), the government has initiated  a major program to \\nintroduce mass transit facilities for Dhaka. Some 6 MRT lines and 1 BRT line will be completed by 2035 \\nat a cost of about US$23.2 Billion. Construc tion work of the Tk 22,000 -crore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT \\nLine) -6, which began in 2016 is expected to be opened to the public on December 16, 2021.   This will be \\na major  breakthrough in Dhaka urban transportation and is expected to considerably easy traffi c congest ion. \\n9.8 8FYP URBAN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  \\nThe PP2041 has developed a very thoughtful and well -articulated urban sector vision and broad \\ndevelopment strategy to implement that vision.  Essentially, the vision and strategy entail the development \\nof a ro ad map that will allow Bangladesh to have an urban environment in FY2041that is now found in HIC \\nlike Korea.  To move towards that goal, the PP2041 envisages major institutional reforms for urban and \\nrural LGIs.  The reforms entail institution of an urban LGI governance structure that is characterized by the \\nfollowing features found in high -performing UMICs and HICs:    \\n \\n547 \\n 1) Cities will be characterized by a governance system that entails democratically elected, strong and \\naccountable city governments. These urban governments are independent of the political \\ndominance of the national government and are only accountable to the residents of the city.  \\n2) City governments will have well -defined responsibilities that are enshrined in the legal framework. \\nThese responsibilit ies do not change based on national or local election results. There is no conflict \\nor overlap in delivering service with higher levels of government.  \\n3) The coordination mechanisms with higher levels of government in the management of common \\nareas will be we ll defined within the principle that matters that involve exclusively the interest of \\nthe city are primarily the responsibility of the city.  \\n4) Financial autonomy of cities will be ensured through a legally defined financial framework that \\ninvolves sharing o f taxes, national grants and market borrowing.  \\n5) User charges and beneficiary -pays-principle will play a major role in city finances.  \\n6) To protect public interests and provide a common reference point for the country, minimum \\nstandards will be defined for such  issues as environmental protection, water quality and air quality \\nand these standards are monitored by the higher government.  \\n7) To ensure an adequate supply of certain merit /public goods, the national grant system will be used \\nfor co -financing or as incent ive payments.  \\n8) Urban planning and strategy will be a shared responsibility between the city and higher -level \\ngovernments.  At the city level, the planning process will be participatory with a well -defined and \\nstructured consultation process with the residen ts. \\n \\nThe above governance reforms of urban LGIs articulated in the PP2041 is based on a recognition that in a \\nmarket economy urbanization will be linked to the growth of economic activities.  The role of public policy \\nto influence the pattern of urbanizati on will depend upon incentives, regulations, public investments and \\ninstitutions. Global experience clearly shows the need for decentralized and autonomous urban \\ngovernments as a key part of the political and administrative layout underlying a HIC. A sound  strategy for \\nreforming city management calls as articulated above calls for a three -pronged approach: (i) redefining \\npublic -private roles with a view to strengthening this partnership for better services; (ii) strengthening \\ncapabilities of public urban se rvice institutions; and (iii) establishing an accountable city government.  \\nUnder the 8FYP, the LGD will take the lead to develop the first phase of a time -bound actionable \\nimplementation plan for the periods FY2021 -FY2025 in consultation with the LGIs, ot her ministries and \\nnational research institutions. This action plan will be submitted to the cabinet for approval by December \\n2021 with implementation targeted for July 2022.  \\nAlong with these over -arching urban governance reforms, the functioning of the e xisting urban institutions \\nand service agencies will be strengthened to improve the delivery of basic urban services. The main strategic \\nconsiderations that will guide this effort are discussed below.  \\n9.8.1  Spatial Development Strategies   \\nPromoting Balance d Urbanization with Focus on Secondary Cities  \\nOne major feature of urbanization in Bangladesh is the over -whelming predominance of the capital city \\nDhaka which accounts for about 32 per cent  of the total urban population of Bangladesh. Dhaka is \\ndominating not only in terms of its share of urban population but also in terms of the concentration of civil   \\n \\n548 \\n administration, economy, trade, commerce and industry. Currently Dhaka accounts for about 34% of the \\ncountry’s GDP. Such excessive concentration of populatio n and economic activities has probably exceeded \\nthe optimal limits and the ranking of Dhaka by Economist Intelligence Unit as the 3rd lowest city in terms \\nof liveability  bears ample testimony to this fact.  \\nIn view of the negative consequences of Dhaka’s o vergrowth, the 8FYP would focus on the development \\nof secondary cities which are medium sized administrative, political, industrial, transportation, tourism and \\nhistorical centres functioning at a level below primary or metropolitan cities. They range in p opulation from \\n100,000 to 2.5 million and play a crucial role as economic, social and logistics hubs or centres. It is now \\nwidely recognized that systems of secondary cities will have a greater influence upon the economic \\ndevelopment of nations and larger geographic regions in the future. There are about 42 secondary cities in \\nBangladesh. For making the secondary cities more competitive and attractive as places for investment the \\ngovernment would take measures for the development of infrastructure, services , innovation, human \\ncapital, good government and strong enabling environments. Special emphasis will be given on  \\n\\uf0b7 The provision of common user facilities (warehousing, infrastructure)  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of technology and innovation parks  \\n\\uf0b7 Streamlining import -expor t approval and clearance  \\n\\uf0b7 Investment in high quality training, research and development facilities.   \\n\\uf0b7 Attracting private investments in infrastructure and utilities that reduce production and distribution \\ncosts within their economies  \\n \\nThe government will al so adopt an urbanization strategy that will guide investment decisions around the \\ncountry for balanced urban and regional development. Following steps will be taken during the plan period \\nto implement the strategy:  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of urban development plans fo r all the urban areas/centres consisting of Structure Plans, \\nDetailed Area Plans and Action Plans  \\n\\uf0b7 Enact appropriate laws to formalize the current building control practices in the urban areas around \\nthe country.  \\n\\uf0b7 Extending the Pourashava  plans that were pre pared the legal status via gazettes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of District level regional plans and Upazila level sub -regional plans. Through these \\nlinkages  can be established between Macro (National) level planning (FYP, Perspective Plan) and \\nMicro (Regional/Sub -region al/Local) level planning  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparations  of infrastructure plan (road, drain, natural water course) that can help prioritize \\ninvestment in drainage planning and sewerage infrastructure throughout the country.  \\n\\uf0b7 On a pilot basis, carry out one or more tools in land management such as guided land development \\n(GLD), land readjustment, or land pooling in the fringe areas of some urban areas of the country.  \\n\\uf0b7 Land use regulation for areas outside the jurisdiction of the statutory urban plans will be  developed \\nand enfo rced in view of the fact that many areas will become urban soon.  \\n\\uf0b7 Undertake urban conservation and renewal projects for old, traditional and culturally rich areas. \\nSuch plans will use traditional tools such as provision of infrastructure and building contr ol as well \\nas transfer of development rights. Other appropriately designed incentives may include low or no \\nholding tax for buildings worthy of conservation.    \\n \\n549 \\n \\uf0b7 Adopt building codes for the entire country. [Currently there are building codes for small number \\nof urban areas such as Dhaka and Chittagong cities.]  \\n\\uf0b7 Enable concerned agencies in enforcing building codes to protect buildings against hazards such as \\nfire. \\n\\uf0b7  Prepare plans to deal with emerging hazards that will have implication for land development and \\nurban expansion.  \\nPromotion of Economic Development Corridor (EDC)  \\nThe promotion of economic development corridors within and between countries has become an important \\nfocus of attention in recent years. A corridor is a system made up of several components,  including \\ninfrastructure (roads, railways, and ports ), transport and logistics services and regulations which include \\nseveral secondary cities and metropolitan areas. Secondary and metropolitan cities located in the corridor \\nwill be planned for developmen t of specialized production, value -adding, export, distribution of goods and \\nservices, and logistics hubs. Priority will be given to investment in developing ICT systems and networks, \\nand to soft infrastructure support, such as education and training of sm all and micro -business networking. \\nThe 8FYP will give special emphasis on the development of hard and soft infrastructure (i.e., roads, rail, \\nair services and political, social, and business networks) for facilitating the flows of materials, people, trade,  \\ngoods, services, and information among the cities of the development corridor.  \\nDevelopment of EDCs will be helpful in balancing population pressure and distribution of economic \\ndevelopment across a range of cities (small, medium and large). This will als o help development of Special \\nEconomic Zones (SEZs) in the country. SEZs closer to  large cities will be able to specialize in knowledge -\\nbased and high -tech industries and activities because of the availability of appropriate business environment \\nand thus w ould achieve higher efficiency and productivity. Similarly, SEZs closer to medium and small -\\nsized cities will be able to specialize in agro -based and moderate technology manufacturing industries.  \\n9.8.2 Institutional Development Strategies   \\nInstitutional Re form at the Local Level  \\nSustainable urbanization cannot be achieved without institutional arrangements capable of exploiting the \\neconomic potentials of cities and towns. Urban development therefore should encompass institutional \\nstrengthening and capacity building, decentralization, community participation, and involvement of the \\nprivate sector in the development of the urban sector.  Institutional reform at the local level, therefore, will \\nfocus on the following:  \\nInvolving Stakeholders in Planning and Deve lopment  \\nAll the organizations and institutions which operate at the local level in connection with the development \\nand/or operation and maintenance of infrastructure and services as well as socio -economic development \\nwill be involved for implementation of Development Programmes. The local government would be the lead \\nagency for coordination and integration of all the efforts of participating organizations including the local \\ngovernment, public sector agencies, private sector actors, non -governmental organiz ations and the \\ncommunity. This would maximize efficiency and effectiveness of development programmes .    \\n \\n550 \\n Proper Definition of Institutional Responsibilities  \\nClear division of powers and allocation of resources in the major areas of urban planning, developme nt and \\nmanagement across different levels of governments will be ensured so that there is no overlap or gap in \\nimplementation of an agreed urban plan. Steps will be taken for clear division of powers and allocation of \\nresources at the municipal level among  the various agencies and departments within the municipality.  \\nCapacity Building of Urban Local Government  \\nCapacity building of local government bodies would focus on strengthening managerial, technical, financial \\nand regulatory capabilities. Area specific  skills that are very important for enhancing capacity of urban \\nlocal governments are the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Managerial:  Policymaking, conflict resolution, establishing administrative and public \\nparticipation processes, and developing training programmes  and infor mation systems etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Technical:  Planning, operations and maintenance in key areas of urban development and \\nmanagement.  \\n\\uf0b7 Regulatory: revising laws and codes and setting regulatory standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial:  capital budgeting municipal accounting and finance tariff  and tax structures, revenue \\ncollection procedures etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Urban Planning:  capacity development of municipalities for updating and enforcement of master \\nplan.  Adequate staff with urban planners and necessary instruments for enforcement should be \\ndeveloped.  \\n \\nFor reducing dependence of Paurashavas and City Corporations on central government agencies steps \\nwould be taken for improving the staff capabilities of these urban local bodies. Emphasis would be given \\non quantitative as well as qualitative aspects. It is obvious that professionals such as urban planners, \\nengineers, doctors, veterinary specialists, finance and management professionals, economists, etc. would \\nbe required and such requirements should be reflected in the staffing patterns of the Paurashavas , especially \\nthe ‘A’ class Pourashavas.  Organograms of Local Government Bodies therefore should be revised on the \\nbasis of such needs.  \\n9.8.3 Strategies for Development of Infrastructure and Services  \\nBasic Urban Services  \\nThis sub -sector includes water suppl y, sewage and waste water treatment, drainage, and services such as \\nstreet lights. National government agencies and the local government bodies have the primary responsibility \\nto provide or enable delivery of services. There are, however, a host of other a ctors, including the private \\nsector, communities and non -governmental organizations that can participate in service provision and \\nmanagement under the coordination of local authorities /urban local bodies. To ensure more equitable \\nprovision of basic infras tructure and service delivery system, steps will be taken to establish support \\nmechanisms to enable people living in poverty and the disadvantaged to have access to basic infrastructure \\nand services.    \\n \\n551 \\n One important objective that deserves emphasis is that reaching a quantitative target is not enough. \\nSustaining the achievements in light of the growing population also requires planning, resource allocation \\nand action. The strategic focus of the plan in this sub -sector would be the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of s trategic plan for sustainable water supply (both surface and underground)  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of appropriate and affordable technological options in the hydro -geologically \\ndifficult and problematic areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Technologies such as rainwater harvesting needs to be explo red (this might have added benefit of \\nreducing run -off) \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure enforcement and capacity building against polluters  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of sewerage master plan  \\n\\uf0b7 Implementation of Faecal  Sludge Management (FSM) master plan to serve the decentralized septic \\ntask \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen sewage collection services from slums and low-income  communities  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of sewage treatment plant for all cities  \\n\\uf0b7 Use energy efficient and low maintenance street and community lighting systems  \\n\\uf0b7 Help to urban local government bodies in preparing w aste management master plans. This is \\nimportant for smaller urban areas where there is still room for setting aside land for transfer stations \\nand dump sites.  \\n\\uf0b7 Incentivize private sector investment in solid waste recycling  \\n\\uf0b7 Make citizens a ware to sort waste  at source and dump appropriately.  \\n \\nWater and Sanitation Services  \\nCreating an enabling environment  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of strategic plan for sustainable water supply (both surface and underground)  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of appropriate and affordable technological options i n the hydro -geologically \\ndifficult and problematic areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Technologies such as rainwater harvesting needs to be explored (this might have added benefit of \\nreducing run -off) \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure enforcement and capacity building against polluters  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of sewerage  master plan and in that context creates  an enabling environment for FSM. \\nThe following activities will be conducted to enable FSM systems to flourish:  \\n\\uf0d8 Implementing the Institutional Regulatory framework: The Institutional Regulatory Framework \\nfor FSM (IRF -FSM) was published and disseminated by the Policy Support Branch (PSB) of the \\nLocal Government Division (LGD) under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development \\nand Cooperatives (MoLGRD&C) in 2017. DPHE established an FSM support cell to plan, desi gn \\nand monitor the activities of capacity building, awareness campaigns, and standardization of the \\nservices and implementation of IRF -FSM through different projects. With the IRF -FSM \\nestablished, GoB will now focus on putting the framework into practice a nd scale up existing efforts \\nunder the 8th Plan.  \\n   \\n \\n552 \\n \\uf0d8 Strengthening institutional capacity of municipalities: The very limited institutional capacity of \\nmunicipalities is one of the major drawbacks in the operationalization of not only FSM but broader \\nwater a nd sanitation services. Municipalities suffer from inadequate human resources as well as \\nfinancial constraints and lack the technology and means to ensure sustainable service delivery. \\nDuring the 8FYP  period, the GoB will take necessary steps to equip the municipalities and \\nstrengthen their capacity to provide universal access to improved water and sanitation services in a \\nfinancially sustainable manner. Special attention will be given to provide skill development \\ntrainings to potential women’s group for op eration of sanitation services and to encourage \\nmunicipalities to deploy women workers.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Stimulating private sector engagement: The Sector Development Plan (SDP) advocates increasing \\nprivate sector participation in sanitation services. However, the countr y is yet to see large scale \\nprivate sector engagement in the sector. Experts consider private sector engagement as a key factor \\nbehind successful operation of FSM services. Some private sector entities are currently engaged in \\nFSM services. However, awaren ess surrounding FSM in secondary towns is low. Private sector \\nwill be involved in the planning stages of FSM services which create  a gap when it comes to service \\ndelivery. At present, incentives for private sector to engage in FSM services remain  low. Suit able \\nbusiness models and availability of attractive financing will be ensured to encourage/stimulating \\nprivate sector engagement towards sustainable service delivery.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Developing Sanitation Safety Plan: Bangladesh has already developed a water safety plan (WSP) \\nto promote a risk -based approach to water safety and to subsequently protect public health. \\nSimilarly, a sanitation safety plan will be prepared with a view to articulate a step -by-step risk -\\nbased approach to assist in the implementation of local lev el risk assessment and management for \\nthe sanitation service chain. The sanitation safety plan would be targeted for the local level \\nauthorities but could also be used in other sector actors such as community -based organizations \\nand NGOs.  \\nIn the area of sa nitation, the strategy entails capturing the entire sanitation value chain for an effective faecal \\nsludge management (FSM) in all cities and pauroshavas. It will aim at containing the faecal sludge by \\nempting properly and transporting those to a treatment facility  so that there is no leakage to the external \\nenvironment. The treatment facilities or plants would need to be widely built and maintained in pourashovas \\nto process faecal sludge for further use as compost  or for safely discharging into the environm ent.  \\nFSM services are yet to gain significant foothold in Bangladesh. However, GoB has been active in \\noperationalizing FSM. One of the first initiatives in FSM was by DPHE under the “Secondary Towns Water \\nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project” (GoB -ADB) fr om 2006 to June 2014, in which faecal sludge \\ntreatment plants (FSTPs) were constructed in 11 secondary pourashavas. DPHE implemented the \\nconstruction and handed over the completed FSTPs to the pourashavas for ownership, operation and \\nmanagement. More recen tly, GoB has taken the initiative to build more than 100 FSTPs across the country \\nwith support from development partners such as World Bank, ADB, and Islamic Development Bank. Many \\nof these projects also involve the provision of vacutugs which are used for  mechanized collection and \\ntransportation of faecal sludge. The Local Government Division (LGD) has recently established CWIS -\\nFSM (city wide inclusive sanitation -FSM) support cell in the DPHE in a notion to accelerate overall \\nsanitation target of SDG6.2. T he CWIS -FSM support cell will work in collaboration with the sector actors   \\n \\n553 \\n for sustainable FSM operation. To ensure sustainability of these FSTPs and efficiency of the overall FSM, \\nit is also essential to draw lessons from previous experiences as well as on-going  good practices in the \\nsector. One such model of FSM is illustrated in Box [ 9.1].  \\nBox 9.1: Sakhipur FSTP and Co -Composting Plant  \\nThe Sakhipur FSTP and co -composting plant is located in Tangail district, 3 km from the town centre. The \\nmunicipality owns the plant with technical support from WaterAid and NGO partner BASA. With operations \\nbeginning in 2016, the plant and associated service has demonstrated a feasible mechanism for operating FSM. The \\nvacutug owned by the municipality is used to collect faecal sludge from households after interested households \\nsubmit an application and pay emptying fees. The vacutug is then used to transport the collected sludge to the FSTP \\nand co -composting plant.  \\nThe treatment consists of 10 unplanted drying beds, and the dried sludge is co -composted with organic waste in the \\nco-composting plant located within the FSTP compound. The compost is packaged and sold in the market. Local \\nfarmers use this compost as a soil conditioner and their feedback is encouraging. The Dep artment of Agricultural \\nExtension at Sakhipur has been providing further technical guidance for reuse and distribution among local farmers.  \\nCurrently, the operation and maintenance of the plant is managed jointly by the Municipality and WaterAid. Income \\nis generated from the tariffs for waste collection and from compost sales, recovering about 70% of the cost. \\nAlthough the plant is yet to be financially self -sustainable, it has demonstrated a working modality of FSM services \\ncapturing the entire sanitation  value chain, which can be scaled up further.  \\n \\nUrban Transportation  \\nCities are the major sources of national economic growth while transport is considered as the lifeblood of \\ncities. Poor transport inhibits growth of cities and makes them dysfunctional. Urban transportation strategies \\nwill focus on developing an integrated and balanced transportation system taking into consideration the \\nneeds of the road system, non -motorized transport, public passenger transport and mass transit issues such \\nas a city’s b alance in the locations of employment and housing, demand management, and the roles for the \\npublic and private sectors.  \\nReducing congestion in city roads, especially in Dhaka Metropolitan Area, would depend on considerable \\nreduction of dependency on priva te automobiles, taxi cabs, baby taxies, and non -motorized transport modes \\nsuch as rickshaws. Steps, therefore, have been taken to introduce rail -based mass transit system and Bus \\nRapid Transit in Dhaka. Such systems will also be introduced in other primary  cities, especially in \\nChattogram. Other strategies to address the problems of urban transportation would include the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of comprehensive traffic management plan for major cities which includes \\nestablishment of hierarchy of roads, ensur e footpath and pedestrian ways, provide sustainable and \\nefficient public transport services and ensure multi -modal integration.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provision of sustainable and appropriate public transport services in cities and ensuring regulatory \\nmeasure for efficient, reli able, affordable, and convenient public transport services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Controlling car population by introducing appropriate taxation mechanism and incentivizing public \\ntransport user.  \\n\\uf0b7 Controlling emission by enforcing maintenance standard, fuel standard etc.   \\n \\n554 \\n \\uf0b7 The Go vernment will provide fiscal incentives for hybrid technologies, electric vehicles and \\nimposing strict penalties for the violation of environmental codes by polluters in the transportation \\nsector.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of city specific comprehensive plan for Non -Motorized Transport fostering safer non -\\nmotorized vehicle operations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Urban road projects in large, medium and small municipalities should be developed as inclusive \\ninfrastructures i.e. roads, drains, footpath, median simultaneously. The urban roads should be  at \\nleast 6.0 m wide.  \\n\\uf0b7 Imposition of traffic and road discipline strictly taking help of loses  circuit infrared cameras.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring training and appropriate skill for drivers  \\n\\uf0b7 Patronizing Transit Oriented Development (TOD) in cities with high capacity public transportation \\n(MRT/LRT/BRT).  \\n\\uf0b7 Linking major cities with surrounding towns with good road, water and rail infrastructure and good \\npublic transport services  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of water ways where appropriate and integrate with rail and road  \\n\\uf0b7 Restructuring institut ional arrangement to manage transport and public transport services and \\nenhance capacity of the concerned institution.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of traffic demand management to reduce traffic volume through such measures as \\nparking prohibitions, fuel pricing, charges f or use of specific routes, limiting entry to city centre, \\nencouragement to public transport, pedestrianization of congested areas, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) in Dhaka for covering such areas as electronic \\nroad pricing, traffic management, integrated ticketing systems for different public transport modes, \\nand coordination of public transport modes and online timetables.  \\n9.8.4 Urban Land and Housing Development Strategies  \\nUrban land development and management  \\nSound land management  policies are crucial in solving urban land problems. The government will take \\nappropriate measures to promote sustainable land -use planning and innovative land management practices \\nwith particular focus on:  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing land information system to support pl anning and decision -making by local authorities, \\nprivate sector investments and infrastructure development decisions by the government.  \\n\\uf0b7 Using appropriate planning tools (structure/strategic planning, urban/detailed area planning, action \\nplanning) for promo ting land use patterns in the desired direction.  \\n\\uf0b7 Applying participatory approaches to land development to promote efficient and sustainable land \\ndevelopment through techniques such as Land Pooling / Readjustment and Guided Land \\nDevelopment  \\n\\uf0b7 Policy instrumen ts such as land pooling and land readjustment will be used in innovative public -\\nprivate -community partnerships to manage and coordinate urban expansion. Existing laws \\nregulating transaction, development and access to land will be reviewed and modified to s upport \\ninnovative land development and management practices that facilitate land pooling, land \\nreadjustment, guided land development, development of the informal sector and poor’s access to land.     \\n \\n555 \\n \\uf0b7 Following the National Housing Policy (NHP) -2016 urban land  bank will be established in \\ncoordination with land ministry to materialize housing development process with unutilized \\nabundant government land ( Khas Land).  \\nHousing Development  \\nThe government’s main role will be to act as an ‘enabler’ rather than a provid er of housing. The strategies \\nwill focus on.  \\n\\uf0b7 Helping the land market to work efficiently by modernizing the legal and regulatory framework, \\ncomputerizing the land record system and improving the efficiency of the recording, registration, \\nand mapping of hou se ownership and transactions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Creating Efficient Housing Market through continuous assessment of housing demand and supply \\nas well as collection, analysis and dissemination of information about housing markets on a regular \\nbasis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving the Mechanism f or Financing Housing by stimulating the efficiency and the dynamism \\nof the mortgage market by ensuring a level playing field, carrying out reforms in land \\nadministration and regulatory environment, and restructuring BHBFC  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing Basic Infrastructure and  Services . \\n\\uf0b7 Supporting Development of Appropriate Building Materials and Technologies . \\n\\uf0b7 Extending housing Loans through Financial Institutions to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, \\nlow-income people and people living in poverty. The range of financial inst itutions will be \\nbroadened particularly to cater for the provision of small loans . \\n\\uf0b7 Consider construction of social housing projects with particular emphasis on developing model and \\ndesign of projects in view of the fact that large apartment buildings in so cial housing projects may \\nbe turned into poverty ghettos.  \\n\\uf0b7 Undertaking programmes for physical improvement of the slum/informal settlements that will \\ngreatly facilitate the integration of the settlements with the wider urban area and also improve \\nquality of  life of their residents.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of rental housing, which caters for the needs of the majority of the low -income \\nhouseholds. This renting ranges from getting and / or sharing a room in a slum area to being \\nprovided affordable cluster housing by privat e developers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exploring the possibility of providing  collective tenure security for communities so as to eliminate \\nthe need for individual titling and ameliorating land speculation and price increases.  Group tenure \\narrangements, whereby block is registered  under a lease agreement to the group or a local authority \\nwill also be explored.  \\n\\uf0b7 To Ensure equitable distribution of resource, special quota will be kept for poor and challenged \\npeople in allocation process of publicly developed plots. Land development ac tivities commenced \\nby community organization and non -profit organizations will be given special support (NHP -2016)  \\n\\uf0b7 For addressing backlog in housing supply PPP can be used. Government can release government \\nowned land for PPP for lower and lower middle -income people.  \\n\\uf0b7 As emphasized by the National Housing Policy low income people will be subsidized in land \\nallocation process through the profit gained from selling of land at proper price to high income   \\n \\n556 \\n people for housing, industrial/commercial and other simil ar non -residential uses. Similar system \\nwill be adopted for flat distribution . \\n\\uf0b7 Providing housing for all including the shelter less  and implementing the goals and objectives of \\nthe Housing Policy through construction of residential flats, and plots . \\n\\uf0b7 Enforc ement of real estate development and residential land development laws to accommodate \\nlow income population.  \\n9.8.5 Urban Environmental and Disaster Management strategies  \\nUrban Environmental Management  \\nThe adverse environmental conditions resulting from ina dequate waste management, poor drainage, air \\npollution, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, exposure to excessive noise levels, as well \\nas inadequate health services not only exact a heavy toll on the quality of life but also cause  irrepa rable \\ndamage to natural ecosystems in cities and surrounding areas. Since the environmental problems are \\ncomplex, multidimensional, and interactive, addressing these problems requires the combined efforts of \\nmany actors including the national and local gov ernments, the private sector and the civil society.  \\nThe government would emphasize a holistic and integrated approach, with particular attention to \\nparticipatory planning and management, public -private partnerships, capacity building and cost -recovery. \\nSpecific measures that will be taken during the plan period include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Designating all ponds/water bodies in Detailed Area Plan Map of Dhaka and protect them \\naccording to the ecological importance and public interest.  \\n\\uf0b7 Stopping housing estate, industries and o ther development work in wetlands through earth filling.  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoiding water bodies during planning of roads, housing and industrial estates.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhancing plantation and gardening to increase the natural beauty in urban areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preserving the wetlands like ponds , beels, khals demarking buffer distance as lakes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoiding critical ecological area and refuge sites from development works.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting low/no polluting technology  \\n\\uf0b7 Introducing and promoting different environmental improvement initiatives and green initi atives \\ne.g. green building, energy efficient building, zero emission building, green city, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introducing environmental audit, energy audit and water audit along with financial audit  \\n\\uf0b7 Extending the sewerage network to cover 10% of households in city are as within the plan period \\nand bringing all sewage in treatment plant  \\n\\uf0b7 Treating solid waste management as a system (i.e. together with collection, disposal and resource \\nrecovery) and as a priority sector as it is tied to many ills such as waterlogging. Some  of the general \\ntools to achieve the goals are:  \\n\\uf0a7 Incentivizing firms for door to door collection where it still does not exist.  \\n\\uf0a7 Awareness building to increase sorting and recycling.  \\n\\uf0a7 Promoting 3R (provide easy access of financing)  \\n\\uf0a7 Promoting Waste to Energy w here appropriate  \\n\\uf0a7 Given large organic content, encourage composting    \\n \\n557 \\n \\uf0b7 Improvement of Environmental/Ecological Health of Rivers flowing through or near the cities and \\nurban areas e.g. Buriganga, Sitalakkhya, Turag, Balu, Bongshi, Moyuri (in Khulna), Karnaphuli  \\n(Chattogram), etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improvement of public transport - metro rail, Rapid Bus Transit, good rail network, good network \\nof navigable rivers encouraging private sector participation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enforcement of Polluter Pay Principle  \\n\\uf0b7 Capacity building of DoE in monitoring,  investigating, and examining pollution  \\n \\nUrban Climate Change and Disaster Management  \\nOne of the key emerging issues that cities and towns are to contend with is climate change, with adverse \\nimpacts capable of undermining the ability of cities to achieve s ustainable development. Urban areas in the \\ncountry face a number institutional, planning and governance challenges to address the climate change. \\nThese include problems of coordination among various local government institutions and central \\ngovernment agen cies, establishing more effective planning and urban management practices that take into \\naccount Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), financing disaster \\nmanagement activities and climate change adaptation, and community partic ipation in disaster \\npreparedness, planning and climate change adaptation. Keeping in view the above -mentioned problems, \\nthe government will take following steps during the 8FYP  period:  \\nStrengthening Institutions  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen City Disaster Management Committ ee (CDMC) involving other stakeholders such as \\nthe private sector, research institutes, national agencies and utility companies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen monitoring and evaluation of the existing mechanisms for compliance and enforcement \\nof laws, regulations etc. throug h conducting regular capacity building workshops of city personnel. \\nSensitize legislations, regulations and codes in relation to Climate Change (CC) and Disaster Risk \\nReduction (DRR).  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote close coordination and cooperation among national disaster manag ement and \\nenvironmental management agencies (i.e. Department of Environment (DoE), department of \\nDisaster Management (DoDM)) urban local bodies (City Corporations and Paurashavas), non -\\ngovernmental and private sector organizations;  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrate city CC -DRR po licies and plans in national preparedness and response system. Strengthen \\npartnerships with relevant organizations for technical assistance, researches and techno -\\nenvironment projects.  \\n \\nPlanning  \\n\\uf0b7 Prepare and implement integrated, environmentally -sound urban  planning and management \\nincorporating environmental and disaster related information and reflecting environmental and \\ndisaster management policies and standards. Considerations will also be given to spatial, \\nintersectoral, inter -temporal and environmental  media related factors with special attention to key \\naspects of land and water -use planning.    \\n \\n558 \\n \\uf0b7 Review and update the city’s transportation plan to include disaster risk reduction measures \\n(providing accessibility to and linkages with risk -prone areas). Inte grate CC -DRR in all key sectors \\nthrough multi -stakeholder and participatory workshops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of a comprehensive information system that identifies and assesses the risks \\ninvolved in disaster -prone areas and integrate it into urban planning and desi gn.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparing community -based disaster preparedness and response plans putting emphasis on early \\nwarning system that reaches everyone, measures to protect houses, identification of safe evacuation \\nsites and provisions to help those less able to move quick ly. \\n \\nCommunity Participation  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities through the contributions of the \\nvolunteers, local community groups and non -governmental organizations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Facilitate the operation of the disaster preparedness and response mechanisms in a much more \\ncoordinated but flexible manner through partnership arrangements with the private sector and in \\nclose coordination with all community groups  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop Municipal -Community Partnership (MCP) to improve, basic utilities, social service s and \\nneighbourhood environment.  \\n9.9 8FYP URBAN SECTOR  GOALS, STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMMES BY \\nMINISTRIES/DIVISIONS  \\n9.9.1 Ministry of Housing and Public Works  \\nGoal  \\nDevelopment of sustainable and safe infrastructure through ensuring proper planning, adequate resear ch \\nand optimum use of land for cost effective housing and planned urbanization.  \\nMajor Urban Development Functions  \\n\\uf0b7 Planning and undertaking of activities to solve housing problem of the country  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of architectural and structural design of public bu ildings and other infrastructure, their \\nconstruction and maintenance  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of laws and policies to promote housing sector  \\n\\uf0b7 Planned urbanization, proper use of land and development  \\n\\uf0b7 Undertaking activities to solve the accommodation problem of government  officers and staff  \\n\\uf0b7 Conducting research and innovate technology on urbanization, housing, construction of buildings, \\nconstruction materials and techniques  \\n\\uf0b7 Creation of opportunities for involvement of the private sector in solving urbanization and housing \\nproblems  with monitoring of customer delivery services and help enforcement of contracts.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n559 \\n Table 9. 9: Objectives, Activities and Implementing Agencies  \\nStrategic Objectives  Proposed Activities  Implementing  \\nDepartments/Agencies  \\nPlanned  \\nUrbanization  Formula te/modernize and implement Detailed Area \\nPlan, Master Plan and Structural Plan  RAJUK, CDA, KDA,  \\nPWD, RDA, CoxDA  \\nFormulate detailed area plan, master plan and  structural \\nplan for areas outside Rajuk, CDA,  KDA, and RDA  Urban Development  \\nDirectorate  \\nConst ruct link roads, flyovers, underpasses,  overpasses \\nand bypasses  PWD, RAJUK, CDA,  \\nKDA, RDA, CoxDA  \\nPreserve and develop open spaces, playgrounds, parks, \\nlakes, canals, water body  and implement green \\nprogrammes  PWD, RAJUK, CDA,  \\nKDA, RDA, CoxDA  \\nConstruct m ulti-storied car parking and multipurpose \\ncomplexes  RAJUK, CDA  \\nIdentify, preserve and remove unapproved  \\nand vulnerable buildings  PWD, RAJUK, KDA,  \\nRDA  \\n Introduction of Density Zoning Tool  RAJUK  \\nEnsuring  \\naffordable housing  \\nfor people of  \\ndifferent income  \\ngroups  Develop residential plots  NHA, RAJUK, CDA,  \\nRDA, CoxDA  \\nConstruct multi -storied residential buildings for sale on \\nrental -purchase basis  NHA, RAJUK, CDA,  \\nKDA, RDA, CoxDA  \\nConstruct, repair, and maintain residential buildings for \\ngovernment employees , dormitories/hostels for working \\nand job seeking women  PWD  \\nPrepare architecture for residential buildings for \\ngovernment employees, dormitories/hostels for working \\nand job seeking women  Department of  \\nArchitecture  \\nAllot flats to government employees  Directorate of Government  \\nAccommodation  \\nConstruct satellite towns under PPP  RAJUK  \\nInnovation of  \\ntechnology on  \\nplanned housing  and \\nconstruction  techniques  Conduct research and promotion of  low-cost eco -\\nfriendly housing technology  with the special emphasis \\non Autoclave Aerated Concrete (AAC) blocks  HBRI  \\nDisseminate house building technology and conduct \\ntesting and training  \\nConduct research on matters related to urban  \\nDevelopment  Urban Development  \\nDirectorate  \\nEnsuring  infrastructural  \\nfacilities befitti ng for \\nGovernmentactivities  Construct, repair and maintain infrastructures for \\nvarious departments under different ministries  PWD  \\nPrepare architecture for new buildings and infrastructure \\nfor ministries/divisions/departments  Department of  \\nArchitecture  \\n \\n    \\n \\n560 \\n Table 9.1 0: Priority Spending Areas/ Programmes  \\nPriority Spending Areas/ Programmes  Strategic Objectives  \\n1. Ensuring the optimum use of land in urban areas  \\nIn urban areas, it is extremely critical to protect lands from being used in an unplanned \\nway.

There is \\nalso a proposal from Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) to build an elevated expressway along the median \\nin this section.  \\nMiddle Ring Road  \\nThe alignment of the middle ring road is Hemayetpur - Kalakandi - 3rd Shitalakkhya Bridge - Madanpur - \\nBhulta (along Dhaka bypass) - Kodda (Gazipur) - Bypile (DEPZ) - Hemayetpur. RHD has signed a contract \\nwith China Joint Venture Company to construct 48 km Dhaka bypass (Joydebpur - Debugram - Bhulta - \\nMadanpur) in eastern side  by PPP which will be completed in September, 2022. The western side of Middle \\nRing Road (Hemayetpur - Kalakandi - 3rd Shitalakkhya Bridge - Madanpur) is under consideration for \\nconstruction with G2G on PPP basis with Marubeni Corporation of Japan. Mo st likely it will be at -  \\n \\n564 \\n grade.  On the other hand, BBA has completed a feasibility study for an expressway starting from Baliapur \\n(on Dhaka - Aricha Highway) along Nimtoli - Keraniganj - Fatullah - Bandar to Langalband (Dhaka - \\nChattogram Highway). It is under c onsideration to build by G2G with Malaysia.  \\nOuter Ring Road  \\nDhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) has taken steps to conduct a feasibility study for the \\nalignment.   \\n9.9.4 Development Results Framework (DRF) for the Urban Sector  \\nNational Priority  \\nSustainable and Inclusive Urban Development (SDG -11) \\nOutcome Statement  \\nReduced urban poverty and improved living conditions through planned, inclusive and sustainable \\nurbanization, better city governance, and improved infrastructure and service provisions  \\nTable 9.1 4: Sub -Sectoral Goals, Performance Indicators and Targets  \\nPerformance Indicator  Lead \\nMinistry/ \\nDivision  Baseline  \\n(Year)  Target  \\n(2021)  Target  \\n(2022)  Target  \\n(2023)  Target  \\n(2024)  Target  \\n(2025)  \\n1.

In the past ten years Government has opened up scope for the private sector to participate in \\ninvestment undertakings in the private sector. There is now an explicit role of private sector participation \\nin infrastructure finan cing in Government investment policy and its poverty reduction strategy. A large part \\nof the infrastructure projects for urban development would still require government interventions. These \\ninclude in particular those which have high social return but les s attractive to private investments. Such \\nprojects include water resource management, construction of physical infrastructures, roads and highways \\nand similar investment projects which would yield financial return in the very long run.  \\nLocal Government Res ources  \\nA key policy and institutional challenge for the 8FYP would be to sharply strengthen resource mobilization \\ncapacity of local governments through a system of well -planned fiscal decentralization. The required \\nreforms to implement fiscal decentralizat ion were discussed i n detail in Chapter 7, Part 2. As noted, all \\nUMICs have implemented substantial fiscal decentralization to empower local governments and hold them \\naccountable for improved service delivery. As Bangladesh approaches UMIC status, it will also initiate this \\nkey institutional reform.  Reforms will happen in the 8FYP, but full implementation will happen over the \\nnext 10 years. The 8FYP will initiate the following critical reforms:  \\n\\uf0b7 Block transfers will be provided to all LGIs, including urban LGIs, based on pre -determined criteria \\nthat will include  population, poverty, resource mobilization opportunities and performance.  Some \\npositive experience has already happened in the context of implementation of the LGSP projects.  \\n\\uf0b7 The property tax is the  main tax assigned to LGIs.  The tax will be modernized with proper valuation \\nof property and a reasonable rate in line will be updated on a 3 -year cycle with valuation changes spread \\nover a 3 -year period to ease the tax burden on the property owner.  \\n\\uf0b7 All L GIs will be required to implement full cost recovery of services provided.   \\nInfrastructure Project Financing by Private Sector  \\nThere is ample scope for private sector investment participation in a wide range of infrastructure projects. \\nGovernment has been  successful in wooing private investment in power projects, telecommunications, \\nairport maintenance and operation, toll bridge operation, land port development, small renewable energy \\nprojects, and other infrastructure projects. Government has now formulat ed mechanisms and incentives for \\ngreater participation of private infrastructure projects through the public private partnership modality. \\nAdditionally, Government has recently established clear guidelines on private sector investment in \\ninfrastructure pro jects.    \\n \\n567 \\n 9.9.6 Involving Local Stakeholders in Urban Development  \\nEffective partnerships between local governments and the private sector can generate considerable benefits. \\nPrivate companies, informal sector enterprises, CBOs, and NGOs can provide urban ser vices, mobilize \\nfinance (or voluntary labour), introduce innovative technologies and undertake land development activities. \\nFor involving private sector in urban development and management activities supportive legal framework \\nshould be developed and insti tutional setting should be ensured.  \\n9.9.7 Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation of Urban Development Activities  \\nMonitoring sound implementation of urban development activities is extremely important for assessment \\nof progress towards fulfilment of FYP and P P2041 targets. The Ministry of Local Government, Rural \\nDevelopment and Cooperatives can play a significant role in this regard. As emphasized by the PP2041, \\nThe Ministry can take the lead in defining and designing the national urban priorities and related urban \\nreforms and ensuring their proper implementation in close consultation and coordination with the urban \\nlocal governments. It will monitor progress with urbanization, identify emerging issues and challenges and \\nseek to resolve them in consultation wit h the concerned urban LGIs.  \\n9.10 DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR THE URBAN SECTOR DURING THE 8FYP  \\nSince urban sector is cross cutting involving many Ministries and Public Agencies, the ADP funding is \\nspread over several Ministries.  Most funding will come from the Loc al Government Division, the ADP \\nallocations for which were  provided in Chapter 7.  Most of the urban transport infrastructure will be funded \\nthrough the Ministry of Road Transport  & Bridges . Regarding housing and public works, much of housing \\nactivities ar e in the private sector. However, the Ministry of Housing & Public Works provides support to \\nlow cost housing schemes while the Development Authorities develop serviced land to facilitate urban \\nhousing. Taking into consideration the resource constraint and  based on the projected overall resource \\nenvelope and a careful assessment of relative expenditure priorities, development resources for Ministry of \\nHousing and Public Works are given in Table 9.1 5 below. These are only indicative figures to broadly \\nsuppor t achieving of the 8FYP strategic goals and objectives regarding development of the urban housing \\nsector in Bangladesh  \\nBangladesh is enjoying sustained robust growth that is leading to higher urbanization levels.  This has been \\ncreating new demand for urba n services, which has already been facing a backlog of unmet demand. The \\nresource needs are huge because there is already an existing backlog.  Therefore, creative measures will \\nhave to be undertaken to mobilize additional resources.  While improving colle ction of holding taxes, other \\ntaxes, user fees, levies etc. would be the usual revenue sources, there needs to be capacity building to \\nundertake PPP projects.  There also needs to be efforts to better leverage donor funding, particularly the \\nconcessional f unds from World Bank, ADB, Government of Japan or any other source, and preparing for \\nlong-term debt financing through issuing of bonds.  The allocation of development budget for the urban \\nsector is not limited within Ministry of Housing and Public Works bu t also under the local government \\ndevelopment (Chapter 7 of Part 2) to maintain consistency with the planning sectoral definition.  \\nRegarding housing and public works, much of housing activities are in the private sector.  However, the \\nHousing Ministry prov ides support to low cost housing schemes while the Rajuk develops serviced land to \\nfacilitate urban housing. Taking into consideration the resource constraint and based on the projected   \\n \\n568 \\n overall resource envelope and a careful assessment of relative expendi ture priorities, development resources \\nfor Ministry of Housing and Public Works are given in Table 9.1 5 and Table 9.1 6 below.  \\nTable 9.1 5: ADP Allocations for the Housing and Amenities in 8FYP  \\n(Taka Billion current prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024 FY2025  \\nMinistry of Housing and Public \\nWorks  42.8 52.7 60.8 70.9 85.1 \\nSector Total  42.8 52.7 60.8 70.9 85.1 \\n   Source: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 9.1 6: ADP Allocations for the Housing and Amenities in 8FYP  \\n(Taka Billion FY2021 constant  prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Housing and Public \\nWorks  42.8 50.0 54.9 61.0 69.9 \\nSector Total  42.8 50.0 54.9 61.0 69.9 \\n   Source:  Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 10:  \\nHEALTH  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n571 \\n CHAPTER 10 \\nHEALTH , POPULATION AND NUTRITION  \\n10.1 OVERVIEW  \\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as ‘ a state of complete physical, mental and social \\nwell-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.’ Alongside education and training, health is \\nnow univ ersally regarded as an important index of human development. Quality health care and effective \\npopulation management are very essential for ensuring sustained human development because of their huge \\npositive impact on the overall wellbeing of human in gene ral and on their labour productivity and rapid \\neconomic growth in particular. For this reason, the WHO recognized human health as one of the \\nfundamental human rights. Consistently in 1992, the United Nations declared that it endures that human \\nbeings are a t the center of concerns for sustainable development and they are entitled to a healthy and \\nproductive life in harmony with nature. Both the MDGs and SDGs uphold the importance of universal \\nhealth Coverage for sustained health and human development. Good h ealth plays pivotal roles in the \\nattainment of prosperous and happy livelihood by affecting human capitals such as educational attainment \\nand income -generating capacity.  \\nThe importance of human health for national development and welfare has been dramatic ally exposed by \\nthe ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. The fast -spread viral disease affected the entire world unaware, causing \\nmillions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. This has also led to a standstill in economic \\nactivities for a few months ca used by lockdown measures undertaken by countries to stem the spread of the \\nsdisease. Most of the countries affected by pandemic have slumped to an economic recession causing \\nmassive loss of income, output, investment, exports and government revenues. Impo rtantly, it has \\ndemonstrated that without security of human health, economic development can easily fall apart.  \\nBangladesh also has been affected  by the COVID -19 pandemic. The health system has come under \\ntremendous pressure and important gaps in health c are on both the supply and demand sides have emerged. \\nThe supply side constraints have shown up in terms of weak capabilities, inadequate physical facilities, lack \\nof emergency preparedness, shortage of manpower, critical supplies and materials, and unbala nced \\ndistribution of health care facilities across the country. On the demand side, the low capacity to pay for the \\npoor and lower middle class for emergency health care needs has emerged as a major constraint. In addition \\nto the pre -COVID -19 health challe nges, COVID -19 has exposed the need for strengthening the healthcare \\nsystem of Bangladesh and the need for Universal Healthcare financed through a combination of public and \\nprivate health insurance schemes.  \\nOn the population front, population arguably is t he most precious asset for a country. Proper harnessing of \\nthis asset is both a means to economic prosperity and end in itself, which is human welfare. History of \\neconomic development shows clearly that countries that have invested well and wisely in devel oping the \\npopulation have performed well on the development front. The debate on addressing population issues for \\ndevelopment emerged in the 1960s as a “numbers problem ”. There was a major concern about the high \\ngrowth of world population and the risks of overpopulation leading to economic and social miseries. It was \\nrecognized that proper management of population for development was not simply a task of lowering the   \\n \\n572 \\n growth of population through reduction in total fertility rates (TFR) but one of empowering  women to take \\ncontrol over their reproductive health and reproductive decisions as well as to ensure the management of \\nthe population by reducing the risks and enhancing  the quality of life at different stages of life cycle right \\nfrom the conception stage s to old age. This rethinking led to the landmark agreement on population \\nmanagement during the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo.  \\nThe health of a population is built on good nutrition. Adequate nutrition is the ba sis for a healthy life, and \\ncan prevent susceptibility to disease by improving the immune system. Good health entails the intake of \\nadequate and nutritious food. Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to \\ndisease, impaired phy sical and cognitive development, and reduced productivity. Similarly, population also \\ninfluences health through a number of ways. A large population adversely affects health resources, water \\nand sanitation facilities and food availability. From a policy pe rspective, the Health, Population and \\nNutrition (HPN) sector can be further broken down into the respective components, each meriting a \\nthorough analysis with detailed strategies and goals. However, it should be recognized that these three sub -\\nsectors are intricately related to each other, which raises the need to approach the HPN sector with a holistic \\npolicy framework that will allow the actions in one sub -sector to complement the actions in the others.  \\nEffective outputs in the HPN sector depends upon av ailability of resources, coordination, good planning, \\neffective implementation and monitoring with proper accountability of the relevant agencies working on \\nhealth, population and nutrition.  \\n10.2 HEALTH SECTOR PROGRESS DURING 7FYP  \\nBangladesh has been followin g a Sector -Wide Approach (SWAp) in the HPN sector since 1998. The sector \\nwide approach (SWAp) is an approach that brings together the Government, development partners (DPs) \\nand other stakeholders within a single sector policy and expenditure program, under  Government \\nleadership, adopting common approaches across the sector, and progressing towards relying on \\nGovernment procedures to disburse and account for all funds. However, Bangladesh health SWAp excludes \\nthe public sector health interventions implemente d outside the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare \\n(MoHFW) (i.e. by MoLGRDC, MoSW, MoWCA, MoCHTA, etc.). But, the MoHFW has been \\ncontinuously trying to strengthen its coordination and functional relationship with other \\nstakeholders/Ministries/Agencies inv olved in providing health services.  \\nThe first SWAp  known as ‘Health and Population Sector Program (HPSP)’ (1998 –2003), was implemented \\nwith a focus to decentralize the delivery of the essential service package (ESP) of primary health care (PHC) \\nusing a ‘o ne-stop’ service model, to deliver basic health and family planning (FP) services to rural \\ncommunities. The second SWAp,  titled as ‘Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP) was \\nimplemented during 2003 –2011 with the objective of increasing th e availability and utilization of user -\\ncentered, effective, efficient, equitable, affordable and accessible quality HPN services. In 2011, the third \\nSWAp  titled the ‘Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program (HPNSDP) was \\nimplemented for t he period July 2011 to December 2016 with a focus on strengthening health systems and \\nimproving health and FP services. The Fourth Health, Population and Nutrition and Sector Program (4th \\nHPNSP)  covering the period from January 2017 to June 2022 has taken a holistic approach, which is unique \\nin terms of its focus on (a) strengthening MoHFW’s governance and stewardship roles in the HPN sector; \\n(b) strengthening systems/ institutions for efficient service delivery; and (c) expanding HPN services and \\nemphasizi ng service quality both in public and private sectors. The fourth SWAp – the 4th HPNSP - has   \\n \\n573 \\n also been aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and is the first of the three successive \\nphases in realizing the SDGs and achieving universal healt h coverage (UHC) by 2030. As the Government \\ncontinued the SWAp in the 7th Five Year Plan period, the same modality will be followed during the 8th \\nFive Year Plan for the HPN sector development.  \\nAll the SWAps including the current SWAp (4th HPNSP) laid high  focus on pro -poor ESP, which \\ncontributed to the promotion of equity through reduction of the gap between rich and poor with respect to \\nhealth outcomes in rural areas. While achievement against some of the indicators is satisfactory in general, \\nthere are p ockets of underachievers geographically – which are linked to the socio -cultural as well as \\ntopographic features of the given areas. The Mission of the 4th HPNSP is to create conditions whereby the \\npeople of Bangladesh have the opportunity to reach and mai ntain the highest attainable level of health. The \\ngoal is to ensure quality and equitable health care and nutrition services for all citizens by improving access \\nto and utilization of health, under two main components. The first component aims to improve h ealth \\nservices, such as maternal and child health and nutrition, Family planning, Reproductive health, Adolescent \\nhealth, Non -communicable diseases, TB  etc. and support the service delivery system including primary \\nhealth care. The second component focuses  on strengthening health systems such as governance and human \\nresources.  \\nOverall, there has been good progress in improving health outcomes. Formulation and implementation of \\nnational health, nutrition and population policies along with maternal, neonatal  and child health strategies, \\netc. are some milestone achievements in improving HPN service delivery in Bangladesh. Community based \\nhealth care service provision helped increasing access of poor women to health services. Strengthening of \\nhealth MIS through  digitalization and the fiduciary capacity of MoHFW is noteworthy. Moreover, \\nimprovements in procurement, budget planning, sector coordination and management, fund absorption \\ncapacity, monitoring and supportive development of overall socio -economic conditi ons have contributed \\nto reduction in NMR, IMR, U -5MR, MMR, TFR, malnutrition, stunting, under -weight, etc. and have \\nresulted in increasing life expectancy at birth, thereby creating a platform for a population with better health \\nand a prosperous society.  \\nCommitment from the government for achieving universal health coverage (UHC) and for that, efforts are \\non to bringing primary health care (PHC) service close to the communities through provision of care from \\na single service delivery point. Mainstreaming o f nutrition services through the regular government \\nchannels made service provision more cost -effective and led to improved coordination at different stages \\nof service delivery including at the Community Clinics  (CCs) . The implementation of CC and UH&FWC \\nbased programmes  have contributed to increasing access of the poor especially the women to HPN services. \\nUpdating of essential service package (ESP) and its expansion up to district hospital levels from the 4th \\nHPNSP period has also been contributing to inc reased access of HPN services by the poor.  \\nRevitalizing and making the CCs functional with adequate manpower, equipment and medicines from 2010 \\nis another milestone achievement. Approval of Health Financing Strategy (2012 -2030) and the National \\nSocial Secu rity Strategy (NSSS) 2015 by the Government demonstrates high commitment for improving \\nhealth of the population through sustainable financing. There has also been considerable recruitment of \\ndoctors, nurses, midwives, field level health and family planning  workers, etc. with vacancy rates declining \\nto around 15% in 2018 from above 20% level in 2011 .   \\n \\n574 \\n In line with the approaches envisaged in the 7th Five Year Plan of Bangladesh, monitoring and evaluation \\nmechanism of the HPN sector has been developed based on  results.

Under -five mortality rate has persistently declined from 36 per 1,000 live births in 2015 to \\n28 in 2019 (SVRS, 2019), that already achieved the SDG target of 2025. On the other hand, the neo -natal \\nmortality rate (NMR) decreased to 15/1,000 live births in 2019 from 20 in 2015; that also achieved the SDG \\ntarget of 2025.  \\nPrevalence of HIV/AIDS (all ages) has been very low in Bangladesh (<0.01 for all ages  and 0.015  for adults  \\nbetween  15-49 years  per 1,000 uninfected populations, UNAIDS, 2018 ). The incidence rate of tuberculosis \\n(TB) has been reduced to 221 in 2019 (WHO, 2019) from 225 per 1,00,000 in 2015 (WHO, 2015). The \\nNational TB Program (NTP) of Bangladesh along with its partners has been maintaining basic TB control \\nservices with reasonable case detection and excellent treat ment outcomes.    \\n \\n575 \\n Malaria incidence per 1000 population was 2.99 in 2015 (National Malaria Elimination Programme -NMEP, \\n2015), which has also been declining. The incidence rate decreased to 0.92 in 2018 (NMEP, 2018). The \\ngovernment interventions in collaborat ion with the Development Partners and NGOs for malaria \\neradication resulted in a decline in incidence nationally.  \\nThere is a huge burden of the Neglected Tropical diseases (NTDs) in Bangladesh, particularly for Kala -\\nazar; Lymphatic Filariasis; and Dengue;  etc. The progress regarding the indicator, “number of people \\nrequiring interventions against NTD” has been increased from about 50 million (WHO, 2016) to about \\n56.33 million (World Health Statistics, WHO, 2020). By 2030 it needs to be reduced to 35.0 mill ion and \\nefforts are on through various interventions such as integrated vector management; promotion of clinical \\nmanagement; and active engagement of the communities; etc. for reducing NTDs.  \\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) have now formed major share of t he overall disease burden and \\nmortality. Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease \\nwas 21.6 in 2016 and the situation is unchanged since then (World Health Statistics, WHO, 2020). \\nAwareness program mes on helpful behavioral patterns, changing dietary habits, lifestyle change, etc. are \\nbeing implemented for preventing NCDs and facility readiness including training of doctors are going on \\nfor better treatment of NCD patients.   \\nHSD is implementing anti -tobacco program based on WHO - FCTC and Tobacco Control Law of \\nBangladesh. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2018 found that prevalence of tobacco uses among \\npersons aged 15 years and older had decreased from 43.3% in 2009 to 35.3% in 2017, among whom  46.0% \\nare men and 25.2% are women. Awareness raising activities against tobacco use are being implemented \\ncontinuously.  \\nBangladesh has developed an effective national immunization program starting from 1979 with the \\nimplementation of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Proportion of target population (≤12 -\\nmonth -old children) covered by all vaccines increased from 78% (BDHS, 2014) to 86% (BDHS, 2017 -18). \\nIt needs to be increased to 98% by 2025 and further to 100% by 2030. The Mid -Term Review of the 4th \\nHPNSP conduc ted in 2020 thereby advised to integrate Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP) into the \\nEPI platforms.  \\nThere has been considerable recruitment of doctors, nurses, midwives, field level health and family \\nplanning workers, etc. with vacancy rates declining t o around 15% in 2018 from the above 20% level in \\n2011. Health worker density was 7.4 per 10,000 populations (WHO, 2016) and the distribution of physician: \\nnurse: health technologist was 1:0.5:0.2 (HRH Data sheet, 2014, MoHFW). The density has been increase d \\nto 9.9 per 10,000 populations (Health SDG Profile, Bangladesh, WHO, 2020) and1:0.6:0.3 (HRH Data \\nSheet, 2019, MoHFW)..   Moreover, since 2019 some 41 public nursing institutions and colleges and 28 \\nprivate institutions have been in operation. The introdu ction of the Midwifery cadre reflects an important \\npolicy milestone that has supported the needs of maternal, neonatal and reproductive health, especially in \\nthe rural areas.  This has been an important contributor to reducing maternal and neonatal deaths and also \\nhas led to a reduction in birth -related complications and recovery.  \\nMedical Education and Family Welfare Division (MEFWD) leads two indicators related to universal access \\nto family planning, reproductive and adolescent health, it has profound impl ications on achieving other \\nindicators like maternal mortality and child mortality. Family planning can reduce MMR by 30%, neonatal   \\n \\n576 \\n mortality by 20%, unintended pregnancy to more than 66% and abortion by 40%. Currently, the proportion \\nof women of reproduct ive age (aged 15 -49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with \\nmodern methods is 77.4% according to BBS (MICS 2019), MEFWD is working hard to increase to 100% \\nwithin 2030. On the other hand, adolescent birth rate (aged 10 -19 years) per 1 ,000 women in that age group \\nis 74 according to SVRS 2018, MEFWD also has taken huge activities to reduce it to 50 per 1000 \\nadolescents within 2030. MEFWD also acts as co -lead for 7 indicators, and as associate for 13 indicators \\nof SDG -3. MEFWD has key act ive role to achieve other health related SDG targets such as prevalence of \\nstunting among children under 5 years of age, proportion of wasting and overweight of children under the \\nage of 5 years, maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births), proporti on of birth attended by skilled \\nhealth personnel, reduce under five mortality rate (per 1,000 live births), reduce neo -natal mortality rate \\n(per 1000 live births) and universal health coverage. MEFWD conducted divisional level workshops \\nfocusing on SDG rel ated activities for enhancing knowledge and understanding of the stakeholders with \\nkey concepts and principles along with targets and indicators of the health related SDGs, matching those \\nwith field level program activities.  \\n10.2.2  Progress of 4th HPNSP  \\nThe Government approved the 4th Health, Population and Nutrition Sector Programme (4th HPNSP) in \\nMarch 2017 for implementation during January 2017 – June 2022 with an estimated cost of USD 14.7 \\nbillion, 84% of which will be financed from Government’s own r esources. Of the 29 Operational Plans \\n(OP) under the current 4th HPNSP, 19 OPs fall under the HSD in the areas of hospital services management; \\ncommunity based health and nutrition services; maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health care; \\nnutrition service delivery; communicable and non -communicable diseases control; HR development; \\nplanning, monitoring and sector management; HIS and eHealth; health education and promotion of lifestyle \\nchanges; procurement, storage and supply management; etc. Besides , 38 discrete projects are being \\nimplemented.  \\nThe 4th HPNSP has been continuing to expand services and improve health systems through implementation \\nof the strategies like capacity building, stronger governance for better quality services; greater function al \\ncoordination of services at the field level; partnerships with the private sector and the community; \\nimprovement in quality of care; comprehensive health workforce strategy and action plan; increased \\ninvestment in prevention and primary care of public h ealth; the rising burden of NCDs through cross -sector \\ninterventions on public health awareness and healthy lifestyles and healthy environment; tackling \\nestablished and new communicable diseases; strengthening surveillance, data quality and information \\nsystems; and increasing investment in health.  \\nProgress of new funding modality : The financing of the 4th HPNSP by the World Bank (WB) is under a \\nnew results -based financing modality known as Investment Project Financing (IPF) with Disbursement -\\nLinked Indicato rs (DLIs). Disbursement of US$ 588.45 million by the WB and other DPs is to be made \\nupon annual achievement of specifically defined Disbursement -Linked Results (DLRs) with targets \\ncovering a total of 16 DLIs. The Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Di vision (IMED) of the \\nGovernment has been engaged as the Independent Verification Agency (IVA) for verification of the DLRs.  \\n   \\n \\n577 \\n The MoHFW formed a DLI Monitoring Committee in order to monitor progress towards achievement of \\nDLIs, support the line directors ( LDs) in implementation and produce reports to be submitted for \\nverification by the IMED. The Committee comprises of representatives from the concerned departments of \\nthe two Divisions (i.e. HSD and MEFWD), the World Bank and the other DPs. The Planning Win g in \\ncollaboration with the WB also organized two workshops to orient the relevant LDs on year -wise targets \\nand significance of achievement of DLRs, evidence, reporting requirements and verification method. \\nDuring  January 2017 –June 2019, the disbursement for achieving the results was supposed to be US$ 275.99 \\nmillion, but an actual amount of US$ 140.19 million was received by GOB, meaning an achievement rate \\nof 51%. Achieving this rate is noteworthy as the funding modality is a new one to the implementers of \\nMoHFW and also new to IMED with respect to verification of DLIs. However, all the players involved – \\nconcerned LDs, MOHFW, IMED and the WB – have to play their part to cover up the disbursement gap.  \\nNutritional Issues: Malnutrition (including anemia) i s a major concern in Bangladesh. Good progress has \\nhappened between 2007 and 2019. More specifically, m alnutrition has been reducing over the past decades \\nand stunting (height -for-age) of children decreased from 43% in 2007 to 28% in 2019, while during the  \\nsame period, the proportion of underweight (weight -for-age) children decreased from 41% to 22.6%; \\nwasting also decreased from 17% to 9.8% (MICS, 2019). Moreover, the Exclusive Breastfeeding Rate \\nincreased from 55% in 2014 to 65% in 2017, consumption of a Minimum Acceptable Diet (MAD) has \\nincreased from 21.2% to 34.1%, and Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) from 24.25% to 37.5% during the \\nsame period. These are outstanding achievements at any point of time and indicate social transformation of \\nthe Bangladeshis .  \\n10.2.3  Progress in Tackling Inequality in Health  \\nHSD is implementing a pilot social health protection scheme in three upazilas known as “Shasthyo \\nShuroksha Karmasuchi (SSK) under which free hospital services are being provided to the poor - below \\npoverty  level (BPL) card holders, which are contributing to reducing inequity in health. The Maternal \\nHealth Voucher Scheme (MHVS) in operation in 55 upazilas is another health protection scheme, the \\nbeneficiaries of which are poor and vulnerable pregnant women. Specified services under this scheme are \\nprovided by designated providers and facilities from the public and the private sectors as well as the NGOs \\nfor ensuring safe delivery of the poor mothers.  \\nThe Community Clinics (CCs) have provided a woman -friendly  platform where about 95% of service \\nseekers are women and children availing various PHC services near their home. The CC based model is \\nalso an example of participation and accountability of local communities in health service delivery (e.g. \\ncommunity sup port groups and community groups for management of the CCs).  \\nHowever, there are still other equity issues involving geographical, ethnic, gender and different forms of \\nmarginalization. Gradual expansion of service coverage in the hard -to-reach (HTR) areas , effective \\nimplementation of ethnic minority health plan and health workforce management, etc. activities programmed \\nunder the 4th HPNSP for addressing inequity issues, will be continued during the 8FYP  as well.  \\n   \\n \\n578 \\n 10.2.4  Progress in Approaches to Universal  Health Care (UHC)  \\nBangladesh had always prioritized a focus on making public health services available and accessible to all \\nits citizens since, at least, the last three decades –through Health for All (HFA), Primary Health Care (PHC), \\nEssential Service Pa ckage (ESP), etc. The ESP, being implemented from the levels of CCs to district \\nhospitals as priority intervention for providing PHC services, represents Government’s commitment to \\nensure the right to health and nutrition and that the whole population has access to the most essential health \\nand nutrition services. The CC based service provision at the doorstep of the people is a step forward \\ntowards achieving the UHC. The CCs are also contributing to reducing the gap between rich and poor with \\nrespect to he alth outcomes in rural areas.  \\nThe 4th HPNSP has been serving as the first, and the foundation, of three subsequent SWAps and is aligned \\nto the goal of achieving UHC by 2030, which highlights the right of every citizen to gain access to quality \\nhealth care (whether these are obtained from the public or private) without incurring economic hardship. \\nThe WHO in its Progress Review Report on SDGs (2020) assessed that Bangladesh achieved a score of \\n53% on a UHC index of essential health services, which was 50% in  2017.  \\nProgress in Family Planning: There has been progress in other FP indicators as well. The population \\ngrowth rate has now been reduced to 1.32% in 2019 from 1.37% in 2015 (SVRS 2019). There has also \\nbeen reduction in dropout rates and unmet needs  which stood at  37% and 12% respectively (BDHS 2017 -\\n18). The proportion of women of reproductive age (Age 15 - 49 years) who have their need for FP satisfied \\nwith modern method has increased to 77.4% (MICS, 2019) from 72.6% (SVRS 2014). Antenatal care rate \\nhas increased from 31.2% in 2014 to 47% in 2018 and post -natal care has also increased from 33.9% in \\n2014 to 52.1% in 2018 (BDHS 2017 -18). Household data of about one crore population had been collected \\nand stored through the Population Registration System (PR S). Some of the mentionable FP activities are \\npopularization of long acting permanent methods and increasing the use of contraceptives, providing \\nclinical contraception and maternal, child and reproductive health services, BCC for awareness raising, etc.  \\nDuring the implementation of 7FYP, the Government reorganized and upgraded the Directorate of Nursing \\nService into the Directorate General of Nursing & Midwifery (DGNM) on 6 November, 2016 in order to \\nstrengthen, modernize and speed up the development programmes  related to nursing education and \\nservices, and making the nurses more effective in discharging their responsibilities. The Nursing Council \\nhas also been reconstructed into Bangladesh Nursing & Midwifery Council (BNMC). The DGNM has been \\nstrengthened  with additional 77 new positions including one Director General and an Additional Director \\nGeneral. 3,000 posts of Midwives have been created. 3 -years diploma course in midwifery is now in \\noperation in 38 public nursing institutions. Web -based Masters in midwifery course is also being run. Of \\nparticular note is the development of Midwifery policy, accreditation of Midwifery educational institute, \\nintroduction of quality midwifery educational system, development of dedicated midwifery faculty, \\nintroduction of Midwife led maternal and newborn care, quality licensing examination for the midwife, \\ncreation of post in addition to existing post. This policy is particularly helpful to improve access of the rural \\npopulation to trained birth support staff that is so critical to prevent birth complications and reduce maternal \\nmortality rates.  \\n   \\n \\n579 \\n There have been improvements in the availability of medical educational institutions (universities, colleges, \\ndental units, nursing colleges, nursing and midwifery institutes, MA Ts, IHTs) both in the public and private \\nsectors, raising the number from 190 in 2009 to 786 in 2018. During the same period, number of seats in \\nthese medical institutions has increased from 17,105 to 53,473.  \\nThe MEFWD has also been strengthened training a nd research activities through NIPORT by establishing \\nregional population training institutes and providing continuous training to the service providers of DGFP, \\nDGHS, DGME, DGNM and others. In 2018 -19, NIPORT provided in -service training to 36,197 program  \\nmanagers, service providers and field staff. NIPORT has developed Digital Registration System to link it \\nto Training Management System and also completed Bangladesh Health Facility Survey, 2017 and \\nBangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2017 -18. \\n10.3 CHALLE NGES OF THE HPN SECTOR  \\nEven before COVID -19, the Government has been facing changing health sector challenges due to \\nexistence of dynamic characteristics as the population has been changing in age stratification, demand -\\nsupply situation due to income chang e, unabated rural -urban migration and rapidly increasing urban \\npopulation, epidemiological changes, and changes in medical technology, research and innovations, etc. \\nSome of the major challenges are as follows.  \\n1. Childhood, adolescent and maternal malnutriti on have been decreasing slowly, however, there is still a \\nlong way to go for the overall improvement of the nutritional situation in Bangladesh. Only 65% of \\nchildren below 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed and 34% of children 6 -23 months aged are \\nfed with appropriate feeding practices (BDHS -2017 -18). Micronutrient deficiencies among the children \\nand women of reproductive age are still a challenge. Unsafe food has been long standing challenge in \\nthe country and poses a serious public health risk lead ing to increased prevalence of food borne \\ndiseases. Hygiene and sanitation standards still remain unsatisfactory and the caregivers rarely wash \\ntheir hands before feeding the children.  \\n2. There is a concern  about the non -communicable diseases like diabetes, cardio -vascular diseases and \\ncancer, which have become leading causes of morbidity and mortality . The are also related to poor \\nnutrition practices and overnutrition related to lifestyle changes and increased consumption of food \\nwith high levels of salt, su gar, and fat. Moreover, a number of new health challenges are emerging, \\nwhich include: increasing incidence of injuries including acid and burn injuries , drowning and road \\ntraffic injuries; ageing and geriatric diseases; the spread of infectious diseases s uch as TB, Dengue, \\nChikungunya, Hepatitis B and C, COVID -19 etc. as well as emerging and re -emerging diseases; \\ntreating severe and acute malnutrition and the health effects of geo -climatic disasters.  \\n3. Many challenges still remain in the service delivery ar eas of ensuring skilled attendance at birth, \\naddressing the epidemiological transition and the double burden of communicable and non -\\ncommunicable diseases - including detection, prevention and control of emerging and reemerging \\ndiseases, improving overall n utritional situation, improving quality and safety of food and drugs, \\nproviding adequate health response to gender -based violence, improving health care for mental and \\nneurological disorders and geriatric population, service expansion to hard -to-reach (HTR ) areas, \\nassuring quality of care, etc.    \\n \\n580 \\n 4. The engagement of the MoHFW  in environmental health and climate change issues is of recent origin. \\nChildren, women and elderly people are likely to be more affected by the environmental health hazards. \\nIncreasing sa linity in the coastal belt areas due to climate change is posing threat to increased water -\\nborne related morbidity and mortality. The complex relationship between environmental factors, \\nclimate change and human health warrants re -prioritization of public h ealth interventions to achieve \\nnational and global objectives for improved health status under the SDG agenda.  \\n5. Expansion of city areas and expanding coverage of city corporations and municipalities up to upazila \\nlevel, rural -urban migration and a rising u rban population pose new threats for effective urban primary \\nhealth care (PHC) service delivery. Rapidly increasing demand for urban primary health care and \\nnutrition services; and prevention and control of NCDs continue to remain as challenges during the \\nSDGs period. With the demographic transition taking place it has become urgent to review the present \\nurban health and nutrition services delivery arrangement and take measures to expand coverage and \\nimprove quality, keeping in view the needs of the urban p oor. \\n6. Continuously rising per capita out -of-pocket expenditure (from 64% in 2012 to 67% in 2015, this could \\nhave been raised further in recent times) has been pushing the affected lower income and poor people \\nto hardship, thus creating hindrances to achievi ng UHC by 2030. According to WHO, 24.7% people \\nsuffer the pressure of catastrophic health expenses and a family has to spend 10% of total family \\nexpenses on health. Although Bangladesh has made laudable progress in reducing poverty, every year \\n7% people ar e going down the poverty line for meeting health care expenses. So, reducing out -of-\\npocket expenditure is a huge challenge.  \\n7. Availability of yearly data on output/outcome level indicators of the SDGs also remains as a challenge. \\nOther specific challenges ar e shortage of human resources at all stages of health services, regulating \\nthe private sector clinics and diagnostic centres for maintaining their service quality and bringing in \\nuniformity in urban health services in the city corporation areas.  \\n8. There are  issues of inadequate and ineffective service delivery in the hilly, char and the coastal areas \\nwhere provision of human resources remains a problem. Settlements in those areas are quite dispersed \\ndue to geographical reasons making it difficult for service  seekers to access facilities miles apart.  \\n9. Major inequities in health and nutrition outcomes still exist and need to be addressed. In general, \\nwomen, adolescent girls and children have less access to health care and their health status is relatively \\nworse  than their male counterparts, even though continuous efforts are on -going to address the issue of \\nhealth inequity. There are inequities in the distribution of health benefits by income groups and by \\ngeographical location.  \\n10. There are several institutional issues that require attention. These include: quality assurance of health \\ncare facilities  through proper accreditation; ensuring availability of skilled human resource (HR) based \\non an effective and efficient Health Workforce Strategy (HWS); utilizing ful l capacity of the existing \\nand upgraded public facilities at the district and Upazila level; strengthening governance, stewardship \\nand regulatory functions; mobilizing more resources for the HPN sector efficient and effective use of \\nbudget including a prop er balance between new facilities and adequacy of materials and supplies; and \\nretaining skilled health service staff in rural areas;    \\n \\n581 \\n 11. Bangladesh has a large public health service network covering field -based domiciliary services and \\nfacilities at different levels like villages, unions, upazilas, districts, divisions, and several specialized \\nhospitals. To fully utilize the potential of such a vast network is a big challenge. Recognizing the \\nchallenge, the Government has undertaken programmes  under the 7FYP  to address many of them.  \\n10.3.1  Challenges in Medical Education and FP Services  \\n\\uf0b7 Shortage of human resources in all stages of medical education, nursing and FP services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring quality in the training of doctors, nurses, midwives and medical assistants.  \\n\\uf0b7 Regulating the medical education institutions of the private sector and maintaining their teaching \\nquality.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing use of modern methods of contraception and reducing dropouts and unmet needs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reducing the rate of early marriage and subsequent early pr egnancy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Bringing in uniformity in FP services in the city corporation areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Limited availability of Post -Partum Family Planning, Post MR/MRM, PAC -FP services in District \\nHospitals, Medical Colleges Hospital, Private Hospitals and Upazilla Health Complexe s;   \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate Social Behavioral Change Communication (BCC) activities for motivating and referral \\nof LARC & PM services by field level workers;  \\n\\uf0b7 Shortage of skilled Doctors and paramedics to provide LARC & PM, PPFP services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of Quality of Care like -clinical Supervision & monitoring by the managers and supervisors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Family Planning curriculum of different level medical education is not updated according to \\nnational family planning program.   \\n\\uf0b7 Readiness of FP Service Facilities: only 25% of the public facilities that offer FP services are ready \\nto provide quality FP services; Half of the NGO facilities were found to be ready; in private sector \\n5% facilities are ready to offer quality FP services (BUFS,2014)  \\n\\uf0b7 Shortage of Human Resources: The vacancy situ ation is high in facilities located in hard -to-reach \\nareas, including coastal belt, chars, hill tracts, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 To increase long acting & permanent method of contraceptives: Only 8% LARC acceptors;  \\n\\uf0b7 To increase male participation in CPR: almost 90% users are  female  \\n\\uf0b7 Early marriage, early child bearing and low contraceptive use among young married couple  \\n\\uf0b7 To address slum & urban areas for family planning activities and to reduce dropout rate & unmet \\nneed for family planning  \\n\\uf0b7 Fragmented MIS: Urban service data ar e insufficient and not properly linked.  \\n\\uf0b7 Menstrual Regulation (MR) and Post -Abortion Care (PAC) Services: Information on MR and PAC \\nis not readily available in health facilities, especially regarding post -MR care.  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate Family Planning/back -up service s for disable people, during disaster and emergency \\nsituations;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase the percentage of Institutional Deliveries with a focus to union level facilities where 24/7 \\nservices are established.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of effective monitoring system at all levels for  digitalization.  \\n\\uf0b7 Data gap prevails due to vacancy at service delivery points (SDP).    \\n \\n582 \\n 10.3.2  COVID -19 Challenge and Bangladesh’s Responses  \\nBangladesh took quick action to address the risks posed by COVID -19. Bangladesh adapted following \\n“Whole of Governme nt Approach” to ensure interactive process among all Ministries and to achieve the \\nbest results though openness, sharing information and cooperation amongst all concerned. MoHFW \\ninitiated necessary preparation since January 2020 to control and contain the pandemic and prepared \\n“Bangladesh Preparation and Response Plan (BPRP) for COVID -19 as a living document. The National \\nGuidelines on Clinical Management of COVID -19 was also prepared on the basis of latest evidence and \\nthe WHO guidelines to be followed by every clinic/hospital, for treating COVID -19 ‘confirmed’, \\n‘probable’, or ‘suspect’ cases.  \\nFrom the very beginning, the Hon’ble Prime Minister has been overseeing the national response and taking \\nfeedback from the grassroots represented by government offic ials and political leaders and different \\nstakeholders through videoconferencing. The MoHFW, under guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister, has \\ntaken all -out efforts to prevent and control spread of COVID -19 as well as to provide health care services \\nto the infe cted people. A National Committee headed by the Minister of Health and Family Welfare was \\nconstituted to take necessary steps for the prevention and control of corona virus. Besides, committees had \\nbeen formed at City Corporation, municipality, district, U pazila, and union levels. Some existing public \\nhospitals have been made ready to provide specialized services for corona virus patients and more hospitals \\nare being prepared. In addition to government hospitals, a number of private sector hospitals are inv olved \\nin testing and treatment of corona virus. The country has been implementing the response activities with \\nthe multi -sectoral involvement representing the relevant ministries/divisions, private sectors, development \\npartners through a pillar -based multi -sectoral coordination mechanism. The other major actions taken to \\ncontain the COVID -19 pandemic are as follows - \\n\\uf0b7 A novel Community Support Team (CST) intervention was piloted so that individuals with \\nsymptoms could be evaluated and those who meet the clini cal criteria are isolated at home with \\ntheir families with the full support of rapid response. The CSTs are comprised of MoHFW \\nCommunity Clinic, BRAC community health, available medical students, intern doctors, staff and \\nvolunteers. The CST has also been facilitating access to hospital care for those who develop a \\nsevere disease.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 MoHFW has rapidly implemented community -based prevention practices, case identification, and \\nquarantining utilizing local community health capacity for slowing the spread of dise ase following \\nlockdown. Immediate action was taken to procure PPE, hospital equipment and supplies required \\nto expand care of critically ill and severe patients.  \\nBesides, healthcare workers’ training programmes were initiated for improving infection \\npreven tion control and case management. Also, risk communication and community engagement \\nhas been focused on encouraging the spirit of solidarity, empowering individuals and communities \\nto stop the spread of COVID -19 through behavioral change, informed individu al decisions and \\ncollective community action.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 MoHFW recruited additional 5000 nurses, 2000 medical doctors and expanded the diagnostic \\ncapacity to 91 laboratories. Healthcare worker trainings were conducted  for improving infection \\nprevention control and case management skills of the frontline health care providers. Testing   \\n \\n583 \\n capacity has been expanded and s ome other measures have been taken for public health \\nmanagement at designated Points of Entry. Necessary measures were taken to prevent and control \\nsprea d of Covid -19 in the camps of forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals located at Cox’s Bazar \\ndistrict.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 IEDCR has always been updating the information of COVID -19 in their website. A COVID -19 \\ndashboard has also been developed by MIS, DGHS and is updated daily . In response to COVID -\\n19, Government has increased capacity of mhealth services “Shastho Batayon 16263”. Shastho \\nBatayon 16263 is an online application where general people are able to get 24/7 health services.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Preparedness for procurement of vaccines h as also been completed with detailed vaccination plan \\nto cover 80% of the total population in phases.   \\nResponse strategy for tackling the COVID -19 \\nSome key strategies to limit spread of corona virus and to reduce pressure on the national health systems.ar e \\nhighlighted as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 Enforcement of compulsory mask -wearing and safe hygiene practices outside the home, including \\nwithin the workplace, school and, public transport.  \\n\\uf0b7 Zoning approach to containment of the spread of corona virus is being followed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Com munity -based prevention practices, case identification, and quarantining utilizing local \\ncommunity health capacity will be continued to tackle the virus.  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintaining communication and liaison with relevant countries and institutions for timely \\nprocurement  of vaccines.  \\n\\uf0b7 Use of digital platform for slowing spread of disease and sustaining behavior change following \\nlockdown.  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintenance of social distancing regulations based on latest expert and industry guidance as developed \\nby MoHFW and to be enforced by hi gher-level committees.  \\n\\uf0b7 Empowerment of frontline health workers and other essential workers through BCC training   to make \\nthem agents of change to turn the epidemic around and address their potential COVID -19 related fears \\nand concerns.  \\n\\uf0b7 Continuous use of e lectronic and print media for raising awareness of mass people in hand washing, \\nmask wearing, maintaining social distance, other safe hygiene practices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing necessary funds to tackle the COVID pandemic. In addition to providing increased \\nbudgetary al location, a block amount of Tk. 10,000 crore (approximately USD 1176.5 million) has \\nbeen earmarked in the FY 2020 -21 budget to address the issues related to corona virus pandemic. \\nEfforts will be continued to mobilize more resources from Development Partne rs (DPs) to finance \\nBPRP 2020, etc.  \\n10.4 8FYP GOALS, STRATEGIES AND TARGETS FOR THE HPN SECTOR  \\nBangladesh aim s to attain a number of targets in the road towards universal health coverage, consistent with \\nthe proposed major targets under the proposed UN Sustaina ble Development Goals (SDG) framework. \\nPromoting and sustaining health and nutrition along with containing population growth are priorities in the \\nhuman development strategy. Vision 2041 envisions a High -income Bangladesh with no poverty and with   \\n \\n584 \\n condition s that allows individuals to reach and maintain the highest attainable level of health. It incorporates \\nappropriate strategies and activities for focused improvements in health service delivery for increasing \\naccess to, and quality of care and improving eq uity along  with financial protection in order to meaningfully \\nrealize the objectives of universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030. At present, Bangladesh does not have \\nadequate health insurance scheme that has made it very difficult for the poor and lower mi ddle class to \\nfinance any health shock. Both issues will be given top priority in the 8FYP.  \\nGoal:  The goal is to ensure that all citizens enjoy health and well -being by expanding access to quality and \\nequitable health care in a healthy environment.  \\nObject ive:  The main objective is to build on existing achievement to improve equity,  quality and efficiency \\nwith a view to gradually moving towards UHC and achieving  the HPN related SDGs.  \\nTargets:   Past and ongoing programmes have promoted good health, nutriti on while managing population \\ngrowth. In order to carry on with the progress achieved and address areas of deficiency, some of the specific \\ntargets for the HPN sector under the 8FYP are shown in Table 10.2.  \\nTable 10.2: Health, Population and Nutrition Targe ts for the 8FYP  \\nSl.

In this context, take into account the changing needs of people as they age, as well as the \\ndifferent needs of children, women and men; internal and international migrants; and rural and \\nurban populations; etc . \\n\\uf0b7 Provide targeted health support to the most socially and economically disadvantaged and \\nvulnerable populations, including those affected by climate change and natural disasters; and help \\nto strengthen their resilience to social, economic and environmenta l shocks.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide universal access to reproductive and maternal health care as well as NCDC, HIV/AIDS \\nprevention, treatment, care and support.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide higher coverage and adequate levels of health care including social protections, and ensure \\na balanced di stribution of the human and financial costs of care.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop appropriate technologies, care services and infrastructure to accommodate the needs of \\nolder persons, commensurate to the stage of economic development and societal norms, structures, \\netc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Plan to ensure that the growing number of urban residents, including the poor, have secured access \\nto primary health care services including water, sanitation, etc. by addressing the safety concerns \\nof women, girls, children and older persons, and by ensuring m ore coherent and coordinated service \\ndelivery at the national level.  \\n\\uf0b7 Respond orderly to the conventional as well as new health challenges given the expected mismatch \\nbetween demand for and the supply of resources.    \\n \\n586 \\n 10.4.1  Health Program in the 8FYP  \\nMoHFW h as been pursuing focused improvements in increasing access to quality health services and \\nimproving equity along  with financial protection in order to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by \\n2030. Notable futur e activities are highlighted below:  \\n\\uf0b7 Expansi on and consolidation of community based primary health care services.  \\n\\uf0b7 The UHFWCs will be upgraded with increased human resources for provision of 24/7 services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Quality of medical education & training and HPN services will be ensured through upgradation o f \\nthe educational facilities/institutes and service facilities, modernization of examination process, \\ninclusion of new subjects in curricula, provision of specialty and sub -specialty positions etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reviewing and restructuring of urban primary health care s ervices for catering to the needs of \\nrapidly expanding urban population.  \\n\\uf0b7 Up-gradation of existing and creation of new facilities for service expansion with a view to \\nbringing in more people under universal coverage and reducing individual out -of-pocket \\nexpenditure.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expansion of health protection schemes (e.g., SSK, MHVS) for wider coverage of the poor.  \\n\\uf0b7 Extensive digitalization at all levels of MOHFW and  development of digital data management, \\nincremental use of IT in health, population and nutrition service s.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of laws, rules and formulation of new policies, updating existing policies, etc. for \\nimproved governance, equity and inclusiveness.  \\n \\nThe 8FYP will need to lay emphasis on the continuation of efforts to strengthen core systems to support \\noverall improvement in service efficiency, e.g., the reorganization of the financial management, \\nrestructuring of CMSD as the major procurement unit and other agencies/institutes. It will continue to \\nemphasize on PHC, EPI, MNCH, NCD, nutrition etc. on consi deration of achieving the equity goal and to \\nimplement the updated ESP as part of its strategy to achieve the UHC as proposed in SDG (Goal -3). The \\nhealth sector Program under the 8FYP period will therefore need adequate financial and technical support \\nto implement, monitor and manage the multifarious challenges posed by the ambitious health goals within \\nthe dynamic development process of Bangladesh.  \\nWith a view to realizing the cherished goal of SDGs by the MoHFW, future activities/ programmes  \\nincluding exp ansion of the on -going ones need to be developed, which are giving good results. However, \\narea-wise future activities of MoHFW to be pursued during the 8FYP are highlighted below.  \\nPathways to achieving Universal Health Care and reducing Out of Pocket Expe nditure  \\nAccording to WHO recommendations, to achieve Universal Health Care (UHC), countries must advance \\nin at least three dimensions - expand priority services, include more people, and reduce out -of-pocket \\npayments. Expanding coverage for high -priority se rvices to everyone includes eliminating out -of-pocket \\npayments while increasing mandatory, progressive prepayment with pooling of funds. Bangladesh had \\nalways prioritized a focus on making public health services available and accessible to all its citizens  \\nthrough Health for All (HFA), Primary Health Care (PHC), Essential Service Package (ESP), etc. The ESP, \\nbeing implemented from the levels of CCs to district hospitals as priority intervention for providing PHC \\nservices, represents Government’s commitment to ensure the right to health and that the whole population \\nhas access to the most essential health services. The CC based service provision at the doorstep of the   \\n \\n587 \\n people is a step forward towards achieving the UHC. The CCs are also contributing to reducin g the gap \\nbetween rich and poor with respect to health outcomes in rural areas.  The 4th HPNSP has been serving as \\nthe first, and the foundation stone, of three subsequent SWAps and is aligned to the goal of achieving UHC \\nby 2030, which highlights the right  of every citizen to gain access to quality health care (whether these are \\nobtained from the public or private) without incurring economic hardship.  \\nFurthermore, during the 8FYP period, exploration of v arious innovative approaches will be continued for \\nexpanding PHC services along with improving service quality, which would include review of existing \\nfield-based service delivery; diversification of service provision (inclusive of public -private partnership) \\nparticularly for Hard to Reach (HTR) areas; devel opment of functional referral systems involving all levels \\nof facilities; ensuring quality of care, etc. Public hospitals at all levels will be upgraded with additional beds \\nand modern equipment for ensuring access and utilization of quality health service s by the people.  \\nAssistance will be provided in the Hill District Councils (HDCs)  in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)  to \\ndevelop district -specific health service in co -operation with  MoCHTA and with interested DPs. Steps will \\nbe taken for providing improved health services to the geriatric populations, the ethnic minorities and the \\nother categories. Disability issues (autism, mental health, etc.) will also be properly addressed in \\ncollaboration with various actors (public, private, NGOs) through preventive and curative services \\nincluding expansion of services to cater the need of those who are physically or mentally challenged with \\na view to bringing in more people under universal cove rage and reducing individual out -of-pocket \\nexpenditure (OOPE).  \\nThe social health protection scheme in the name of “Shasthyo Shuroksha Karmasuchi (SSK) is providing \\nfree hospital services to the poor and vulnerable people. The Maternal Health Voucher Scheme  (MHVS), \\nin operation in 55 upazilas, is another health protection scheme for ensuring safe delivery of poor pregnant \\nmothers. During the 8FYP period, coverage of the above -mentioned schemes will be expanded further. \\nBesides, new areas of health protection  will be explored including taking up health insurance schemes for \\ndifferent income groups.  \\nUrban Health Service:  \\nBangladesh is going through significant social and demographic changes, including rapid urbanization, \\nexpanding industrialization, rising inco mes and increase in non -communicable diseases, partly due to poor \\nnutrition related to lifestyle changes. Population growth in urban areas is 2.5% whereas the national \\npopulation growth rate is less than 1.4%. The biggest city, Dhaka alone accounts for 40%  urban population. \\nRapid influx of migrants and increased numbers of people living in urban slums in large cities are creating \\ncontinuous pressure on urban health and nutrition care service. The urban areas provide a contrasting picture \\nof availability of different facilities and services for secondary and tertiary level health care, while primary \\nhealth care and nutrition facilities and services for the urban population at large and the urban poor in \\nparticular are inadequate. With the implementation of th ree urban primary health care projects (UPHCPs) \\nsince 1998, services have been delivered by the City Corporations and Municipalities through contracted \\nNGOs under MoLGRD&C in the project’s areas, but without any sustained arrangement for continuation \\nof ur ban primary health care (UPHC) service after project completion. Besides public institutions, private \\nhealth and nutrition care facilities as well as school health clinics play an important role in the provision of   \\n \\n588 \\n health and nutrition services in urban ar eas which requires increased efforts for coordination and quality \\ncontrol through sustained regulatory mechanisms.  \\nThere is need to establish a permanent coordination structure between the two Ministries to take up the \\nmutual mandated responsibility in a s ustained and effective manner. MoHFW will join in tackling this \\nchallenge through a consultative process with MoLGRD&C, city corporations and concerned stakeholders \\nto jointly assess, map, project and plan HPN services in urban areas. The emphasis on coord ination of urban \\nhealth and nutrition will be a new (and very different) element compared to past programmes . It will involve \\nMoHFW working in new ways with its partners, notably MoLGRD&C, NGOs, Private secto r service \\nproviders and others.  \\nMoHFW will seek to extend the coverage of UPHC services through the urban dispensaries under the \\nDGHS, which are in the process of improvement by strengthening referral system in the facilities, so that \\nthe population receives better health and nutrition services. MoHFW w ill also provide UPHC services \\nthrough the outdoors of secondary and tertiary hospitals of urban areas that will continue to be strengthened. \\nMoreover, the UPHC service will be strengthened through introducing evening shifts in terms of coverage, \\nquality a nd equity of service delivery in response to demand. However, some other priority activities will \\ninclude:  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing an urban health and nutrition strategy with time bound action plan in collaboration with \\nMoLGRD&C.  \\n\\uf0b7 Commissioning a study to review and de termine how the urban population can be best served and \\nthe two Ministries can jointly work together to provide quality HPN services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing a permanent institutional arrangement and governance mechanism incorporating \\nrelevant ministries, agencies a nd institutions with responsibility to urban health and nutrition.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding/upgrading urban dispensaries for quality PHC services (including services for \\nreproductive health, nutrition, health education and screening of diabetes and hypertension).  \\n\\uf0b7 Definin g an adequate referral system between the various urban dispensaries and the second and \\nthird level hospitals, and exploring feasibility of introducing General Physician (GP) system.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing and utilizing urban HIS for effective management of urban heal th care.  \\n\\uf0b7 Building capacity of the various service providers under MoHFW and MoLGRD&C.  \\n\\uf0b7 Determining the role and accountability of different NGOs and the private sector in the delivery of \\nurban health.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding health service delivery through PPPs and thro ugh diversification of strategies.  \\nMaternal, Neonatal, Child and Reproductive & Adolescent Health   \\nMaternal and newborn health (MNH) services are inter -related and need to be delivered simultaneously \\ncovering preconception, pregnancy, childbirth and the i mmediate postpartum periods. The services need to \\nbe delivered by skilled providers along with prompt and appropriate management of complications in \\nadequately staffed and equipped EmOC facilities, functioning at 24/7 levels gradually. As such a two -\\npronge d strategy will be followed: (i) promotion of institutional services in all districts and upazilas and (ii) \\nsustaining and expanding home -based services, in varying degrees based on local needs, particularly in \\nplaces with geographic or social restrictions  on seeking care from facilities.    \\n \\n589 \\n Institutional births will be promoted actively through BCC at personal, group and national levels through \\ninnovative strategies incorporating the mass and electronic media. Preconception and pregnancy related \\nservices wil l be provided by trained providers at the CC level and by NGOs where found feasible and \\nappropriate. Priority will be given to areas with high rates of MMR and to the economically, geographically \\nand socially disadvantaged. Strategies to improve effectiven ess of referrals will be developed and \\nimplemented. There is great need to strengthen regulation of the private sector, given the high levels of \\ncesarean sections in these facilities.    \\nSpecific attention will be given to promote essential newborn care se rvices with emphasis on prevention \\nand management of asphyxia and neonatal infections, and care for the Low Birth Weight and pre -term \\nbabies. This will require extensive training of the existing community -based workers and the new \\ncommunity health care pro viders (CHCP) and supporting them through operational guidelines. Sick \\nnewborn services will be strengthened at the UHCs and district hospitals with rapid referral systems of sick \\nnewborns to these facilities. However, some other priority activities will i nclude:  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting MNH services nationwide including the urban slums, in collaboration with other health \\ncare providers including NGOs and using mass media.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving quality of maternal and neonatal health services from preconception to the postnatal \\nperiod in facilities from the medical colleges to CCs and including evidence -based interventions, \\nnotably to address hemorrhage and eclampsia.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening 24/7 EmOC services gradually through improving HR development, placement and \\nretention with skill mix a t various tiers of service delivery and in identified facilities through a \\ndetailed mapping exercise considering emergency referrals, communication and transportation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving strategies to expand skilled birth attendance at institutional level and at ho me through \\ncontinued CSBA training program.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding the maternal voucher scheme and other health protection schemes.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening the maternal morbidity (Obstetric Fistula, Cervical Cancer, Breast Cancer, Uterine \\nProlapsed) related treatment, prevention  and rehabilitation services with referral mechanism.  \\nBuilding on the current success, efforts will be strengthened to maintain and increase coverage of the \\nimmunization program, incorporating vaccines for greater number of diseases with especial focus on low \\nperforming areas. The next sector program (during 8FYP ) will sustain and expand all the on -going child \\nhealth and nutrition initiatives with special emphasis on reaching the poorer and disadvantaged children \\nmore effectively and through partnering with  NGOs following a mapping exercise, where appropriate.  Key \\nactivities to improve Child Health will include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding IMCI particularly community based IMCI including child nutrition services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Tackling ARI and diarrhea through expansion of IMCI particula rly at the community level to cover \\nthe whole country with special emphasis on hard to reach areas.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring growth promotion with counseling on exclusive breast feeding.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening and sustaining of routine immunization and disease surveillance along with \\nSupplementary Immunization Activities, NID, Measles/ MNT Campaigns etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing and implementing strategies to prevent childhood injuries including drowning, \\naccidental poisoning and other injuries.    \\n \\n590 \\n \\uf0b7 Sustaining and expanding the ongoing School Healt h Teachers’ Training activities including \\npromotion of healthy school environment and practices, nutrition education etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Carrying out appropriate training of the doctors, nurses, paramedics and field and community \\nworkers as per need.  \\nThe National Repro ductive Health Strategy and the Adolescent Health Strategy including national \\nstandards guide the services to be provided.  Based on these strategies, the reproductive and adolescent \\nhealth improvement related activities will include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving knowledge of women, men and particularly the adolescents, on reproductive health \\n(RTI/ STI, abortion, infertility, etc.) including HIV/AIDS, relevant legal and gender equity issues \\nthrough the activities of DGHS, DGFP, MoWCA, MoY&S, MoE and NGOs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing access t o reproductive and adolescent friendly health services through the frontline \\nhealth personnel and appropriate NGO workers at individual level, school -based programmes , CCs, \\nstrong social/community mobilization and opening up adolescent corners.   \\n\\uf0b7 Creating positive change in the behavior and attitude of the protectors of adolescents (parents, \\nguardians, teachers, religious leaders, Peers, etc.) towards adolescent RH issues.  \\n\\uf0b7 Carrying out appropriate training of service providers of health and community health  workers.  \\nDiseases Control Program  \\n(a) Communicable Disease Control (CDC)  \\nPriority Communicable diseases are poverty -related diseases and improvements in overall living conditions \\nand nutrition status, increase in household income, etc. impact on reducing  the burden of communicable \\ndiseases, including the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).  \\nTB control is an active public health program which will be maintained to reduce all forms of TB prevalence \\nand incidence rates by emphasizing DOTS implementation with  effective referral. About 12 million people \\nin 13 districts of the north -eastern border belt and Chittagong Hill Tracts, live in malaria high -risk areas \\nand account for about 98% of malaria cases. For this, further strengthening of diagnostic procedures, RDT \\nand emphasized training of staff will be made during the 8FYP . Bangladesh has low prevalence of HIV, \\nbut an increasingly large number of laborers live abroad and therefore risk of spread of HIV is significantly \\nhigh and requires constant vigilance. For  this, the national AIDS/STD program (NASP) will be rolled over \\nto the 8FYP as well with the objective to minimize the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Leprosy  was \\npractically eliminated (prevalence of less than 1 per 10,000 people) nationally in 1998 exce pt in 5 districts. \\nLeprosy elimination target is to be achieved for every district during the 8FYP  through training of health \\ncare staff, raising awareness among the population, active detection and patient management in pockets of \\nhigh leprosy prevalence.   \\nBangladesh is among the first four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand) in the South -East \\nAsia region to achieve Hepatitis B control, with the disease dropping to less than 1% among under five -\\nyear-old children. However, control of Hepatiti s B & C remains a critical public health concern. \\nGovernment interventions including establishment of a multi -sectoral approach for activities related to \\nprevention and control; introduction of vaccine to high risk group and establishment of surveillance s ystem \\nfor Hepatitis virus infected cases are continuing. During the 8FYP  period, prevention and control of   \\n \\n591 \\n Hepatitis B & C related activities will be strengthened and intensified. Control of  NTDs  such as filariasis, \\nkala-azar, soil transmitted helminths ar e some of the priority communicable diseases requiring further \\nattention during the 8FYP . Strategies for controlling and eliminating the NTDs will be revisited and updated \\nin collaboration with relevant private sector and NGO actors. Other communicable dis eases, like dengue, \\nchikungunya, avian flu, swine flu, Nipah virus, anthrax, mass psychogenic illness and Hepatitis etc. as \\nemerging and re -emerging diseases will also be addressed. For this, as per the global standard Infection, \\nPrevention and Control Uni t (IPCU) is needed to be established.  \\n(b) Non -Communicable Disease Control (NCDC)  \\nReduction of morbidity and premature mortality due to the ‘conventional’ NCDs require appropriate actions \\nat all levels and in an integrated manner from primary prevention t o treatment and rehabilitation. The \\ngovernment, in partnership with local government bodies and the private sector, will create greater \\nawareness with the assistance of Bureau of Health Education and provide services for the control of \\nunhealthy diet and l ifestyle related major NCDs such as cardio -vascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. \\nExisting preventive and curative measures for the NCDs will be further strengthened and expanded to \\nincrease access through providing effective number of personnel, training , logistics and funding. Moreover, \\nNCD corners will be established in each UHFWC in phases during the 8FYP  period.  \\nEye Care: Studies have shown that 4 to 11% of the Bangladeshis suffer from permanent disability due to \\nblindness. To facilitate prevention, c ase identification, referral, management, treatment and rehabilitation, \\nthe relevant activities need to be integrated with primary health care (PHC) especially through the services \\nof the community clinics. School Sight testing will be included in primary schools and the past emphasis \\non successful vitamin A administration will be continued. More attention will be given to postnatal vitamin \\nA administration through CC staff, in collaboration with school teachers and senior students as relevant. \\nThe National  Eye Care Plan will be upgraded and implemented in the 8FYP . \\nMental and Autism Health Care: Mental health problems are increasing amid changing life styles. \\nCOVID -19 has aggravated the situation. In pursuance of the government\\'s strong commitment for \\nadequ ately addressing the counseling and treatment of mental health, partnerships with the media and \\nNGOs will be developed to raise public awareness about appropriate attitude and behavior towards mental \\npatients. Public sector, NGO/ CBO workers and school and  religious teachers, will be trained to identify \\nand counsel substance abuse and mental and emotional cases, provide and follow up simple treatment as \\nfeasible, life skill training and refer serious cases to public facility, where treatment facilities will  also be \\nexpanded. For autism health care development, autism corners and child development centers will be \\nestablished in medical colleges and upazila and district level hospitals. Genetic testing facilities for autism \\n(in genetic origin) will be develope d in every medical college hospital.   \\nElderly and Palliative Care:  Life expectancy is gradually increasing and is now 72.6 years and as a \\nresult the proportion of elderly people has also been increased. There is a need for reorienting the \\nexisting institut ional arrangements for health service delivery and to increase investment – both \\nfinancial and human resources – in developing an appropriate Elderly and Palliative Health Care \\n(EPHC) service system. MoHFW will promote multi -sector collaboration with other  ministries (e.g., \\nMinistry of Social Welfare), private sector, NGOs, CSOs, etc. for providing EPHC - friendly health care \\nin the country. During the 8FYP period, awareness building, establishing palliative care units in all \\nmedical college hospitals, intro ducing modern medicines and advance equipment to all medical college   \\n \\n592 \\n hospitals, capacity development of health personnel, etc. steps will be taken up regarding palliative care. \\nSpecial card for the elderly people to reduce health expenditure in hospitals w ill be introduced. Capacity \\nof the health workforce regarding handling the geriatric patient will be enhanced.  \\nHearing Disability  (Deafness): About 13 million people are suffering from variable degree of hearing loss \\n(HL) in Bangladesh of which 3 million h ave severe to profound HL and are major but neglected causes of \\ndisability. Early detection of impaired hearing and proper management could prevent permanent hearing \\ndisability. Early detection at the primary level and management of these cases at the seco ndary and tertiary \\nlevel will be initiated for control of hearing disability (Deafness) during the 8FYP .  \\nOral Health:  Lack of knowledge and awareness regarding oral hygiene are the main issues which cause \\noral diseases to be a public health problem. Preve ntive approach through mass education and raising \\nawareness will be prioritized. Adoption of proper cleaning procedure of the oral cavity and bringing strict \\nrestrictions in bad habits (such as smoking, chewing paan, eating excessive sugary food) can reduc e most \\nof the common and complicated oral diseases. Oral health awareness should start early in life and this best \\ndone both through parent counselling and care and through integration in the school curriculum. Mass \\nmedia public campaigns are also useful t ool for improving public knowledge and awareness.  \\nNon-conventional Non -Communicable Diseases  \\nRoad Safety and Injury Prevention: Approximately 70,000 deaths occur each year due to injury (burning, \\ndrowning, acid and accidents at work). Some 40 to 45% of inj uries are due to road traffic accidents in urban \\nareas and 54% of them involve pedestrians. Dialogue with the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridgesfor \\nsafety policies and regulation, enhance skills of DGHS service providers to handle injury patients, buil d up \\nawareness of the people on pedestrian safety measures will be emphasized by HSD during 8FYP . \\nCommunity mobilization will be done in collaboration with urban NGOs and city corporation authorities \\nto keep walkway free of any hindrance which discourage p eople from using walkways.  \\nViolence against Women: Violence against women and girls devastates lives, fractures communities, and \\nstalls development. In collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) and \\nMinistry of Social Welfare (Mo SW), HSD will carry out expansion and strengthening of the one stop crisis \\ncenters to serve the affected women. Besides, all health care providers will be sensitized through relevant \\nprogrammes  to pay special attention and prioritize women violence survivo rs in all public health facilities.  \\nEmergency Preparedness and Response: Based on past experience, during 8FYP  the main strategi c aims \\nare to increase the level of readiness at all tiers of the health system and improve the capacity of the sector \\nfor coord inated post -disaster management. Standard national guidelines for mass casualty management as \\nwell as manual for local level health response will be issued and necessary training will be conducted.  \\nOccupational Health and Safety: The occupational health a nd safety services in Bangladesh are \\ninadequate, both in terms of quality and quantity. A major portion of workers in the informal sectors are at \\nrisk of developing acute and chronic toxicity due to exposure to toxic pesticides, chemicals and fertilizers, \\noccurrence of occupational diseases and injuries. During 8FYP , HSD will continue its preventive and \\ncontrol measures in collaboration with other relevant ministries (e.g., Ministry of Industries, Ministry of \\nLabor and Employment) to address occupational he alth hazards, diseases and risks in a cost -effective \\nmanner.    \\n \\n593 \\n Tobacco Control and Substance Abuse including Narcotic Drug: Tobacco causes huge deaths and a \\nmassive financial loss in Bangladesh every year.10 The recent Covid -19 pandemic has demonstrated how \\ntobacco users are highly vulnerable to such outbreaks.11Bangladesh has ratified WHO Framework \\nConvention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and a National Tobacco Control Cell (NTCC) has been formed \\nby the MoHFW to streamline tobacco control activities. During 8FYP , the NTCC will be strengthened by \\nbuilding capacity, advocacy and awareness campaigns. Innovative community -based management \\nprogrammes , training material development, support for research on substance abuse etc. will be promoted \\nby the Bureau of Health Ed ucation for mounting anti -tobacco and anti -substance use messages.  \\nAbuse of narcotic drugs and substance abuse is an emerging social problem particularly among the \\nyouths. During the 8FYP period, MoHFW will continue public awareness building activities ag ainst \\nillicit use of drugs including \\'Yaba\\', \\'Phensedyl, and ‘Heroine\\' abuse. Health education programme \\nagainst addictive substance abuse will be introduced in educational institutes. Capacity for diagnosis, \\ntreatment and rehabilitation of substance abuse  will be increased. Necessary steps will be taken to \\nestablish required specialized rehabilitation centers for the drug addicted patients during the 8FYP.  \\n \\nMedical Waste Management:  \\n \\nMedical waste management has recently emerged as an issue of major concer n that needs to be addressed. \\nCurrent practices for management of medical waste from public hospitals are inadequate to keep the public \\nfacilities hazardous free. An appropriate, safe, and cost -effective strategy will need to be developed with \\ntreatment, r ecycling, transport, and disposal  options for p roper waste management and ensuring health and \\nenvironmental safety.  \\n \\nEnvironmental Health and Climate Change  \\nNatural disasters and climate change are increasingly impacting upon health and wellbeing. Respira tory \\ndiseases, heat strokes, cardio -vascular illness and exposure to vector -borne diseases like malaria, dengue, \\nrisk of water -borne diseases such as cholera are on the rise while reduced food availability is leading to \\nincreased malnutrition. Creating a w ell-coordinated approach for protecting health from climate change and \\npost disaster health hazards still remains a challenge for the government. To build capacity and strengthen \\nhealth systems to combat the health impact of climate change, the Climate Cha nge and Health Promotion \\nUnit (CCHPU) has been formed to strengthen necessary activities.  \\nDuring 8FYP, the level of readiness at all tiers of the health system will be strengthened for emergency \\nresponse; capacity of the sector will be increased for coord inated post -disaster management and protecting \\npeople’s health from climate change. Standard national guidelines for mass casualty management as well \\n                                                     \\n10  Tobacco -attributable diseases caused nearly 126,000 deaths in 2018  and tobacco -induced diseases cost the economy BDT 305.6 billion (USD \\n3.6 billion)  in Bangladesh , which is equivalent to 1.4% of the national output (GDP) in 2017 -18.

Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would \\ngreatly increase risk of serious illness. Available at:  https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/covid -19-and-ncds \\n   \\n \\n594 \\n as manual for local level health response will be issued, necessary training will be conducted and emergen cy \\nhealth supplies and their stockpiling will be standardized. Partnership will be forged with disaster \\nmanagement agencies, groups and individuals for improving emergency preparedness, prevention and \\nmitigation. The existing health research agenda will in clude the adverse effect of climate change on health, \\nand field surveys and studies will be conducted to identify effects of climate change on health.  \\nDisease Surveillance  \\n \\nA functional disease surveillance system is necessary for planning, resource mobil ization and allocation, \\nprediction and early detection of epidemics, pandemic alert and response, monitoring and evaluation. \\nDuring 8FYP , IEDCR will be strengthened to turn it into an apex institute for epidemiological surveillance \\nin the country for carry ing out epidemiological surveillance of communicable and non -communicable \\ndiseases with laboratory support.  The goal of integrated disease surveillance is to ensure that each person \\nhas the capacity to define, detect and respond to comm unicable public heal th threats. To this end, an \\nintegrated disease surveillance programme will be developed during the 8FYP period to provide timely, \\ncomplete, regular and high -quality information; early detect and predict epidemics (early warning systems); \\nassess interventio ns during epidemics; and monitor intervention programmes efficiently.  A Central \\nSurveillance Unit will be established for strengthening/maintaining decentralized laboratory -based IT and \\nresponding to outbreaks in early rising phase through trained Rapid Re sponse Team (RRTs). A country -\\nbased referral laboratory network will be established by utilizing the existing functional labs in the \\nidentified medical colleges and other major centers in the country and linking them with adjoining districts \\nand upazillas for providing diagnostic services for epidemic prone diseases during outbreaks.  DGHS will \\ncoordinate all activities currently carried out by relevant institutes/ agencies to establish an effective NCD \\nsurveillance system. Capacity of all hospitals will be strengthened to assist in disease surveillance and \\ndiagnosis. Teachers of primary schools, NGO workers and community volunteers will be trained to identify \\nthe clinical features of the most common endemic diseases. Partnering with private health care provi ders \\nfor better surveillance, reporting, referral and case management will be established. Mapping of all major \\ndiseases, on the basis of their incidence and prevalence, will be constructed for each district and upazila.  \\n \\nAlternative Medical Care (AMC)  \\nUnani, Ayuverdic & Homeopathic medical services have been extended to outdoor departments of district \\nhospitals and herbal centers at the upazila health complexes. AMC is weakened by the lack of standards of \\nthe system, poor job opportunity, research, public ation, information and awareness about AMC. During \\n8FYP , required strengthening of the research, monitoring, production and publication, workshop and \\ntraining will be made. Existing two AMC colleges and hospitals including outdoor services will also be \\nstrengthened.  \\nBehaviour Change Communication (BCC)  \\nBCC activities of the Bureau of Health Education (BHE) are intended to bring about behavioral changes \\namong the people towards safe motherhood, breast feeding, climate change, emerging and re -emerging \\ndisease s, food safety, vaccination, vitamin A administration, neonatal care, violence against women, \\nnutrition etc. through special emphasis on interpersonal communication, electronic and print media. \\nComprehensive BCC programmes  will be developed in building com munity knowledge and skills to \\npromote use of MNCH services and to enhance basic health education in schools/madrassas for children   \\n \\n595 \\n and youth.  Promoting health and nutrition services through electronic and print media and motivational \\nprogrammes  in the fo rm of feature films, posters, local dramas, etc. will continue to be the materials of \\nBCC activities.  \\nStrengthening Health Systems:  \\nHuman Resources for Health: In addition to address the  issue of HR shortage in the health sector, \\nMoHFW will focus on improv ing quality of public and private pre -service health workforce education \\nsystem; capacity development to ensure better management at all levels of service delivery; \\noperationalization of the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) for evidence -based deci sion; and \\nstrengthening quality assurance of medical education at both private and public sector institutions through \\nlicensing and accreditation. During the 8FYP  period, all vacant positions of MoHFW will be gradually \\nfilled up. The organograms of all hea lth and family planning agencies along with their facilities will be \\nreviewed and updated for provision of quality HPN services.  \\nGovernance and Stewardship: There is widespread public perception about the quality of health services \\nprovided either by the public or the private/ non -state actors, as being low. Weak governance in the public \\nsector has contributed to unavailability of designated health personnel, reported pilferage of drugs and other \\nessential supplies, alleged mistreatment and negligence, una uthorized and illegal payments in health \\nfacilities while internal monitoring and oversight mechanisms remain weak.  The poor and the vulnerable \\nmembers of the society bear the brunt of the weak governance both in terms of cost and deficient service \\ndelive ry.  \\nDuring 4th HPNSP period, governance and stewardship has been made a component to prioritize its \\nimportance and continuous efforts are being made in improving the system. The stewardship role and \\ncapacity of the MoHFW will further be strengthened throu gh improved monitoring of quality of care and \\nsafety of patients in both public and private sectors. DGHS will develop a periodic inspection system of \\nfacilities and services, with necessary support, on a regular basis at all levels and act upon the findin gs to \\nimprove client satisfaction.  \\nLegal and Regulatory Framework: The main regulatory functions under the HSD are: i) accreditation of \\nhospitals, private health services, diagnostic centers and training institutions (including medical colleges); \\nii) lice nsing and control of pharmaceuticals and of some cadres of health workers; and iii) overall setting \\nof standards, including for alternative medical care and medical waste management. In the 8FYP , HSD will \\ncontinue to update the mandates, structures and bui ld capacity of the various national regulatory bodies to \\nincrease their effectiveness and functionality and review structure and capacity of the HSD Directorates to \\nstrengthen supervision and enhance institutional management. HSD also intends to partner wi th NGOs and \\nprivate sector for strengthening existing regulatory mechanisms and creating new ones.  \\nSupply of Essential Drugs and Rational use  \\nEssential Drugs Company Limited (EDCL), a company owned by the Government produces all essential \\ndrugs for consum ption at the public facilities (CCs, UHCs, DHs, MCHs). It has production factories in \\nDhaka and Bogura. In addition, EDCL also has one latex plant at Khulna for producing condoms. EDCL \\nhas also undertaken a programme for establishing one world class modern  pharmaceutical industry at \\nGopalganj, which in addition to essential medicines will also produce birth control pills, injectables, iron \\ntablets and IV fluids.    \\n \\n596 \\n A growing concern in disease control is the irrational use of medicines. Irrational use of antib iotics, which \\nresults in increasing trends of MDR -TB, and few other communicable diseases in the country. Limited \\nawareness of the patients regarding proper dosage, reliance over the counter availability of prescription \\ndrugs and import of illegal drugs of  doubtful quality are the principal challenges to ensure rational use of \\ndrugs in our country. During the 8FYP  period, national clinical guidelines as well as antibiotic use \\nguidelines will be prepared and made available to the health care professionals. M ass awareness will be \\ncreated about rational use of drugs and the adverse effect of irrational use of antibiotics.  \\nGender, Equity and Voice  \\nThe Government of Bangladesh has made it a priority to eliminate discrimination against women and girls \\nand promot e gender equity. The MoHFW will uphold the same during the 8FYP  period as well. The existing \\nGender Equity Strategy of HSD are being implemented to overcome barriers of various gender related \\nissues including human resource management at facility level, ho using, promotion for women workforce, \\netc. The 8FYP  will adopt specific measures and adjustments in approaches and services to ensure that the \\nneeds of the various regions and groups are identified, analyzed and appropriate measures taken through \\ndecentral izing authority and allocating special funds. Voice and accountability mechanisms will be \\nmainstreamed into the governance and stewardship functions of the overall health program. A local level \\naccountability mechanism will be developed in participation wi th the community people and local NGOs \\nto improve utilization of health services by the local communities and the disadvantaged groups.  \\nHealth Card and Digitalization  \\nTo meet the challenges of 21st century and commencement of 4IR, Government has been prep aring to \\nintroduce Health Card for its citizen. This card will be electronically readable and Electronic Medical \\nReports of citizens will be linked to the card and stored in Central Online Data Base. There is strong \\ncommitment from the Government to capita lization of 4IR, and to act on that health care system needs to \\nbe fully digitalized and optimized through automation as much as possible. This will reduce cost of service \\ndelivery and improve the quality of service as well as act as real time disease & re source surveillance. This \\nwill enable better planning, resource allocation and logistics & inventory management. During the 8FYP \\nperiod, Health Card with linked EMR database will be established along with scaling up of electronic \\ntracking system of the cit izen’s health. Integration of Health information and eHealth Platforms amongst \\ndifferent agencies and stakeholders will be made including optimization and automation of Health Care \\nsystem through digitalization.  \\nNon-Governmental Organizations and Public Pr ivate Partnership  \\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)  are a significant and growing means of health service delivery \\nin both rural and urban Bangladesh. There are some well -established and institutionally strong NGOs as (i) \\nhealth care providers, (ii) i nnovators in diversifying modalities of service delivery, (iii) training formal and \\ninformal health providers, (iv) research and development and (v) catalyst/facilitator for demand creation \\nand linking community with health facilities. Building and strengt hening linkages with the NGOs will be \\nan approach to complement government efforts in increasing access of the poor, the disadvantaged and the \\nhard-to-reach populations to HPN services.    \\n \\n597 \\n Public Private Partnership (PPP) is also being practiced in the healt h sector by the government as an \\napproach for enhancing effective health service delivery. PPPs can help address innovations in service \\ndesign and management expertise, empowerment of the service recipients, protection of environment, social \\njustice and ri ght based service provision. The PPP in service delivery and in the areas of medical and allied \\neducation will be further expanded and strengthened during the 8FYP  with effective regulatory \\nmechanisms.  \\nIn-service Training  \\nDGHS, DGFP, DGME and DGNM will co ntinue to provide pre -service  and in -service training in various \\nfields of health and nutrition services to develop skills based on a good diagnostic of the skills mix and the \\nskills gap and generate information through research/ studies for having quality  human resources in HPN \\nservices. For this, during the 8FYP  period, MoHFW through  the agencies under it will continue to perform \\nwith the preparation of training curriculum, modules, etc.; organizing orientation and other in -services \\ntraining courses for the newly recruited medical officers, doctors, health technicians, other health \\nprofessionals and workers, etc.; conducting training of the trainers on competency based training, updating \\nof curriculum and printing; developing new ideas/thoughts for traini ng and exchanging information/data \\non required technology; and conducting disease/area specific surveys, research and studies on facilities, \\nhealth service, etc. Similar in -service training activities will also be performed by other institutes (e.g., \\nBIHM)  of M oHFW for skill development.  \\nMulti -sector Approach  \\nDuring the 8FYP, efforts will be made to further improve upon existing platforms of coordination between \\nMoHFW and relevant stakeholders including the private sector and explore feasible new modes for \\nmaximization of available resources to ensure equity. Key areas of such coordination and collaboration \\nwould include - urban health (M oLGRDC) and ethnic minority health (MoCHTA) for resource sharing, \\nprogram planning, implementation and review; parallel pr ojects (both GoB and DP) to avoid duplication \\nand develop complementarities; NGO/private sector for management/operation of non -functional facilities \\nand/or providing services in hard -to-reach areas or for exploring feasibility of new services/technology; \\ncommunity, public representatives and local government’s  involvement in augmenting resources, \\nmanagement and oversight of service facilities in their locality; etc. The 8FYP will also put increased focus \\non establishing stronger coordination and collabora tion among multiple sectors affecting health outcomes \\n(e.g. malnutrition, NCDs); addressing issues like PHC coverage in urban areas; and promoting healthy \\nlifestyles and environment through comprehensive social behaviour change communication (SBCC) in \\ncollaboration with all relevant Government agencies, private sector participants, DPs and other \\nstakeholders.  \\nMechanisms for Improving Implementation Capacity  \\nWith a view to realizing the objectives of the 8FYP and improving capacity to implement programmes  \\n/activities, continuous and further actions will need to be undertaken on the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 In-service training in various fields of service delivery of the officers and technical support staff at \\nall levels including those of managers/administrative personnel need to be continued.    \\n \\n598 \\n \\uf0b7 Operationalize harmonization of services  of the service providers (DGHS, DGFP, DGNM) towards \\na more effective and efficient service delivery.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance capacity for evidence -, need - and result -based budgeting and planning through \\ndevelopment of a five -year training plan for skill development training of the key workforce.  \\n\\uf0b7 Review of the existing strengths and weaknesses of the Agencies for strengthening health systems \\nand improvement  of service quality.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce and rationalize projects outside the SWAp Program and establish risk pooling and \\npurchasing mechanism towards UHC.  \\n\\uf0b7 Update and implement the Health Workforce Strategy (HWS) and a 5 -yearly rolling plan to guide \\nproduction (number with skill -mix) of doctors and nurses.  \\n\\uf0b7 Synchronize c onstruction facilities with equipment and human resources. Also strengthen \\nincreased use of health facilities along with their professional management.  \\n\\uf0b7 Health personnel specially physicians who working in the field level should be given more \\nemphasis for i n service local and foreign training to keep them in locality  \\n\\uf0b7 Facilities and opportunities need to be created for the health personnel to keep them working in \\nupazila level  \\n\\uf0b7 Demand based higher studies should be made available for health personnel specially  physicians  \\n\\uf0b7 Rationalize procurement management.  \\nInstitutional Mechanism for Monitoring  \\nMoHFW through the two divisions viz., HSD and MEFWD has been monitoring progress of regular \\nprogrammes  and other project activities in line with government’s existing mo nitoring systems. These are \\nMonthly ADP Review; IMED’s Quarterly Review, Annual Program Review (APR), Mid -term Review \\n(MTR), etc. mechanisms. Besides, there are committees to review OP/Project Implementation, inter -\\nministerial committees for reviewing mult i-sector issues like nutrition, urban health, food safety, etc. \\nmechanisms are also regularly followed. In addition, as the HPN sector program is also financed by a large \\nnumber of DPs, well -tested platforms of monitoring consisting of GOB and DP represent ations, such as \\nLocal Consultative Group on Health, and various Task Groups and the Steering Committees will be \\ncontinued with focus on improving results from specific HPN services and their supporting health systems.  \\nBesides, a number of activities to su pport capacity building, streamlining, and scaling up of M&E systems \\nare being implemented during the 7FYP period through the financing from 4th HPNSP. These activities are \\nlinked to the achievement of results as defined by the Results Framework (RFW) and a set of OP level \\nindicators to monitor implementation progress. The OPs are currently formally reviewed to assess \\nimplementation progress and a six -monthly/annually report is produced regularly. Given the renewed focus \\non tracking progress under the curre nt global (e.g. SDG) as well as national (e.g. 7FYP) and ministerial \\n(e.g. disbursement linked indicators) commitments, de velopment of six -monthly program implementation \\nreport (SmPR), annual program implementation report (APIR) internally and annual progr am review (APR) \\nby independent review team (IRT) to monitor progress of OP implementation and sector performance; \\ntracking of DLI progress through DLI Monitoring Committee, etc. institutional mechanisms along with \\ncapacity building of relevant staff will c ontinue to be pursued during the 8FYP  period as well.    \\n \\n599 \\n 10.4.2  Medical Education Program in the 8FYP  \\nThe Medical Education Program under a new Division of MoHFW with new focus started its operation \\nduring mid -way of the implementation of 7FYP. But with a vi ew to realize the cherished goal of SDGs, \\nfuture activities/ programmes  including expansion of the on -going ones will need to be developed with due \\nemphasis on producing quality human resources for health. The main activities for the 8FYP include:  \\nMedical a nd Nursing Education:  \\n\\uf0b7 Bringing in all post -graduate degrees of medical education under one platform and coordinate the \\nactivities for quality education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of medical accreditation council.  \\n\\uf0b7 Modernization of examination process and inclusion of n ew/specialized subjects in the \\nmedical/dental/nursing/paramedical education curricula in accordance with international \\nstandards. Expansion of super -specialty medical education will be promoted.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of nursing/paramedical education board.  \\n\\uf0b7 Continu ous training of teachers for improvement of quality medical education as well as health \\nservices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance research activity of teachers in medical education and health related issues.  \\n\\uf0b7 Implementation of Government’s commitment for establishing medical unive rsity at every \\nDivision for promoting post -graduate medical education and medical college at each district of the \\ncountry.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of digital data management, incremental use of IT in medical institutions and making \\nquality medical and nursing educatio n service easily available to all concerned.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening medical and nursing education research activities for improving quality in teaching \\nand services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of laws, rules, procedures, and formulation of new policies, updating existing \\npolici es, etc. for promoting quality medical, nursing and paramedical education and services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of new physical facilities & upgradation of existing ones and repair and maintenance \\nof the facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure the standard of medical and nursing educati on in private sector.  \\n\\uf0b7 Encourage specialization of basic subject in medical science.  \\nNursing & Midwifery Services:  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing the number of nurses and midwives through creating additional seats in nursing \\ninstitutions and continue to provide skill developme nt training to them.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen technology -based education and training programmes  for quality improvement and \\neffective monitoring.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve and control the standard of nursing education through the Accreditation Guidelines.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen and expand online nursing services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of nursing and midwifery work plan for realizing the SDGs and preparation of training \\nplan for on the job training.  \\n\\uf0b7 Produce specialized nurses as demanded by the specialized hospitals.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of a Nursing Teachers’ Tra ining College for producing quality nurses.    \\n \\n600 \\n National Institute for Population Research and Training (NIPORT)  \\nNIPORT will have to continue to provide in -service training to develop skills and generate information \\nthrough research/ studies with a view to hav e quality human resources for nutrition service provision and \\npromotion in HPN services. For this, NIPORT will continue to perform with the following:  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparation of training curriculum, modules, etc. and organize orientation courses for the newly \\nrecruit ed medical officers, senior staff nurses, FWAs, FWVs, other health and FP professionals \\nand workers including nutrition workers, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Conduct training of the trainers on competency -based training, updating of curriculum and printing.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop new ideas/thou ghts for training and exchange information/data on required technology  \\n\\uf0b7 Conduct operations research and collaborative research for improvement of HPN services and \\nimprove research capacity building.  \\n\\uf0b7 Conduct surveys on facilities, demography & health, etc.,  research and studies and disseminate the \\nfindings.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construct new multipurpose (Office/Academic/Hostel) building for NIPORT Head Office and \\nrenovate existing facilities with modern equipment.  \\nFacilities Development  \\nThe Health Engineering Department (HED) i s responsible for physical facilities development of MoHFW. \\nFacilities will be developed during the 8FYP  period to cater to the needs of making public HPN services \\naccessible to the entire population. These include up -gradation, new establishment, rebuildi ng & repair, \\nrenovation of existing ones of UHFWCs, repair, renovation & remodeling of RDs/Union Sub -centres, \\nestablishment of MCWCs, up -gradation & new construction of FWVTIs, IHT, MATS, Nursing Colleges, \\nrepair and remodeling of Nursing Institutes, const ruction of boundary walls of different facilities, etc. Besides, \\nHR, equipment, machineries and other logistics will also be required to make the facilities fully ready for \\nservice delivery.  \\nThe work volume and speed of HED has to be matched with the incre asing demand of creating facilities \\nfor medical education and FP services. This necessitates the need for strengthening HED with additional \\nskilled manpower, logistics, training facilities, etc. Therefore, HED needs to be reorganized during the 8FYP .  \\n10.5 NUTR ITION PROGRAM IN 8FYP  \\nIn Bangladesh both chronic and acute malnutrition levels are higher than the WHO’s thresholds for public \\nhealth emergencies, although there has been considerable progress in decreasing malnutrition, in particular \\nundernutrition and mi cro nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, over nutrition due to life -style changes and intake \\nof junk food is an emerging problem in urban areas as well, increasing the burden of NCDs such as obesity, \\ndiabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The key strategies and  actions to be pursued during the 8FYP are \\ncontinuation of nutrition service through regular government channels, micro -nutrient supplementation, \\ntreatment of severe acute malnutrition, strengthening BCC to promote good nutritional practices, \\ncoordination of nutrition activities across different sectors and mainstreaming gender into nutrition \\nprogramming and promoting equity. Simultaneously, availability of adequate skilled human resources and \\nnutrition logistics and commodities through improved supply chai n management will be prioritized and ensured.     \\n \\n601 \\n Strategy for Nutrition  \\nIt is important to note that nutrition is a multi -sectoral issue that requires a multi -sectoral approach and \\nmulti -agency actions. Nutrition is intimately linked with the quality and qua ntity of food consumption.  \\nFood security and food -related nutrition issues including the problem of food adulteration is discussed in \\ndetail in Chapter 14. It is important, however, to note that nutrition is a multi -sectoral issue that requires \\nmulti -sectoral approach and multi -agency actions. Table 10.3 lists the major public sector agencies that \\nplay a role in the nations nutrition outcome. This multi -sectoral multi -agency approach was advocated in \\nthe 7FYP through the development and approval of several  policies and guidelines (e.g. NPAN2, CIP2, \\nNSSS, FSNP, 4th HPNSP), strengthening the enabling environment for nutrition security significantly . The \\n8FYP will build on the progress and strengthen the nutrition strategy to achieve the targeted nutrition \\noutcomes. The roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders for nutrition will be further specified, and \\narrangements of appropriate coordination and synergistic action will be made in line with the \\naforementioned enabling environment. Nutrition related poli cy guidance and inter/intra ministerial linkages \\nwill be facilitated through the revitalized Bangladesh National Nutrition Council (BNNC). Moreover, \\nexisting cabinet committees that address food and nutrition security will contribute to effective coordinat ion \\nof nutrition programming. The MoHFW will collaborate with the Ministry of LGRD&C, the Ministry of \\nAgriculture, and the Ministry of Food to address nutrition and food safety issues.  \\nTable 10.3: Multi -sectoral, Multi -agency Approach to Improving Nutritio n \\nDomain  Role and activity towards scaling up nutrition  Ministry /Division  \\nEducation  \\uf0b7 Incorporate nutrition and hygiene education in curriculum, including \\nschool vegetable garden and cooking demonstrations  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure regular Health and Nutrition Days in the s chool’s calendar  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure completion for girls’ education at least up to high school  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote and protect good dietary practices among children in places \\nwhere there are school feeding programmes  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve sanitation facilities in schools  Education, Health and  \\nFamily Welfare, \\nInformation  \\nWater and \\nsanitation  \\uf0b7 Contribute to increased levels of hand -washing and hygiene  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure availability of safe drinking water  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve availability of sanitary facilities in different settings  \\n\\uf0b7 Prioritise the availability of water  to women for agriculture and \\nfishing  Local Govt., Rural \\nDevelopment &  \\nCoop erative s, Health & \\nFamily Welfare, Water  \\nResources.  \\nFood  \\n \\uf0b7 Ensure improving availability of diverse foods of quality  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote best practice to ensure food safety in agriculture sect or, food \\nprocessing industries, food distribution system and in food value chain  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure adequate food safety regulatory framework in place and \\nmonitored  Food, Industry, Disaster \\nManagement  & Relief , \\nFisheries & Livestock,  \\nHealth & Family \\nWelfare, Agricult ure \\nAgriculture, \\nFisheries and \\nLivestock  \\n \\uf0b7 Improve production of diversified food (source of animal protein)  \\n\\uf0b7 Empower women to access agriculture extension services, resources  \\n\\uf0b7 Incorporate basic nutrition into agriculture extension training and \\ntasks  \\n\\uf0b7 Build a griculture extension and agriculture input supply system to \\nensure nutrition is considered in planning and implementation  Agriculture, Fisheries \\nand Livestock, Water \\nResources.    \\n \\n602 \\n Domain  Role and activity towards scaling up nutrition  Ministry /Division  \\nWomen and \\nchildren \\naffairs  \\uf0b7 Emphasis on empowerment of women to make decisions  about their \\nown and their children’s wellbeing  \\n\\uf0b7 Highlight child marriage/early pregnancy and childbearing, and their \\nharmful implications for nutrition  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure 6 -month fully paid maternity leave is implemented in all \\nsectors  Women and Children \\nAffairs, He alth and \\nFamily Welfare, \\nPrimary and Mass \\nEducation, Information  \\nIndustry  \\uf0b7 Increase availability of fortified staples e.g. salt and oil  \\n\\uf0b7 Adhere to high standards in advertising/marketing, focus on children  Industry, Food  and  \\nAgriculture  \\nEnvironment, \\nfores try and \\nnatural \\nresources  \\uf0b7 Restoring or enhancing natural resources  \\n\\uf0b7 Protecting forests, promoting forest -derived foods to benefit poor/ \\nwomen  \\n\\uf0b7 Securing ownership, access and management rights to land and other \\nproductive resources for poor or marginalised g roups (e.g. ethnic \\nminorities, emergency -affected populations)  \\n\\uf0b7 Pro-poor, efficient and integrated management of water resources \\nincluding control for negative impacts, such as water -borne diseases  \\n\\uf0b7 Risk mitigation and management of water -related shocks (e.g . \\ndroughts, floods, water insecurity) through adequate infrastructure, \\nstorage and flood control, supporting adaptation to the effects of \\nclimate change  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening early warning and nutrition surveillance systems  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase collaboration with other sector s and joint programming to \\nincrease household/community resilience, especially in emergencies  \\n\\uf0b7 Monitoring & evaluation systems include nutrition relevant indicators  Environment , Forest  \\nand Climate Change,   \\nChittagong Hill Tracts  \\nAffairs  \\nLaw and \\nJustice  \\uf0b7 Protect, promote and monitor rights and non -discrimination: right to \\nadequate food and to be able to feed oneself in dignity; and all other –\\nrelated rights ( employment, children’s rights , women’s rights , focus \\non marginalized groups, poor households and wome n) \\n\\uf0b7 Uphold refugee and humanitarian law in protracted crises  Women and Children   \\nAffairs, Law, Justice  \\nand Parli amentary  \\nAffairs   \\n \\nAddressing Child, Adolescent and Maternal Malnutrition  \\n \\nUnder the 8FYP, increased attention will be paid to the high rate of malnutrition among children, adolescent \\nand women of reproductive age and the elderly. This is also part of efforts to mainstream gender issues in \\nnutrition programmes. To that end, the Government will consider a multidimensional approach to address \\nthe in tergenerational health impact. Among other things, such an approach will include awareness on \\nchild/women nutrition, food value and food diversity. Nutrition -specific interventions, for example infant \\nand young child feeding, and promotion and distribution  of micronutrient supplementation such as iron-\\nfolic acid supplementation among pregnant, lactating women and adolescent girls to cover iron -deficiency \\nanaemia will be undertaken through health and family planning facilities. The national strategy for infa nt \\nand young child feeding will be implemented. Existing half -yearly Vitamin A capsules distribution for \\nchildren will be continued. Post -partum Vitamin A distribution to improve vitamin A status of neonates \\nthrough breast milk will be scaled up. Monitorin g of salt iodization will be strengthened. Zinc for treatment \\nof diarrhoea will be adequately promoted. Expansion of intestinal parasite treatment, including the \\ndistribution of albendazole tablets, along with a separate deworming programme will be conside red. With \\nthe coverage of IMCI, zinc tablets are expected to be freely provided to children with diarrhoea.    \\n \\n603 \\n Some activities to improve nutrition services will include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing high potency Vitamin, A supplementation and de -worming to children during mea sles \\nvaccination and to children 1 -5 years during national events and through fortification of food with \\nvitamin A, iron and iodine for children.  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing micronutrient supplementation to pregnant women (Iron folate) and Vitamin -A \\nsupplementation to moth ers and neonates at postnatal period.  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing nutritional education and counseling to adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating mothers \\non appropriate caring and feeding practices, breast -feeding, supplementary feeding, micronutrients, \\netc. \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen qua lity improvement of the wasting prevention and treatment programme, and other \\nnutrition services at facility level.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring expansion of community -based prevention approach of malnutrition with nutrition \\nservices through C - IMCI programmes  as preventive m easures to malnourishment along with \\nprogrammes  in the CCs and managing malnourished cases at community and facility level, IYCF, \\netc. \\n\\uf0b7 Improve positive nutrition practices through Social Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) \\nincluding awareness on uptake o f essential nutrition services from public and private facilities \\nand at community level, as well as on food safety and healthy diet, as well as complementary \\nissues such as water and sanitation, EPI, and prevention of NCDs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring timely and quality re porting and follow up of nutrition services  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening inter -sectoral and inter -OP collaboration and efficient program implementation for \\nnutrition.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduce/revise/strengthen education on nutrition and healthy diets for students in the curriculum  \\n\\uf0b7 Integrate growth monitoring and promotion in EPI platforms  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and strengthen the regulatory mechanism and ensure implementation of policies, action \\nplans, and acts on nutrition, food safety, and healthy diets.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase coverage of services by aligning w ith relevant services and interventions hosted by other \\nministries, such as Maternal Allowance and Lactating Mothers Allowance/Child Benefit \\nprogramme  \\n\\uf0b7 Expedite the recruitment of relevant nutrition staff where required at community and facility level  \\nCapac ity Building and Awareness  \\nTo improve the knowledge base and capacity of health personnel regarding nutrition, health and family \\nplanning workers as well as agricultural extension workers will be appropriately trained in nutrition \\neducation. This will ease  the mainstreaming of nutrition in health and family planning services through \\ncommunity clinics, union health and family welfare centres/sub -centres, Upazila health complexes, and \\nagriculture extension services. Capacity building in nutrition of Upazila h ealth and agriculture workers, \\nschool teachers and women farmers will be undertaken through the NNS Operational Plan of IPHN. \\nCommunity awareness regarding health and nutrition will be strengthened through disseminating messages. \\nCommunity based arrangemen ts will also promote preparation of low -cost nutritious recipes, processing   \\n \\n604 \\n and preservation of micronutrient rich foods. Issues that are supplementary and complementary to nutrition, \\nlike water and sanitation, dietary intake, EPI and health education will  be addressed through a \\ncomprehensive approach.  \\nMonitoring, evaluation and research  \\nStrengthen monitoring, evaluation and research to generate evidence to inform policy decisions by \\nimproving interoperability of routine information management systems, sur veys, assessments and \\nsurveillance, establish feedback mechanisms, and closely monitor provision and utilization of essential \\nnutrition services with innovative approaches to understand the level of sustainability and accountability in \\nterms of equity, acc ess, coverage and quality, to generate evidence for informed policy decisions.  \\n10.6 POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT  \\nBangladesh has already witnessed how changes in the population growth rate and the structure creates \\nopportunities along with challenges. Rapid reduc tion in the population growth rate and changes in the \\npopulation structure in Bangladesh over the past 48 years since independence due to successes of social \\npolicy interventions including progress with women empowerment and gender equality have driven dow n \\nchild mortality, maternal mortality and high fertility rates and extended life expectancy. The formulation \\nof PP2041 has given an opportunity to revisit the long -term role of population management during the next \\n20 years or so. The structure of the popu lation now and the one that will evolve in the next 20 years will \\nbe vastly different than 20 -30 years ago. The development context of UMIC and HIC are also very different \\nfrom the context of low income (1972 -2014) and LMIC (2015 - ongoing). Consequently, t he opportunities \\nand challenges are vastly different and need a strategic review for proper integration in the upcoming \\ndevelopment agenda, starting with the 8FYP.  \\n10.6.1  Progress in Population Management  \\nThe first post -independence National Population Cen sus of 1974 counted some 74 million Bangladeshis.  \\nThe Census found that the TFR was at a high 6.9 and the population growth rate was 2.5% per year. The \\nchild population (0 -14 age group) constituted 48% of the total population and the dependency ratio was a \\nhigh 100.  Life expectancy was a mere 48 years, infant mortality rate was an alarming 139 per thousand \\nlive births and maternal mortality rate was an astounding 750 per 100,000 live births (Table 10.4).  These \\ndismal population characteristics were indee d alarming. Bangladesh policy makers fought back with \\ndetermination. Less than 40 years later, the last Census done in 2011 found tremendous success with \\npopulation management.  The TFR fell dramatically to 2.3; population growth rate declined to 1.2%; lif e \\nexpectancy increased to 69 years. Infant mortality climbed down dramatically to 39.  Progress was also \\nmade in bringing down the incidence of maternal mortality, although this progress was relatively modest \\ncompared with other areas. The changing populat ion dynamics brought down the share of child population \\nto 35% and the dependency ratio fell drastically to 67%.  Sample survey data show that the progress with \\npopulation management has continued since the last Census (Table 10.4).   \\n \\n   \\n \\n605 \\n Table 10.4: Banglad esh Population Progress 1974 - 2019  \\nPopulation Indicators  1974  2011  2019  \\nTotal fertility rate (TFR)  6.9 2.1 2.0 \\nPopulation growth rate (%)  2.5 1.4 1.32 \\nLife expectancy  46.2 69.0 72.6 \\nInfant mortality rate (per 000 live births)  139 39.0 21 \\nMaternal mort ality rate (per 1,00,000 live births)  750 239 165 \\nShare of 0 -14 age group (%)  48.1 35.4 28.5 \\nDependency rate (%)  100.0  67.2 51.0 \\nSource:  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)  \\nThe UNFPA provides an annual update on the state of progress with the global population challenge.  It \\nprovides two summary tables on progress with the population management agenda adopted at the Cairo \\nConference (ICPD 1994).  One deals with progress with sexual and reproductive health rights and the other \\ndeals with the youth and adolescent agenda.  A third table compares progress with key demographic \\nindicators.  These three tables combined provides a snapshot of the progress made by Bangladesh relative \\nto the rest of the world in the area of population management in the context o f the ICPD framework and \\nalso provides a summary of the agenda moving forward.  \\nTable 10.5 provides an overview of the progress on the ICPD agenda for sexual and reproductive health \\nrights. The progress made by Bangladesh in the adoption of contraceptives c ompares favorably with the \\nworld average and is better than the average progress made in developing countries.  Importantly, this \\nprogress is better than the South Asian countries of India, Nepal and Pakistan. The Bangladesh performance \\nis however weak in the area of reduction of female mortality and birth attendance by skilled health \\npersonnel.  Compared to 1974,  Bangladesh has done well in reducing the incidence of maternal mortality \\nand compares favorably with the averages for both the world level and the  developing countries. But it is \\nsubstantially behind the solid performance achieved by the dynamic East Asian countries of Malaysia, \\nThailand and Vietnam in reducing the incidence of maternal mortality. Regarding birth attendance by \\ntrained staff, Banglad esh is lagging way behind and is even below the average performance secured by least \\ndeveloping countries.  This is a serious performance gap in an otherwise commendable performance record \\nthat requires urgent attention.  \\nTable 10.5: Bangladesh Progress wit h Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights ICPD Goals  \\nRegion / \\nCountries  Contraceptive \\nprevalence rate, \\nwomen aged 15 -\\n49, any method \\n(%) Contraceptive \\nprevalence rate, \\nwomen aged 15 -\\n49, modern \\nmethod (%)  Unmet need \\nfor family \\nplanning \\nwomen aged \\n15-49 Propor tion \\nof demand \\nsatisfied; \\nwomen \\naged 15 -49 Proportion \\nof demand \\nsatisfied \\nwith modern \\nmethods; \\nwomen aged \\n15-49 Maternal \\nmortality \\nratio \\n(MMR) \\n(deaths per \\n100,000 live \\nbirths)  Births \\nattended \\nby skilled \\nhealth \\npersonnel \\n(%) \\nYear  2019  2019  2019  2019  2019  2015 2017  \\nWorld  63 58 12 84 78 216 79 \\nMore developed \\nregions  68 61 10 88 79 12  \\nLess developed \\nregions  62 57 12 84 77 238  \\nLeast developed \\nregions  42 37 21 67 59 436 56 \\nAsia and Pacific  67 62 10 87 81 127 84 \\nBangladesh  64 57 11 85 76 176 50   \\n \\n606 \\n Region / \\nCountries  Contraceptive \\nprevalence rate, \\nwomen aged 15 -\\n49, any method \\n(%) Contraceptive \\nprevalence rate, \\nwomen aged 15 -\\n49, modern \\nmethod (%)  Unmet need \\nfor family \\nplanning \\nwomen aged \\n15-49 Propor tion \\nof demand \\nsatisfied; \\nwomen \\naged 15 -49 Proportion \\nof demand \\nsatisfied \\nwith modern \\nmethods; \\nwomen aged \\n15-49 Maternal \\nmortality \\nratio \\n(MMR) \\n(deaths per \\n100,000 live \\nbirths)  Births \\nattended \\nby skilled \\nhealth \\npersonnel \\n(%) \\nIndia  57 51 12 82 74 174 86 \\nPakistan  42 33 19 68 54 178 52 \\nSri Lanka  65 54 8 90 74 30 99 \\nNepal  54 48 22 71 63 258 58 \\nMalaysia  53 39 17 76 56 40 99 \\nThailand  78 76 6 93 90 20 99 \\nVietnam  79 65 6 94 77 54 94 \\nSource: UNFPA 2019  \\nComparative progress with the ICPD  goals for Adolescent and Youth is indicated in Table 10.6. Bangladesh \\nmade excellent progress on the education front for both boys and girls, but especially for girls. It achieved \\nnear universal primary education for female and in excess of net enrolment for male.  Female progress with \\nnet secondary enrolment also exceeded male, although there is still much room for growth to come close to \\n100% net secondary school enrolment for both boys and girls.  Importantly, the progress with girl’s \\neducation exceeds the average progress for the world and thee developing countries and is very close to the \\naverage for Asia and Pacific. Bangladesh is however lagging substantially behind in making progress in the \\nareas of child marriage and adolescent fertility rates.   \\nTable 10.6: Bangladesh Progress with Adolescent and Youth ICPD Goals  \\nCountries/ \\nRegions  Adolescent \\nbirth rate \\nper 1000 \\ngirls age  \\n15-19 Child \\nmarriage by \\n18 (%)  Net \\nenrolment \\nrate \\nprimary \\neducation \\nmale (%)  Net \\nenrolment \\nrate \\nprimary \\neducation \\nfemale (%)  Gender \\nparity \\nindex \\nprimary \\neducation  Net \\nenrolment \\nrate \\nsecondary \\neducation \\nmale (%)  Net \\nenrolment \\nrate \\nsecondary \\neducation \\nfemale (%)  Gender \\nparity \\nindex, \\nsecondary \\neducation  \\n \\n2018  2017  2017  2017  2017  2017  2017  2017  \\nWorld  44 21 92 90 0.98 66 66 1.00 \\nMore developed \\nregions  14  \\n97 97 1.00 93 93 1.01 \\nLess developed \\nregions  48  \\n91 89 0.98 62 62 0.99 \\nLeast developed \\nregions  91 40 83 80 0.96 38 36 0.95 \\nAsia and Pacific  28 26 95 94 0.99 67 68 1.02 \\nEast and Southern \\nAfrica  93 35 86 83 0.97 35 33 0.93 \\nWest a nd Central \\nAfrica  114 42 79 71 0.90 39 34 0.86 \\nBangladesh  74 59 92 98 1.07 57 67 1.17 \\nUNFPA 2019  \\nWhen it comes to the demographic progress, Bangladesh again scores very well. Its progress in reducing \\nTFR and the population growth rate outperforms the pr ogress made for the world, developing country and \\nthe East Asian country averages. Within South Asia, Bangladesh performance is better than performances   \\n \\n607 \\n in India, Nepal and Pakistan.  Only Sri Lanka does better along with the dynamic East Asian countries o f \\nThailand and Vietnam. Malaysia outperforms on life expectancy, but its performance falls short on TFR \\nand population growth rate. However, this is possibly a conscious Malaysian policy to encourage birth rates \\ngiven the excess demand situation and rising  wages in the labor market. In summary, Bangladesh has \\nachieved strong progress in improving its population management based on freedom of choice and women \\nempowerment.  Excellent progress has been made in lowering TFR, reducing the population growth rate,  \\nreducing infant mortality, raising life expectancy and increasing primary and secondary enrolments for \\ngirls.  The areas where further progress is needed includes lowering maternal mortality rate, increasing \\navailability of skilled birth attendants, reduc ing child marriage, lowering adolescent birth rates and \\naddressing comprehensively the menace of violence against women.  \\nTable 10.7: Comparative Progress with Demographic Indicators  \\nIndicators/ Countries  TFR  Population growth rate (%)  Life expectancy (ye ars) \\n2019  2019  2010 -19 \\nWorld  2.5 1.1 72 \\nMore developed regions  1.7 0.3 80 \\nLess developed regions  2.6 1.3 71 \\nLeast developed regions  3.9 2.4 65 \\nEast Asia and Pacific  2.1 1.0 72 \\nBangladesh  2.0 1.1 73 \\nIndia  2.3 1.2 69 \\nPakistan  3.3 2.0 67 \\nSri Lanka  2.0 0.4 76 \\nNepal  2.0 1.1 71 \\nMalaysia  2.0 1.6 76 \\nThailand  1.4 0.3 76 \\nVietnam  1.9 1.1 77 \\nSource: UNFPA 2019  \\n10.6.2  Demographic Dividend and Ageing  \\nDemographic window of opportunity is the period when the proportion of a country’s working age \\npopulatio n aged 15 to 64 years is pronounced compared with dependent populations, i.e. young dependent \\npopulation aged 0 to 14 years and old age dependent population aged 65 years and above.  This means that \\nnumbers of working people are larger than the non -working  population. Thus, other things being equal, this \\nis a more favorable situation for a country’s economic development.  In other words, it is a “sweet spot” of \\na country’s development. However, the duration of demographic window of opportunity differs from one \\ncountry to another depending on how it has gone through its Health and Demographic Transition.  In the \\ncase of Bangladesh, the share of country’s working age population started to increase vis -à-vis the total \\npopulation in 1978 which is the beginning o f its demographic window of opportunity. It will start to shrink \\nin 2035 -2036 which is the end of the country’s demographic window of opportunity.   \\n \\n   \\n \\n608 \\n Figure 10.1: Bangladesh Demographic Window  \\n \\nAlthough the age -wise population structure of Bangladesh is still “young” today, it will age very fast in the \\nnext several decades. Following Oizumi (2013) and others, a society is referred to as “ageing” if 7 per cent \\nof the total population is 65 and above. A society is transition to an “aged” stage when the shar e of 65 and \\nolder population in total population is 14 per cent. The time required for Bangladesh’s shift from an ageing \\nto an aged society following the above definition is shown in Figure 10.2. Bangladesh will transition to \\nageing in 2029, just 9 years f rom 2020. It will take only 18 years from “ageing” to shift to an “aged” society \\n(i.e. in 2047). The speed at which Bangladesh is likely to transition to “ageing” to “aged” stage in 18 years \\n(i.e. 2047―2029) that is faster than Asian advanced countries and  rich European countries (see Figure \\n10.3). This is by far one of the fastest speeds of ageing compared with both historical (e.g.  France, UK, \\nGermany, and Sweden) and contemporary data of other countries. The above statistics also suggest that \\nBangladesh  may experience transition at a much lower stage of development compared to the Asian \\nadvanced countries and European rich countries where transition took place at significantly advantage \\nstages of their development.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n -1.50-1.00-0.500.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.50\\nWorking-age growth rate Population growth rateBeginning of Demographic \\nwindow 1978\\nEnd of \\nDemographic window \\n2033    \\n \\n609 \\n Figure 10.2: Population Ageing Tr ends in Bangladesh  \\nBangladesh population aged 65 and older  Transition speed (number of Years)  \\n  \\n  Source: UNICEF (2020), “Emerging Trends and Implications for Policy: Demographic Diversity of Bangladesh”  \\nAn implication of the ageing trend is that, the  potential support ratio – the number of working age population \\n(15 to 64) required to support one elderly person (65+) – has declined and projected to decline even faster \\nin future (Figure 10.3). In 1960, about 20 working age persons were supporting 1 sen ior dependent – a \\ndecline of 35 percent in support ratio over 59 years (i.e. 2019―1960). The support ratio fell to 13 by 2019. \\nBy 2040, this ratio will become 6 persons of working age to 1 senior dependent, i.e. half of today’s ratio in \\n21 years calculatin g from 2019.  Finally, by 2065, this ratio will become 3 persons of working age to 1 \\nsenior dependent – ¼ of today’s ratio in 46 years, calculating from 2019.  This will be feasible only if the \\nproductivity of today ‘s children becomes twice and four times  higher than today’s adults by the time they \\nbecome adults themselves – hence the need to make prioritized and highly time -sensitive investment in \\ntoday’s children for them to be equal to these challenges. Today, Bangladesh is standing at a cross road for \\nits sustainable development. She needs to make prioritized investment for the nation’s human resource \\ndevelopment, particularly in social sector encompassing health, nutrition, WASH, education, early \\nchildhood development and protection of children and wom en in a highly time -sensitive manner.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0\\n2000\\n2005\\n2010\\n2015\\n2020\\n2025\\n2030\\n2035\\n2040\\n2045\\n2050\\n2055\\n2060\\n2065\\n2070Percentage of population aged 65+Aged start in \\n2047Ageing start \\nin 2029\\n1718201818242630404785115\\n020406080100120\\nSingapore\\nBangladesh\\nBangladesh (BBS)\\nVietnam\\nSouth Korea\\nJapan\\nTaiwan\\nHong Kong\\nSweden\\nUK\\nGermany\\nFrance  \\n \\n610 \\n Figure 10.3: Number of Working -age Persons (15 -64 Years) Supporting One Old Age Person (65 \\nYears +) in Bangladesh  \\n \\n     Source: UNICEF (2020), “Emerging Trends and Implications for Policy: Demographic Diversity of Bangladesh”  \\n10.6.3  Challenges on the Population Front  \\nDespite progress, a number of challenges have also emerged. On the population front, the population growth \\nrate at 1.3% per year is still on the high side.  Despite successes in reaching out familie s on sexual and \\nreproductive health interventions, the adoption of modern contraceptive practices is uneven across districts.  \\nSolid progress has been made on women empowerment, especially in eliminating gender parity in primary \\nand secondary enrolment. Ye t gender gaps in tertiary education and employment remain. Despite laws, \\nearly girl -child marriage and violence against women prevail.  On the development front, employment \\ngrowth has slowed in recent years, the youth unemployment rate is very high, there is a very large proportion \\nof youth who are not in employment, education or training (NEET), female labor force participation rate \\nremains low, the quality of education is weak, healthcare facilities and affordability are inadequate relative \\nto the needs o f the changing population, and social security outreach is not very responsive to the life cycle \\nrisks of the changing population age structure12 These suggest that the changing demographic dynamics \\nhave not been fully internalized in the development strate gy and the associated policy making. Challenges \\nin population front are summarised below:  \\n1. Child marriage is still very high (below 18 for girls) that contributes to a high adolescent fertility \\nrate  \\n2. Adoption of modern contraceptive practices still low rela tive to Asian countries and uneven \\nprogress across districts, rural, urban, income groups and age groups  \\n3. The incidence of maternal mortality still too high  \\n4. At only 59% (MICS 2019), the attendance of skilled staff during birth is among the lowest in the wor ld \\n                                                     \\n12  The Bangladesh Employment Challenge Policy Briefs , Sadiq Ahmed, Report Prepared for World  Bank and the ILO, July 2020. \\nAlso, Implications of Emerging Demographic Profile for Bangladesh Developm ent Strategy, Sadiq Ahmed and Bazlul \\nKhondker, Report Prepared for UNFPA, Dhaka, February 2020.  \\n \\n   \\n \\nDouble in 20 years  Quadruple \\nin 40 years  \\n 30% more onus in 60 years    \\n \\n611 \\n 5. High incidence of gender -based violence (GBV) - a serious threat to the progress with the women \\nempowerment agenda  \\n6. The gender gap in tertiary education and vocational training remains substantial  \\n7. Bangladesh is ageing fast - major challenges for old -age pension support and geriatric health care \\nand Bangladesh is not well -prepared for either of the two challenges.   \\n10.6.4  Population Program in the 8FYP  \\nThe 8FYP is the first plan aimed at implementing the PP2041. It is expected that the 8FYP will incorpor ate \\nthe changing population dynamics and the associated population management agenda in defining the \\nnational and sectoral development strategies and policies for FY2021 -FY2025. Based on the analysis of the \\nReport and the summary presented above, the polic y reforms related to population management and the \\nassociated implications for development for the 8FYP  can be summarised as follows.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the outreach and campaign on sexual education and reproductive health issues to increase \\nthe adoption of modern  contraceptive practices with special attention to the lagging districts, the rural \\npoor, the urban slums and the adolescent girls. The rural health clinics (Community Health Clinics and \\nUnion Health and Family Welfare Centers) need to be adequately staffe d and equipped to meet the \\ndemand for modern contraceptive devices and counselling. Partnership with NGO -based community \\nhealth workers should be strengthened to reach out the women in the urban slums and to provide \\nservices to rural women at the door step .  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance the capacity to increase the percentage of births attended by trained staff from 59% to 72% by \\nthe end of the 8FYP by increasing resources and staffing in the rural health clinics and the district level \\nhospitals.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the implementati on of the law against child marriage with support from local government \\nagencies, education staff, NGO -based health and social workers and the community leaders. The full \\nlegal provisions should be enforced against violating families. Education campaign ag ainst child \\nmarriage should be enhanced through use of national TVs and the print media.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Undertake a comprehensive study on estimating the economic cost of Gender based Violence (GBV) \\nfocusing on direct, indirect and induced economic costs for both publi c and private sectors.  The study \\nshould also provide a holistic strategy and policy framework for addressing GBV drawing on good \\npractice international examples. Bangladesh may formulate strategies in line with the ‘whole system’ \\nthat focuses on all three  important aspects: prevention, provision and protection.  This is a high -priority \\nagenda for the 8FYP.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The ongoing demographic transition will continue to support a faster growth of labor force than the \\npopulation growth. In addition to continuing with e fforts to further increase the rate of growth of GDP, \\nthe recent slowdown in the growth of employment must be arrested by increasing efforts to increase \\nthe employment elasticity of GDP growth. Important policies include spurring the growth of RMG by \\nrever sing the sharp appreciation of the real exchange rate and reducing the cost and improving the \\nquality of infrastructure and trade logistic services; sharply lowering trade protection to reduce the anti -\\nexport bias of trade policies and promote export diver sification; and promote the growth of a dynamic \\ncottage , micro, small and medium enterprises (CMS MEs) sector through improved access to \\ninstitutional credit and other supportive measures.    \\n \\n612 \\n      \\n\\uf0b7 The female labor force participation has stagnated at around 36 % and is considerably lower than the \\nrate found in East Asian economies. The government should seek to increase female labor force \\nparticipation rate to around 64% by FY2041 as found in South Korea.  For the 8FYP , the corresponding \\ntarget should be about 4 3%. The policies noted above relating to education, training and women \\nempowerment including actions against GBV should help. Additionally, to enable labor force \\nparticipation of young mothers, efforts should be made to increase the supply of low -cost day care \\nfacilities. This could be done in collaboration with private enterprises and NGOs.    \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The youth employment challenge will increase progressively as demographic changes continue.  This \\nrequires urgent policy attention to ensure that the demographic di vidend is not wasted.  A detailed \\nreview and policy analysis of the youth employment challenge have been done in December 2019 based \\non the request from ILO. The main policy recommendations relevant to the 8FYP  include: strengthen \\neducation quality through  sharp increases in public spending on education and training; enter into \\nformal partnerships with private sector, donors and NGOs in increasing the job relevance of training; \\npromote the spread of ICT by reducing high taxation; promote self -employment of youth through \\nentrepreneurship based on training and access to institutional credit; and support international migration \\nin districts that are not benefitting from this facility through training, finance and information.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The rapidly growing ageing populat ion needs strong policy attention. It requires policies to support the \\nincome of the old -age population and policies to support their healthcare and physical well -being needs. \\nBangladesh has an Old Age Allowance (OAA) program that is poorly targeted and mi sses out most of \\nthe poor and vulnerable population. The monthly allowance is also well below the poverty income \\nlevel. The changing population dynamics will sharply increase the size of the ageing population and \\nwill challenge the already strained fiscal capacity. On the health care front, Bangladesh does not have \\nthe readiness to address the growing needs of the old -age population. Among the reforms needed \\nduring the 8FYP  include: consider redefining the old age for retirement and pensions purposes from 60 \\nplus years to 65 plus years as per international convention; implement the Old Age Program as defined \\nunder the NSSS 2015; consider implementing a universal old age pension scheme based on a \\ncombination of public and private funding and partly voluntary  as explained in the Report; consider \\nmoving towards an universal health care (UHC) system that uses a mix of publicly and privately funded \\nhealth insurance  and low -cost public health care facilities.  \\n \\nFamily Planning (FP)  \\nProgress with the implementatio n of the highly successful family planning activities will continue in the \\n8FYP with focus on reaching out the less -served areas and adolescent girls who face the greatest risk of \\nearly pregnancies. The main activities will include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Gear up all kinds of ac tivities for achieving FP related targets by 2025 through increasing use of \\nCPR by 75%, institutional delivery by 72% by the SBAs and through 24/7 services, etc. Also \\nreducing dropout rates and unmet needs to 15% and 8% respectively.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen urban FP se rvices by expanding FP, mother, child, reproductive and adolescent health \\nservices in the city corporations.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expand unit -wise FP activities in the Sitmahals.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish additional adolescent friendly 200 service centres.    \\n \\n613 \\n \\uf0b7 Implementation of eMIS activities; D HIS2 activities; e -Filling activities in DGFP, etc. all over the \\ncountry.  \\n\\uf0b7 Digitalization of the registration of all FP related NGOs working with DGFP.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishment of new physical facilities & up -gradation of existing ones and repair and \\nmaintenance of t he facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgradation of Maternal and Child Welfare Centers (MCWCs) for increasing institutional \\ndelivery and quality Maternal, Child, Reproductive and Adolescent Health (MCRAH) services \\nthrough 24/7 service.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expansion of FP service in City Corporatio n, pouroshova, cantonment areas, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Prevention of child marriage and delay of first birth to get the best of Demographic dividend.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting setting up of contraceptive manufacturing plant such as Implant, IUD for availability of \\nproduct as and when requ ired. \\n10.6.5  Harnessing Demographic Dividend in the 8FYP  \\n\\uf0b7 Demography is not destiny. At the same time, it does set clear and strong parameters within which \\ncountries need to make conscious decisions and take actions in a time -bound manner. Countries need \\nto make the best out of a given situation in one demographic stage and be well prepared for \\nopportunities and challenges for the next stage.  Based on the above -mentioned analysis, it is right; \\njustifiable and necessary both morally and economically to inve st in Children as an act of “ paying \\nforward ” to the future generations who will support us in our old age and continue to develop our \\nsociety in future – concept and practice of old -age benefit has been well accepted by now as a legitimate \\nact of “ paying a fterward ” to those who worked hard and supported us in our young age. This \\nperspective is much need for Bangladesh today.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Nutritional deficiency hampers early childhood development with lasting impact on productivity and \\nlife time earnings. Despite progre ss, there are concerns with regards to current state of Nutrition \\n(Stunting, Wasting and Underweight) among children in Bangladesh. Poverty and lack of awareness \\nare two identifiable sources of nutritional deficiency in Bangladesh. Adequate and effective i nvestment \\nin Health and Social Protection is required to improve the situation. Bangladesh must at least investt 2 \\nper cent of GDP on Health from existing level of less than 1 per cent of GDP within the 8FYP period. \\nSimilarly, investment in Social protecti on should be increased to 2 per cent of GDP by the end of 8FYP \\nfrom the current 1.2 per cent of GDP (excluding civil service pensions). A large part of the additional \\nallocation (i.e. 0.8 per cent of GDP) should go to Child focused social protection progra mmes.   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 A large number of global evidences envisaged that economic expansions are positively associated with \\neducational attainment not just in later stages in life but also during the early childhood. In the context, \\nBangladesh must increase the investme nt in education from 2.5 per cent of GDP in FY2019 to at least \\n3.5 per cent by the end of 8FYP.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Finally, it is imperative to point to the urgency and time sensitivity of these investments. The window \\nof oppor tunity is short in Bangladesh. Following cons iderations are critical:  \\na) Demographic window of opportunity in Bangladesh will close within 15 years. Against the \\nbackdrop of the rapid process of ageing, Bangladesh must learn from the experience of ageing   \\n \\n614 \\n societies struggling to maintain social security systems by adopting a strategy to ensure old -age \\nsupport through recognizing the critical role of immediate investing in children.  \\nb) To attain these gains, it is essential for Bangladesh to invest in children now as the time left to reap \\nthe benefits of the  demographic window of opportunity is finite with  \\nc) Bangladesh already passed 66 per cent of the window of demographic opportunity in 2020 that \\nopened in the early 1980s and is projected to cease in 2035 -36. Therefore, adequate and effective \\ninvestment on C hildren now is an absolutely necessity to make best use of remaining 18 years of \\nthe window.  \\nd) Bangladesh’s transition has progressed in terms of fertility and mortality even while the nation is \\nat a rela tively low stage of development. The demographic tra nsition started in Bangladesh while \\nage at marriage and first birth remained low, which may present a new kind of opportunity. There \\nis thus room for investments in policies to prolong the demographic window of opportunity through \\nlater age at marriage and  later births.  \\n10.7 DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN THE 8th PLAN  \\nThe rapid response to COVID -19 and the need to sharply enhance the health sector capacity of Bangladesh \\ncalls for substantial increase in budget and ADP allocations. The ADP allocations have been designed to \\nmeet the 8FYP target to increase health care spending from 0.7% of GDP in FY2019 to 2.0% of GDP by \\nFY2025. Accordingly, the planned development resource allocations in current prices and FY2021 constant \\nprices are shown in Table 10.8 and 1 0.9.  The ADP allocations undergo a steep increase to meet the \\nhealthcare objectives of the 8FYP.  \\nTable 10.8: ADP Allocations for Health Development in the Eighth Plan  \\n(Taka billion current prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nHealth Serv ices Division  151.7  195.8  252.7  310.4  372.4  \\nMedical Education and Family Welfare \\nDivision  18.4 22.6 26.1 30.4 36.5 \\nTotal Health Sector  170.0  218.4  278.7  340.8  408.9  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 10.9: ADP Allocations for Health Deve lopment in the Eighth Plan  \\n(Taka billion FY2021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nHealth Services Division  151.7  186.0  228.3  267.2  306.1  \\nMedical Education and Family Welfare \\nDivision  18.4 21.5 23.5 26.2 30.0 \\nTotal Health Sec tor 170.0  207.5  251.8  293.4  336.1  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 11 : \\nEDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n617 \\n CHAPTER 11 \\nEDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY  \\n11.1 INTRODUCTION  \\nEducation sector development is crucial for building human c apital of a country. Theoretically, a country \\ncan sustain economic growth even without technological progress by accumulating human and physical \\ncapital. Research shows that the return to education is higher in developing countries. Investing in education \\nhas shown remarkably strong persistence across generations, which makes education -interventions an \\neffective policy tool worldwide. Moreover, human capital helps countries in their structural transformation \\nfrom agrarian to manufacturing and service -based economies and regarded as the key driver of inclusive \\ngrowth, poverty and inequality reduction and social development particularly in developing countries.  \\nAs elaborated in Part 1 of the 8FYP document, Bangladesh achieved remarkable success in acceleratin g \\ngrowth, lowering poverty and improving human development during the Sixth and Seventh Five Year \\nPlans.  The associated education and training sector strategies and policies played a major role in securing \\nthese achievements. These strategies and policies  were guided by the PP2021 and the National Education \\nPolicy 2010 (NEP). The Plans emphasized on providing appropriate education and training to a large group \\nof the population; expanding coverage in both urban and rural areas, to both males and females; i mproving \\nquality of education; increasing availability of technical and vocational education and ICT education; and \\naddressing the dropout rates. Evidence shows that in recent years Bangladesh has made remarkable progress \\nin providing education to its citi zens; the literacy rate has risen substantially and the share of the workforce \\nwith secondary, higher secondary and tertiary education has also risen.  \\nBuilding on the success of PP2021, Bangladesh has now embarked on implementation of PP2041.  The \\nhuman c apital development challenges underlying PP2041 is enormous. While a semi -skilled workforce \\nwith basic education has served Bangladesh well in its structural transformation from agriculture to \\nindustry, as the country looks to accelerate growth and develop  further to secure UMIC status by FY2031, \\nthe focus beyond literacy rates and universal primary enrolment will become necessary. It is critically \\nimportant that Bangladesh avoids the so called ‘middle -income trap.’ International examples indicate that \\ncoun tries that were able to rapidly escape the middle -income trap are almost exclusively those that invested \\nheavily in education and skill development. Currently, Bangladesh is experiencing the ‘demographic \\ndividend’ in addition to the fact that more than thi rty per cent  of the population is less than 15 years old. If \\nthis age group is not converted into a workforce equipped with the required skills, the potential \\ndemographic -dividend may become a wasted opportunity. This highlights the importance of having a robust \\nand holistic education strategy with regulatory framework. In addition to continuing the successful policies \\nof the previous plans, the 8FYP will articulate the strategies and policies to address the challenges in the \\neducation sector.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n618 \\n 11.2 HUMAN CAPI TAL AND ECONOMIC GROWTH  \\nHuman ‘capital’ refers to a set of skills or abilities, which a worker possesses through education, training, \\nand experience that can be ‘rented out’ to employers. Higher investments in human capital increase \\nworker’s productivity w ith a resulting positive effect on economic growth. The relative demand of these \\nskills and abilities determine how much is paid for it - the labour  wage. As the structure of an economy \\nchanges with technological changes, certain workers become redundant w hile others with different skills -\\nset become high in demand. This is why, as a country transitions from one type of economy to another its \\nfurther development requires better ‘human resources’ with higher skills and abilities. While during the \\npreliminary years of development basic education may be sufficient for the economy, that does not hold \\ntrue as the economy expand and interact in the global arena. To achieve sustained economic growth, the \\ncountry’s human capital base has to grow and this is done by d eveloping the education system, updating \\npedagogy, and equipping the graduates with training and experience to acquire new skills and abilities that \\nthe growing economy needs.  \\nKnowledge and skills are acquired in three -stages. In the first stage, acquisiti on of human capital is mostly \\ndone passively, through the actions of others. Family environment, social norms, culture, and early \\nschooling all impart human capital including basic verbal and numerical skill, attitude towards learning, \\netc. However, the im portance of cognitive and behavioural  development at this stage is crucial. In the \\nsecond stage, young adults actively absorb knowledge and skills from schools, universities, vocational \\ntraining centres , etc. In the third phase, adults enter the job market  and accumulate human capital through \\nlearning -by-doing, work experience, part -time programmes , training schemes, night schools, etc. The \\neducation policy of Bangladesh necessarily seeks to encourage participation in all these three phases.  \\nThe East Asian countries are a good example of how investment in human capital contributed to their \\nmiraculous economic growth. Before 1960s these countries were very poor. What they did, particularly \\nSouth Korea, invested heavily in basic education, along with other eco nomic and social policy measures. \\nWorkforce with basic competencies through primary education helped in the initial phases of growth in \\nSouth Korea. The government facilitated the scaling -up of human capital (secondary education, vocational \\ntraining, etc.)  at later stages of development of the country. Similarly, other East Asian countries witnessed \\nalong their growth path respective government’s high investment in education for its population. Vietnam, \\nsimilarly, has achieved literacy and numeracy levels t hat are comparable to that of developed countries. \\nThese focuses  on human development have been attributed as one of the main reasons of their impressive \\ndevelopment success.  \\nFor Bangladesh, research shows that growth in the average wage rate has been lar gely driven by rise in \\nwage of unskilled workers, narrowing the gap between wages of workers with secondary and tertiary \\neducation and workers with no -education. This may be the reason why enrolment and completion at the \\nsecondary and higher education leve ls have not increased at the desired rate and why the average number \\nof years of schooling in Bangladesh remains low (5.1 years) compared to other South -Asian countries \\n(India, 5.8 years; Sri Lanka 10.9 years; etc.). This needs to be changed as the economy  is transitioning \\ntowards a service -based economy, which will require a different type of workers. However, when the \\ndemand pattern changes, the education sector has to stand ready to deliver a different composition of \\ngraduates. This points to  the need fo r a long -term hum an capital development policy, o therwise, rigidities \\nin the sector may act as a constraint to growth of the country.    \\n \\n619 \\n 11.3 EDUCATION SECTOR PROGRESS DURING THE SEVENTH FIVE YEAR \\nPLAN AND EMERGING CHALLENGES  \\nAccording to the latest labour  force s urvey 2016 -17, 31 per cent  of the population under 15 years and above \\nin Bangladesh does not have a primary education. However, high enrolment and completion rates in primary \\neducation in recent years indicate that this illiteracy comes mostly from older c ohorts. Urban illiteracy is \\nlower (22 per cent ) than rural (34.8 per cent ). At the pre -primary level, enrolment  is low but the trend is on \\nthe rise. At the primary level, gender -gap exists with the literacy rate but gender -parity in enrolment and \\ncompletio n of primary education has been achieved in recent years, indicating that this gap will continue to \\nnarrow. Gender parity is also achieved in the secondary level. However, enrolment in science subjects at \\nthe higher secondary level has become lower.  Under  the madrasa stream, the more popular Qawmi schools \\noperate entirely independently, free from government initiatives, which remain as a concern for quality.  \\nAt the higher/tertiary education level, the number of students, teachers, and institutions has inc reased \\nrapidly in recent years. However, the preparedness of the workforce for the Fourth Industrial Revolution \\n(4IR)  needs to be enhanced , as there is lack of interest in STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering and \\nMathematics) subjects among students. Tec hnical and vocational education and training (TVET) is also not \\nvery popular among students as being considered a second -class education system. Industry -academia \\ncollaboration is often missing, generating skill gap and unemployable graduates.  \\n11.3.1  Prog ress in Pre -Primary and Early Childhood Education  \\nThe government under the 7FYP identified investment in pre -schooling schemes as a tool to reduce \\ninequality and disparity in society. Studies have shown that the exposure to pre -primary and early childhood \\neducation leads to better cognitive, numerical, and literacy skills later in life. Early evidence in Bangladesh \\nshows that pre -primary school children perform better on language and vocabulary, verbal reasoning and \\nnonverbal reasoning, basic numeracy, and school readiness. Enrolment  in pre -primary increased from 0.9 \\nmillion in 2010 to 1.7 million in 2018. Another 1.9 million students received pre -primary education from \\nother types of institutions. Recent data shows that the percentage of grade -1 students wi th pre -primary \\neducation increased almost double in less than ten years; from 42.25 per cent  in 2010 to 92.7 per cent  on \\n2018 (Table 11.1)  \\nIn 2019, the proportion of under -5 years of age children who are developmentally on track in health, \\nlearning, and ps ychosocial well -being was 74.5 per cent . The enrolment of special needs children in the \\nmainstream primary education is one of the core elements of the PEDP -IV. A total of 25,156 special needs \\nchildren were enrolled in the DPE managed pre -primary classes i n 2018.  \\nTable 11.1: Grade 1 Students with Pre -Primary Education (%)  \\nStudents  2010  2014  2018  \\nBoys  40.58  50.55  91.6 \\nGirls  43.94  51.63  93.5 \\nAll 42.25  51.07  92.7 \\nSource:  Annual Primary School Census, 2010, 2014 and 2018    \\n \\n620 \\n The major challenge  in pre -primary  and early childhood education are training of teachers, since type of \\npedagogy necessary at the pre -primary level is substantially different from the primary (or higher) levels of \\neducation. Initiatives must be taken to improve the quality of teachers eng aged in pre -primary education.   \\n11.3.2  Progress in Primary Education  \\nPrimary education in Bangladesh comprises of grade -1 to grade -5 levels. Most key indicators in primary \\neducation have moved up over the 6FYP and the 7FYP. In 2018, a total of 17.3 million  children were \\nenrolled in both government and non -government primary schools. Net enrolment rate in primary education \\nhas been hovering around the 97.7 per cent  to 97.9 per cent  region since 2014. This trend is visible for both \\nmale and female, with growt h rate stagnated at around 97 per cent  and 99 per cent  respectively, as opposed \\nto the PP2021 goal of 100 per cent  enrolment by FY2021. However, gender parity has been achieved. \\nAnnual dropout rate has fallen gradually from a high 50 per cent  in 2006 to le ss than 20 per cent  by 2018. \\nReduction in the student -teacher ratio has been another success story of the sector, coming down from 42 \\nin 2012 to 25 in 2018. 34 per cent  of primary schools have adapted infrastructure and material for students \\nwith disabilit ies.  \\n The number of teachers in the government primary schools has gradually increased from 215,000 in 2012 \\nto 349,000 in 2018. The proportion of trained teachers in primary education has also increased over time. \\nUnder the provision of PEDP -IV in 2018, a round 92.7 per cent  Head and Assistant Teachers received the \\nsubject -based training. The number of primary institutions has also increased. In 2012, total number of \\nprimary schools in Bangladesh was 104,017 including the government, non -government, madrasa  and NGO \\nmanaged primary schools. The number of the primary schools has gradually increased to 134,147 by 2018. \\nThis increase has been primarily due to the rise in number of public schools.  \\nThe government has taken major steps to improve the quality of pri mary education. Considerable progress \\nwas made in terms of teacher training and recruitment, upgrading of textbooks, introduction of ICT along \\nwith internet connections and distribution of laptops, and improved school facilities. To continue with this \\nprogress, the PEDP -IV was launched in July 2018 with an aim of providing quality primary education to \\nall Bangladeshi children by enhancing institutional management through decentralization. The PEDP -IV \\nenvisages that all children in the appropriate age group will participate in pre -primary and primary \\neducation and acquire necessary skills and learning from school. Importantly, families of these children \\nwill be given incentives so that they can continue sending their children to school.  \\nThe Primary Education  Stipend Project (PESP) was introduced in 2002 to provide a fixed monthly stipend \\nto the mothers of primary education students meeting certain performance and need -based  conditionalities. \\nThis scheme was universalized in 2016 and no longer poses a challeng e of targeting of beneficiaries th rough \\nthe eligibility criteria. However, the monthly stipend of BDT 100 per month was set in 2002 and has not \\nbeen revised upwards since. In addition, indirect and overhead costs continue to be very high. To reduce \\noverhea d cost, since mid -2017, the government has been transferring the stipends directly to the mobile \\nbanking accounts of nearly 10 million mothers of 13 million children enrolled in the project.  \\nDistribution of free textbooks to primary and secondary students is an on -going and popular practice of the \\ngovernment. In December 2019, more than 350 million textbooks were distributed to more than 40 million \\nstudents for the academic year 2020. This annual event started in 2009 and has since distributed 2.2 billion   \\n \\n621 \\n books to students. Moreover, more than three million students in 15,700 primary schools are covered under \\nthe National School Meal Policy, which provides midday meals to students to meet a minimum 30 per cent  \\ncalories and 50 per cent  micronutrient needs of primary school going students. The target is to bring students \\nof all government primary schools under the universal midday meal coverage by 2023. In addition, a review \\nof primary education is being undertaken to modernize the curriculum and introduce new educational \\nactivities at the primary schools.  \\nUnder the PEDP -III, leadership trainings were provided to 60,000 head teachers. Computer with Internet \\nconnectivity has been provided to 1,139 field offices associated with primary education management and \\nICT education has around 35,000 teachers and 400 officers. Modern ICT lab has been set up in over 50 \\nPrimary Teachers’ Training Institutes (PTI). Laptops, multimedia projectors, sound systems, and modems \\nhave been provided in around 8,925 classrooms in 5,432 public elementary schools.  \\nOverall, substantial progress has been made in terms of school enrolment rate, which is close to 100 per \\ncent. Dropout rate also decreased to below 20 per cent  and repetition rate is below 10 per cent .  Gender \\nparity in enrolment  has been achieved. Schemes such as stipend distribution to mothers of primary students \\nthrough mobile banking have been undertaken to encourage increased participation by students/families \\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds.  Progress has been made on quality  front through supply of better inputs \\nlike materials and supplies, teacher training and introduction of ICT.   \\nMajor Challenges  \\nDespite the progress made during the 7FYP, some challenges remain. Eliminating the dropout rate, which \\nis still high (at almost  20 per cent  and the rate is higher for girls than boys) is necessary to achieve \\ngovernment’s objective of Education for All (EFA). Absenteeism is also high, among both students and \\nteachers. School contact hours for grade 3 and grade 5 were set 791 hours in a year, according to Annual \\nSector Performance Report (ASPR) 2019 report, which is below the standard of many developing nations. \\nInternational standard recommends having 1,000 hours of teaching time at primary level.  \\nThe average pass rate of Primary Ed ucation Completion Examination (PECE) increased from 92 per cent  \\nin 2010 to 97 per cent  in 2018. However, the National Student Assessment (NSA) suggests that the students \\ndo not learn much at the primary level. NSA findings suggest that learning competenci es are drastically \\nlower for students in grade -5 compared to students in grade -3 in mathematics and Bangla. In Bangla, \\nstudents tend to score around 70 per cent  in grade 3, which falls sharply to 25 per cent  by grade 5. In \\nMathematics, grade 3 students got  41percent in 2015 and 2017, much lower than the 50 per cent  and 58 per \\ncent in 2011 and 2013, indicating a worsening trend. By grade 5, the math learning situation deteriorates \\neven more, with the students scoring a high 33 per cent  in 2011 and low 10 per cent in 2015.  \\nData from the latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Sample Survey (MICS) 2019 suggests that despite progress \\nthe quality of primary education continues to present a major challenge.  Regarding the quality of \\neducation, reading and numeracy skills  are taken into consideration for children aged 7 -14 years as \\nreported in MICS 2019.  Quality is assessed by using two indicators to assess the reading skills and three \\nindicators for numeracy skills. For reading, the indicators include ‘not being able to correctly read 90 per \\ncent of words in a story’ and ‘not being able to demonstrate foundational reading skills’. For numeracy, the \\nindicators are ‘not being able to read numbers’, ‘not being able to discriminate numbers’ and ‘not being   \\n \\n622 \\n able to recognize an d complete patterns. Results in these respects are not encouraging. More than one -third \\nof children couldn’t correctly read words in a story and more than half of the children failed to demonstrate \\nfoundational reading skills. For numeracy, once again, mor e than one -third of the children couldn’t \\nsuccessfully complete the tasks of number reading and number discrimination, and about two -third couldn’t \\ncomplete the task of pattern recognition. These clearly indicate that the average competence level of the \\nchildren is rather poor, and hence the quality of education is really a matter of concern.  \\nFigure 11.1: Indicators of Primary Education Quality (2018)  \\n \\n          Source: MICS 2019  \\n11.3.3  Progress in Secondary Education  \\nSecondary education occupies an import ant place between the different stages of education in Bangladesh. \\nStudents with primary education view secondary education as a bridge through which to improve their job \\nreadiness. For others, secondary education represents the bridge through which they m ove on to tertiary \\nand other higher education. With the expansion of the primary education across the country, and steady rise \\nin completion rates, the demand for secondary education has also increased.  \\nEnrolment rates in the secondary level have gone up for both boys and girls in recent years. There were \\nover 20,000 institutions offering secondary education to 10. 3 million students in 201 9, with the help of \\n246,845  teachers. Out of the 10.5 million enrolled students, 5.6 million ( 54.41  per cent ) were girl s indicating \\nthat gender parity has been achieved. This ratio has experienced gradual rise over the past decade. At the \\nbeginning of the millennium, secondary enrolment rate for girls was less than 40 per cent . Enrolment has \\nnow reached 70 per cent , more t han the same rate for male students. Schemes such as the Female Secondary \\nSchool Assistance Program (FSSAP) I and II and Higher Secondary Female Stipend Project (HSFSP), \\nwhich aimed to increase female enrolment through financial assistance, have played key  roles in making \\nthis turnaround in female secondary enrolment possible. However,  completion rate at the secondary level \\nis low, around 6 4 per cent , and this rate is noticeably higher for boys than girls. 21.77 per cent  secondary \\nschools have adopted infra structure and material for students with disabilities. The government aims to \\nreach 80 per cent  by the end of 2025.  38.151.238.234.764.2\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70Percentage who couldn’t correctly read \\n90% of words in a storyPercentage who couldn’t demonstrate \\nfoundational reading skillsNumber readingNumber discriminationPattern recognition and completion  \\n \\n623 \\n ICT courses in secondary education have been introduced as well as setting up computer centres  in \\ninstitutions and providing training to tea chers to use them. The Ministry of Education (MoE) and the \\nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MoPME) has undertaken two initiatives, Multimedia Classroom \\n(MMC) and Teacher -led Digital Content Development. Digitalization of classrooms is currently an \\nambitious on-going  venture operating through two separate projects under MoE and MoPME. These \\nprojects are aimed at establishing 20,500 MMCs at the secondary level, with classrooms featuring internet \\nconnectivity, one laptop and one multimedia. By 2019, 94.86 per cent  of secondary schools have access to \\nelectricity and the aim is to reach 100 per cent  by 2025. Similarly, 76.72 per cent  and 37.64  per cent  \\nsecondary schools have a computer and access to internet respectively for pedagogical purpose and the goa l \\nis to reach 100 per cent  by 2025.  \\nAlthough the numbers of students and institutions have increased rapidly in recent years, a worrying trend \\nis that the number of teachers has not grown at a similar rate. The number of students per institution has \\nincrea sed from 413 in 2012 to 5 00 in 201 9. With 12 teachers per institution between the period of 2012 and \\n2019, the number of students per teacher has increased from 34 to 44 in the period. Some projects have \\nhowever sought to improve the quality of teachers at  the secondary level, such as the Teaching Quality \\nImprovement in Secondary Education Project. Under this project, almost 220,000 secondary school \\nteachers (98 per cent  of total) were trained. The project has made a significant impact on improving the \\nquality of teaching in secondary education through organizational development and capacity building, \\nimproved teacher training facilities, strengthened in -service and pre -service teacher training, increased \\nequitable access, and improved community involvement.  \\nThe Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) are currently implementing a number of \\nprojects to improve the quality of education and access in the secondary level. The largest and most \\nprominent out of these projects is the Secondary Education  Sector Investment Program (2013 -2023) \\n(SESIP). The objective of the program is to achieve the goals envisaged under both the National Education \\nPolicy 2010 and Vision 2021, such as, enhancement of quality and relevance of secondary education; better \\nacces s and retention (leading to better completion rates) of students; and improvements to the governance, \\nmanagement, and administration structure of secondary education. Table 11.2 lists the goals and result areas \\nof SESIP.  \\nTable 11.2: SESIP Result Areas  \\nGoal s Specific Results  \\nEnhanced quality and relevance of \\nsecondary education  Improved quality and relevance of curriculum  \\nStrengthen teacher capacity  \\nImproved classroom assessment and national examinations  \\nEnhanced use of ICT for pedagogy  \\nImproved labour market relevance  \\nIncreased equitable access and retention \\nin secondary education  School infrastructure improvement  \\nFlexible learning pathways  \\nImproved access & retentions  \\nStrengthen governance, management \\nand administration  Strengthened decentral ized education management  \\nStrengthened education information management  \\nImproved teacher management  \\nEffective planning, management, coordination, and harmonization  \\nStrengthening monitoring, evaluation and reporting  \\nSource: SESIP, Directorate of Se condary and Higher Education, Government of Bangladesh    \\n \\n624 \\n Other DSHE Projects  \\nThe Secondary Education Quality and Access Enhancement Program (SEQAEP), which ran from 2008 to \\n2017, assist in improving the quality of secondary education and monitoring of learni ng outcomes \\nsystematically  and in increasing access and equity in education in project upazilas. Before the project, less \\nthan 30 per cent  of Grade 6 entrants were expected to complete Grade 10. The ratio has more than doubled \\nto 60 per cent  by the end of the project, making a significant dent in tackling the low internal efficiency of \\nsecondary education. Other project targets such as increasing female enrolment, lowering the percentage of \\npoor students, et cetera were all achieved. In addition, the govern ment is implementing the Transforming \\nSecondary Education for Results (TSER) program, to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in \\nsecondary education; improve retention and completion with special focus on the girl students and students \\nfrom poor ho useholds by providing financial assistances, stipends, and school grants; modernize the \\ncurriculum; and facilitate professional development and accountability of teachers. Since 2009, students \\nare distributed free textbooks every December for the upcoming academic year.  \\nMajor Challenges  \\nLow enrolment in secondary education is one of the major challenges in the education sector.  The gross \\nand net enrolments were 61 per cent  and 53 per cent  respectively in 201 9. Even bigger challenge is low \\nenrolment  in scie nce subjects in the higher secondary level. 20 years ago, just less than 50 per cent  students \\npassing SSC were science students. That number stands at only 28 per cent  in 201 9. Business students \\nrepresented 19 per cent  of SSC graduates in 201 9, compared to  only 7 per cent  in 1998. On the other hand, \\nonly 2 1 per cent  students who appeared for HSC in 201 9 were science students. This changing pattern of \\nenrolment is a cause of concern. The country will need a large pool of science graduates in the coming \\nyears  to achieve its development objectives. However, the current trends would indicate a move in an exact \\nopposite direction. There is a perception that science subjects are more difficult, which is probably true and \\nmay justify why students are unwilling to s tudy them. Lack of qualified science teachers is a major problem. \\nAccording to a recent study 36.8 per cent  teachers buy question papers from associations, 14.4 per cent  \\nfrom open market. About 37 per cent  teachers use guidebooks to teach in classrooms. Ab out 33 per cent  \\nmathematics teachers and 23 per cent  science teachers are found to use unauthorized guidebooks. In \\nessence, lack of qualified science teacher and the perceived difficulty as well as poor job market relevance \\nmay be contributing to the low s hare of science students in higher secondary education in Bangladesh. \\nSimilar to the case of primary education, enrolment shows slight progress without corresponding decline \\nin dropout. Gross enrolment for poor and non -poor are 24 per cent  and 76 per cent  respectively indicating \\nhigh inequity, which is another challenge.  \\n11.3.4  Progress in Madrasa Education  \\nDifferent education streams - Bangla medium, English medium and madrasa - is a debatable issue in the \\neducation sector of Bangladesh. Out of these, ma drasa stream faces most questions about the quality and \\nthe content of learning, as well as the labour  market relevance and employability of the graduates. The \\npresence of both a registered stream (Aliya) and a non -registered stream (Qawmi) exacerbates the  situation. \\nNot only in terms of learning -outcomes and employability, but the presence of different education -streams \\nis also widening the division between different strata of society.    \\n \\n625 \\n  In 2018, there were about 9,200 Aliya madrasa and 14,000 Qawmi madras a in Bangladesh, while 86 per  \\ncent of all madrasas are located in rural areas. They serve 3.1 and 3.8 per cent  of school -going children \\nrespectively. Aliyah  madrasa consists of five levels of education: Ebtedayee (primary equivalence; grade 1 \\nto 5), Dakhil  (grade 6 to SSC), Alim (equivalent to higher secondary), Fazil (equivalent to BA degrees), \\nand Kami l (equivalent to Master’s degree ). Dakhil and Alim have four streams: arts, muzabbid, science, \\nand business studies. Fazil and Kamil include specialization only in religious subjects such as Tafasir, \\nHadith, Arabic, and Fiqh. From 2010, Junior Dakhil Certificate (JDC) Examination has been introduced in \\nthe country, which is equivalent to grade 8 JSC examinations in Bangladesh.  \\nThe number of institutions has b een fairly stable over the last decade. In 2008 there were around 9,384 \\nAliya madrasas (less than 1,186 female -only), which had changed to 9,294 by 2018 (1,134 female -only, \\nonly 12 per cent  of the total). The share of different types of madrasa has also re mained constant over the \\nlast decade. Similarly, the number of teachers, students, and male -female ratio has remained fairly constant \\nover the years. There were around 107,000 registered madrasa teachers in 2011, rising to about 11 3,000 by \\n2019 (only about  16,000 female teachers; 7 per cent  of the total). Number of students in 2011 was around \\n2.20 million (1.17 million female), which had increased to 3.8 million ( 2.03 million female) by 201 9. There \\nare more girls than boys in madrasa. In 201 9, the total num ber of madrasa students were 2,4 91 thousand \\namong them 55.24 per cent  were girls. Over the years, female students increased from 1170 thousand in \\n2011 to 1370 thousand in 201 9. \\nIn 201 9, the average number of students per institution was 410 and average num ber of teachers per \\ninstitution was 12. Teacher student ratio was 1:2 1. However, there are variances in these ratios between \\ndifferent levels of education. Nearly 60 per cent  of all enrolments are for Dakhil level, the primary -\\nequivalent level. Kamil, the most advanced level, has the lowest enrolment rate. The opposite is true of \\nstudent -teacher, student -institution, and teacher -institution ratios, with the Dakhil level experiencing the \\nlowest ratios and the Kamil level experiencing the highest ratios. The trend in all these ratios since 2011 \\nhas been fairly constant, with some minor fluctuations between years.  \\nCurrently, there are around 6,300 Ebtedayee madrasas in the country. There are plans to bring the Ebtedayee \\nmadrasas under Monthly Pay Order (MPO). U nder this guideline, the Ebtedayee teachers will receive the \\nsame benefits as primary school teachers. Better pay is expected to attract higher -quality teachers to the \\nsector. At present, around 33,800 Ebtedayee teachers and employees are getting salaries and benefits. An \\ninitiative was taken at the end of 201 9 to provide ICT training to 19,200 madrasa teachers and special \\ncommunicative Arabic courses to 9,600 teachers. In addition, smart classrooms were to be established in \\n560 senior madrasas and around 1 20,000 students trained in basic ICT, computer training, and use of \\nInternet.  \\nQawmi madrasa  has been the most uncharted area in the education system of Bangladesh. Qawmi \\nmadrasas are not registered and most of them run on private donations. In terms of edu cation and \\ncurriculum, Qawmi madrasa is different from Aliya. There are six levels of education which takes on an \\naverage 7 -8 years to complete. In the primary level, children are taught to read Arabic, Urdu, and Persian \\nlanguage. Bengali, Mathematics, and  English are taught very briefly. After completing primary, students \\nare taught more about Quran, Hadith, Islamic Jurisprudence, and Islamic History. Unlike general stream \\nand Aliya students, science is rarely taught in.    \\n \\n626 \\n No major reform or review of curric ulum has been undertaken in the Madrasa stream during previous five -\\nyear plans. However, minor changes have been made. In 2019, the madrasa board decided to emphasize \\nspoken Arabic in its new national curriculum, to capitalize on skilled job opportunities in Middle Eastern \\ncountries. Middle East is already a popular destination for job -seekers from Bangladesh and this latest \\nprioritization offers potential career -paths  to many students. However, it is unlikely that spoken Arabic \\nalone can help madrasa -gradu ates find better jobs. Lessons on jihad and militancy were decided to be \\ndropped from 2021 academic year, and sections on inter -religious harmony added to the curriculum. \\nPerhaps most significantly, in 2017, the government announced that Dawra degree from Qawmi madrasas \\nwould be officially given the status of a masters’ equivalent degree to reduce the disparity faced in the job \\nmarket by madrasa students. Initially, no change to the Dawra curriculum has been mandated. However, \\nthere are plans to integrate t he existing six Qawmi madrasa education boards under one umbrella and task \\nthem with updating and modernizing the syllabi, preparing question papers and conducting exams, and \\naward certificates. Establishment of this board, coupled with formal recognition of the Dawra degree should \\nprovide a better and transparent career -path to 1.4 million students currently enrolled in the Qawmi system.  \\nMajor Challenges  \\nThe overall quality of Madrasa education and relevance to real world job markets is very limited. Exper ts \\nbelieve that there has to be greater focus on science, technical, and other employable skills education in this \\nsystem. Moreover, the quality of teachers, availability of facilities (books, supplies, ICT, etc.) remains an \\nissue. Research has shown that there is large gap in learning -outcomes between general school students and \\nmadrasa students and girls have lower test scores compared with boys in this stream. Other important \\nproblem is that the Qawmi stream, which is more popular than the Aliya stream, is run independently, \\nwithout any input from the government. This raises questions about timely review and updating of their \\ncurriculum, and teaching methodology. Fund management and transparency is also an issue, especially with \\nthe Qawmi stream, as they run mostly on private -donations and do not disclose their accounting books.  \\nA self -selection bias prevails in madrasa enrolment, with a disproportionate number of poor and rural \\nfamilies sending their children to madrasas in lieu of general schools. Since the learning -outcomes and \\nemployability of madrasa -graduates is much lower compared to graduates from the general -stream, the \\nformer gets potentially lower return from education. Therefore, the presence of the madrasa -stream, with \\nits current structure of pedagogy could perpetuate a poverty -cycle. The advent of the fourth industrial \\nrevolution will only exacerbate this situation.  \\nMoreover, the continued existence of a madrasa -stream - in its present format - has been questioned and \\nthere have been calls for  reforms. In addition to perpetuating a vicious poverty -cycle among the poorest \\nfamilies sending their children to school, the structural and pedagogical differences between the general \\nand madrasa -stream of education is creating/maintaining artificial str ata in society, in terms of both income \\nand culture. Under the 7FYP, one of the goals for secondary education was to minimize multiplicity in \\neducation by modernizing madrasa education and to reduce the gap in resources and facilities in secondary \\neducatio n between general education and madrasa education. Progress in this front has been less \\nsatisfactory .   \\n \\n627 \\n 11.3.5  Progress in Higher Education  \\nHigher education plays a critical role in developing skilled human resources of a country. Moreover, it \\nplays a centra l role in the quality improvement of both primary and secondary education outcomes. If there \\nis a learning deficiency in the pre -tertiary level, the tertiary level itself cannot produce desired outcomes. \\nImportantly quality tertiary education produces qual ity teachers which can substantially improve the quality \\nof primary and secondary education. Therefore, primary, secondary and tertiary education will need \\nsimultaneous focus as their development is inter -linked. Furthermore, standing on the verge of the f ourth \\nindustrial revolution, the need for Bangladesh to focus on its tertiary education is now more important than \\never. Bangladesh has a structured system of tertiary education. The tertiary education providing institutions \\ncan broadly be divided into thr ee categories: universities, tertiary colleges under general education system, \\nand the polytechnics under the TVET system.  \\nBangladesh witnessed a major growth of the tertiary educational institutions during 200 9-2018. The total \\nnumber of universities in t he country has increased from 82 in 2008 to 145 in 2018. The subset of private \\nuniversities more than doubled during the same period, increasing from 51 to 103. This has also translated \\ninto a large increase, more than double, in the number of university s tudents from 0.4 million in 2009 to 1 \\nmillion in 2018. Rate of increase in number of students is higher than the rate of increase of universities, \\nindicating that the rise in students is not only an outcome of greater opportunities, but also of greater dem and \\nfor higher education. The number of teachers per institution has increased from 245 in 2008 to 345 in 2018. \\nIn 2009 , there were 21 students per teacher in the public universities, whereas in 2018 the number increased \\nto 49. The number of tertiary colle ges increased during this period as this master’s degree providing \\ncolleges. This progress has been greatly facilitated by the government’s policy to allow the private supply \\nof tertiary education, as seen by the rise in number of private universities over  the concerned period. In \\norder to keep up this positive trend in the sector, the government has adopted the Strategic Plan for Higher \\nEducation in Bangladesh: 2017 - 2031.  \\nNotwithstanding this progress, the total coverage of tertiary education is still ver y limited.  Only 12.1 per \\ncent people of Bangladesh have higher education. This rate is 8.7 per cent  for females and 15.5 per cent  for \\nmales. Geographically, 19.9 per cent  people in urban areas and 8.8 per cent  people in rural areas have higher \\neducation. I n addition, female students account for only 26 per cent  of total students in public and private \\nuniversities. Therefore, wide gaps exist across the gender and socio -economic groups.  \\n Professional institutions provide education related to a particular pro fession, such as engineering \\nuniversities, medical colleges, dental colleges, law colleges, art colleges, etc. The number of professional \\ninstitutes increased from 242 in 2009 to 425 in 2018. Number of medical colleges increased from 48 (18 \\npublic, 30 priv ate) in 2010 to 111 (37 public, 74 private) in 2018. Dental colleges increased from 11 (1 \\npublic and 10 private) to 35 (9 public, 26 private) during the 2010 -2018 period. Only three Textile \\nTechnology Colleges were established during this period (increase from 8 to 11). In case of Leather \\nTechnology Colleges, the number remained unchanged at one. For all the public institutes the number of \\nstudents per teacher has decreased significantly from 12 to 6 during this period. But for the private institutes \\nwe wit ness an increase from 17 to 19 during this period.  \\n   \\n \\n628 \\n The 7FYP targeted to minimize the gap in enrolment between male and female, poor and non -poor, and the \\nurban and rural population. To bring the curriculum of higher education on par with the demands and \\nexpectations of 21st century, the government has undertaken various steps. In 2017, the Accreditation \\nCouncil Bill was passed in the parliament that stipulates an independent council to evaluate programmes  of \\nboth public and private universities. The bill a llows extensive monitoring of academic activities at the \\nuniversities. The Higher Education Quality Enhancement Project (HEQEP), which was implemented with \\nthe help of the World Bank through the University Grants Commission, aims to improve the quality, an d \\nrelevance, on higher education institutions in Bangladesh by i) encouraging innovation within universities, \\nii) demanding greater accountability from the university authorities, and iii) Instituting capacity \\ndevelopment of higher education institutions a nd the sector as a whole. The project was implemented \\nbetween 2009 and 2018 and focused on industry -university collaborative research including four other \\nmajor points: promoting academic innovation in teaching, learning and research; institutional capacit y \\nbuilding at the University Grants Commission (UGC) and universities; connectivity capacity building for \\nresearch centres  and universities and project management.  \\nThe Ministry of Education has also undertaken steps to further strengthen and empower UGC t o improve \\nthe quality and scope of higher education and make it internationally competitive through appropriate \\ncurriculum development, support for Science and Technology (S&T), encouragement of research, and using \\nhigh level training to prepare and equip the next generation to successfully meet the challenges of \\nglobalization and contribute to Bangladesh\\'s socioeconomic development.   \\nMajor Challenges  \\nThe key challenges in higher education are quality of education and low enrolment as well as labour market \\nrelevance. Graduates from the STEM  background are imperative for the current level of development of \\nthe country, particularly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. Gender parity is also one of the \\nmajor challenges; roughly 45 per cent  (26 per cent ) students in the tertiary sector (universities) are female. \\nNet enrolment is also low, at less than 20 per cent . \\nAlthough there has been an increase in the enrolment in tertiary education in recent years, a large portion \\nof this increase accounts fo r increase in enrolment in humanities and social science discipline. Once all the \\ntertiary institutions are included,  STEM -enrolment as a share of higher education enrolment stands at only \\n21 per cent . The quality and job -readiness of the graduates is less than par . Tracer studies on university and \\ncollege graduates indicate lack of marketable skills and job -readiness on the part of students. A recent study \\non the graduates from universities under the University Grants Commission showed 38.6 per cent  \\nunempl oyment among the graduates, and that 34 per cent  of the graduates get a job within 2 to 3 years of \\ntheir graduation. For the labour  market relevance, another challenge is the absence of industry -academia \\ncollaboration. This leads to a lack of coordination between what is being taught and what is expected at \\nworkplaces. Increasing enrolment (and completion) without paying attention to industry linkage will merely \\ncreate a pool of highly educated but potentially unemployable graduates, as studies have shown.  \\n   \\n \\n629 \\n 11.3.6  Progress with Non -Formal Education  \\nLiteracy is a basic tool for all individuals, regardless of age, should possess. It is an effective instrument of \\nsocial change that empowers individuals with the essential skills of numeracy, communication and pr oblem \\nsolving. One of the main focuses of the PP2021 strategy is to achieve Education for All (EFA). An important \\ncomponent of the government’s EFA is the coverage of non -formal education (NFE). Non-Formal \\nEducation (NFE) especially literacy and Literacy i s a basic tool for all individuals, regardless of age, should \\npossess. It is an effective instrument of social change that empowers individuals with the essential skills of \\nnumeracy, communication and problem solving. Non-Formal Education (NFE) especially literacy and \\ncontinuing education for adults and youths including life skills & livelihood skills development, is \\nconsidered as the process of empowerment that contributes to human resource development and poverty \\nreduction.  \\nThe Government has been implem enting Literacy/NFE programmes in various forms since its \\nIndependence in 1971. The commitment to battling adult illiteracy prompted the Government to launch a \\nmajor non formal education Programme in the 1990s, focusing on basic literacy. The government ha s \\nadopted NFE Policy in 2006 aimed at reducing the number of illiterates, offering need -based continuing \\neducation, promotion of equivalency between formal and non -formal education, ensuring community \\nownership and sustainability of NFE programmes.  \\nBanglad esh has continued to make progress in improving adult literacy rates, growing from 58.6 per cent  \\nin 2010 to 75.0 per cent  in 201 9.  Figure 11.2 shows the progress made in addressing adult illiteracy. There \\nhas been a slow but steady progress with increasin g the adult literacy rates for both male and female.  The \\ngap between male and female literacy rates has also been reduced.  The progress was maintained under the \\nSixth and Seventh Plans.   \\nFigure 11.2: Progress with Adult Literacy (%)  \\n \\n Source: Banglades h Bureau of Statistics  Yearbook, Various Years  \\nA Non - Formal Education Act (NFEA) was adopted in 2014 to provide a legal framework for fulfilling the \\nobligation regarding adult and non -formal education.  0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0\\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Both Male Female  \\n \\n630 \\n Since 2014, the BoNFE have been implementing the Bas ic Literacy Project (64 Districts), with an aim of \\nproviding transformative basic literacy skills to 4.5 million between the age of 15 and 45. A total of 39,331 \\ncontinuing education centres  have been opened nationwide, housed with 78,621 teachers (equal nu mber of \\nmale and female students and teachers), and 1,967 supervisors. So far, around 2.4 million students have \\npassed through the centres . \\nEmerging issues and challenges:  Notwithstanding this progress, there is still a substantial unfinished \\nagenda. Some 29 per cent  adult female and 23 per cent  adult male remain illiterate. There is a substantial \\nrural-urban gap, with the average rural literacy rate at only 66 per cent .  Rural adult women are particularly \\ndeprived of basic literacy; some 37 per cent  of wom en are illiterate.  Additionally, there are concerns about \\nthe limited scope of the literacy achieved, especially in terms of numerical skills and there is no link to \\nlifetime learning concept adopted under the SDG. At the institutional level, the BoNFE ha s been an \\nimportant institutional change that is playing an important role in furthering the cause of NFE.  However, \\nthe Bureau is not fully equipped to operationalize the broad vision of the NFE policy framework. The \\ncapacity of BoNFE needs substantial up grading to move to the goal of lifelong learning.   Coordination, \\naccountability, transparency, people’s participation and monitoring mechanism are essential. Attention \\nmust be given to the multifaceted and multi -layered governance to reduce the above -menti oned challenges \\nin different levels of education.  \\n11.4 PROGRESS WITH SKILLS DEVELOPMENT  \\nApplication of new technology change production process that make some workers redundant in the short \\nrun and, creates ‘technological unemployment’. An updated TVET sector w ith proper industry linkage can \\nhelp the displaced workers learn the necessary skills. More importantly, TVET provides an alternate option \\nto those individuals who may not be comfortable in a traditional education institution or could not continue \\nschool/c ollege due to family or other reasons. The perspective plan (2010 -2021) and the 7th Five Year Plan \\nemphasizes the role of expansion and modernization of TVET for building a skilled workforce. One sub -\\ngoal under SDG -4 is about ensuring equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, \\nvocational and tertiary education, including university. Studies have shown that the return from TVET \\neducation is higher than from regular schooling for a below average student. For Bangladesh’s transitio n \\ntowards an upper -middle income country, increased investment in TVET will be crucial. Global \\nexperiences suggest that TVET sector expands with level of development of a country. The academic \\nstreams will not be able to absorb all the children (who are ov er one -third of the population currently) and \\nimportantly it will not be able to provide every necessary skill that will be demanded in the future.  In \\nBangladesh, formal TVET consists of SSC, HSC, and Diploma courses, HSC (vocational), SSC \\n(vocational), a nd HSC (BM). The courses are offered by Engineering Colleges, Polytechnic Institutes, \\nTechnical School and Colleges (TSCs), Technical Teachers’ Training College (TTTC), Vocational Teachers’ \\nTraining Institute (VTTI), Business Management Colleges and other technical and vocational institutes.  \\nBangladesh has gradually transformed from an agriculture -based to an industrial and service - based \\neconomy. Low and less skilled workforce with basic education served this transition well so far. But to \\nachieve upper mi ddle income status by 2031 and particularly to take advantage from the fourth industrial \\nrevolution, up -gradation of both hard skills (job specific skills such as project management, cloud \\ncomputing, computer technology, data analysis, marketing etc.) as w ell as soft skills (abilities such as \\ncommunication skill, problem solving, work ethics, interpersonal skills, team management, creativity, time   \\n \\n631 \\n management, adaptability etc.) will become crucial. Unfortunately, the existing education system including \\nTVET  gives relatively less emphasis on developing these particular skills. Hence the skill levels and \\nproductivity of the workers have not increased sufficiently. Private sector consistently identifies lack of \\nrelevant skills they require.  \\nAccording to LFS 20 16-17, Bangladesh has a working -age youth population (between the age of 15 and \\n29) of 41.25 million. Among various age groups of the labour  force, unemployment among the youth is the \\nhighest. The unemployment rate of young people in the country is 10.7 per cent  and this accounts for 79.6 \\nper cent  weight in total unemployment. Moreover, almost 30 per cent  of the youth population was not in \\nNEET (not in employment, education or training) in 2017. Among this group, 97.8 per cent  of male and \\n98.7 per cent  of female in age group 15+ did not have any access to training. Those who got training were \\nmostly short courses of two weeks duration. According to Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training \\n(BMET), there were 13 million Bangladeshis working abroad at the be ginning of 2020, most of whom are \\nless or semi -skilled. A more skilled pool of migrant workers from Bangladesh would readily translate into \\nhigher remittance for the country.  \\nThe enrolment rate in TVET increased from 1 per cent  in 2009 to 16 per cent  in 2018. The number of TVET \\ninstitutions more than doubled between 2008 and 2018 (Figure 11.3). Public institution contributed 335 and \\n866 institutions out of these; the rest were private. During the same period, the number of students increased \\nfrom around 46 4,000 in 2008 to 1,067,000 million in 2018 (Figure 11.4). For public institutions, this rise \\nwas 123,000 to 329,000. The rest were from private institutions. The ratio between students and teacher \\nslightly decreased, from 22:1 to 21:1. However, NEP 2010 su ggests that this ratio should be around 12:1.  \\nFigure 11.3: No. of TVET Institutions  Figure 11.4: No. of TVET Students (‘000s)  \\n  \\n  Source: BANBIES  2019  \\nA major problem in the TVET sector is low -female participation. As discussed already, there has been  a \\nrapid rise in the absolute size of enrolment in TVET in the last decade. This is true for both male and female \\nenrolment. However, growth rate in female enrolment has been on par with the growth rate in male \\nenrolment. As a result, the gender -mix ratio has stagnated at around 25 per cent  female students in the last \\n10 years (Figure 11.5). This represents a gender -imbalance that remains to be addressed. Achieving SDG \\ntarget 4.3 of gender equality will require ensuring equal access for all women and men to  TVET and in \\nUniversity by 2030.  \\n01000200030004000500060007000\\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Public Private\\n0100200300400500600700800\\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Public Private  \\n \\n632 \\n Figure 11.5: TVET Enrolment  by Gender  \\n \\nSource: BANBIES  2019  \\nThe Government has implemented the National Education Policy (2010) and National Skills Development \\nPolicy (2011) to improve the TVET system and address the issu es of the sector. To address the skill -gap, \\nthe Government initiated the TVET Reform Project of 2008 -15, the National Skills Development Project \\n2011 (NSDP 2011) and the Skills for Training for Employment Program (STEP).  The government has also \\nsubstantia lly stepped up the institutional arrangement for skills development (Table 11.3). These \\ninstitutional reforms are expected to bring about a major transformation in the delivery of skills for \\nBangladesh.  \\nIn addition, under the NSDP, the National Technical a nd Vocational Qualifications Framework (NTVQF) \\nhas been designed to standardize the technical and vocational qualifications. The framework is \\ncomprehensive and is coherent with international top practices. ADB is helping the government to \\nimplement the NSD P2011 with a major skills enhancement program called the Skills for Employment \\nInvestment Project (SEIP) which has partnered with a number of industry associations such as BASIS, \\nBTMA, BGMEA, AEOSIB and others to impart vocational training with globally re cognized skills \\ncertifications where appropriate. The Technical and Madrasa Division (TMED) has also been created in the \\nMinistry of Education to introduce TVET into the madrasa stream.  \\nThese policy and institutional reforms and investment programmes  have started yielding important benefits \\nin terms of availability of skills.  A particularly useful instrument is the SEIP that has shown considerable \\npromise in terms of delivering results (Table Box 11. 1).

Yet, the skills gaps are \\nlarge and will require concerted efforts during the 8FYP to close the gap.

By bringing workers, \\nemployers, and government together, ISCs improve the skills development system. \\nThere are 12 ISCs in Bangladesh. Functions of the ISCs are as follows:  \\na) Introducing skills training institutions to the latest employment and technology \\ntrends. b) Improving social dialogues to encourage public -private -donor partnerships. \\nc) Increasing th e efficacy of the skills data system to strengthen industry\\'s role in data \\ncollection and ensuring the demand side data is correct.  \\nNational Skill s \\nDevelopment \\nAuthority (NSD A) Currently multiple institutions are providing the same skills -training while m uch \\nneeded niche skills are being provided by no, or not enough, institutions. To deal with \\nthese challenges National Skill s Development Authority (NSD A) has been established. \\nNSD A is one of the major players in improving the coordination of skill developm ent \\nacross Bangladesh. NSD A is working on ensuring the efficacy of the public \\ninstitutions in using resources and implementing arrangements to facilitate private \\ntraining providers to access public facilities, to enhance the scope of skills training.  \\nComp etency Based \\nTraining and \\nAssessment (CBT&A)  This training material  is designed to develop a system to deliver demand -driven \\ntraining, primarily through encouraging private sector industry partnership with \\ntraining institutions. Therefore, industry is expe cted to increase its engagement and \\nsupport to training institutions, so that programmes  and graduates are more likely to \\nmeet the needs of employers and their staff.  \\n \\nBox 11. 1: Performance of SEIP  \\nTranche 1 outcome : Increased employment in priority \\nsectors and skills for males and females.

Accordingly, the \\ngovernment has adopted various poli cies to improve the equity of education during the 6FYP and the 7FYP. \\nThese include endorsing the education for all (EFA) policy, adopting universal education up to grade 8, \\nproviding stipends to girls and the needy, ensuring better access to education fac ilities at all Thana levels \\nand in remote areas, and spreading the reach of non -formal education.  These policies had secured \\nconsiderable success reflected in near universal primary education, substantial increase in secondary \\neducation enrolment rates, e limination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education and the sharp \\nincrease in male and female literacy rates.  Nevertheless, the Government recognizes this is an unfinished \\nagenda.  \\nIn the matter of school attendance, data from 2016 -17 HIES an d 2010 HIES show that despite progress \\nthere is still considerable gap in school attendance by poor at all school going age group, from primary (6 -\\n11 years) to secondary (12 -18 years) and higher secondary and tertiary education (19 -24 years).  The per \\ncent of poor children out of school increases progressively by levels of education, with the largest gap at \\nthe higher secondary and tertiary level (Table 11.4).  The per cent  of school attendance for the poor has \\nincreased at all levels of education between 2 010 and 2016, which is good news.  However, the gap between \\nthe rich and poor remains stubbornly large.  \\nTable 11.4: School Attendance of Children by Poverty Status, 2010 -2016  \\nYear  Poverty status  Children Not Attending School  \\nChildren aged 6 -11 years  Children aged \\n12-18 years  Youth Aged \\n19-24 years  \\n \\n \\n2010  Poor  24.7 38.8 60.9 \\nNon-poor 12.0 24.5 33.3 \\nTotal  16.2 35.2 48.8 \\nPoor – Non-Poor Ratio  2.1 1.6 1.8 \\n \\n \\n2016  Poor  10.8 28.5 49.2 \\nNon-poor 5.1 19.1 28.7 \\nTotal  7.9 22.6 31.3 \\nPoor – Non-Poor Rati o 2.1 1.5 1.7 \\nSource: GED estimates based on HIES 2010 and 2016.  \\nRegarding the quality of education, reading and numeracy skills are taken into consideration for children \\naged 7 -14 years as reported in MICS 2019. We have taken two indicators into consider ation here to assess \\nthe reading skills and three indicators for numeracy skills. For reading, the indicators include ‘not being \\nable to correctly read 90 per cent of words in a story’ and ‘not being able to demonstrate foundational \\nreading skills’. For nu meracy, the indicators are ‘not being able to read numbers’, ‘not being able to \\ndiscriminate numbers’ and ‘not being able to recognize and complete patterns. Results in these respects are \\nnot encouraging. More than one -third of children couldn’t correctly read words in a story and more than \\nhalf of the children failed to demonstrate foundational reading skills. For numeracy, once again, more than \\none-third of the children couldn’t successfully complete the tasks of number reading and number \\ndiscrimination, and about two -third couldn’t complete the task of pattern recognition (Table 11.5). These \\nclearly indicate that the average competence level of the children is rather poor, and hence the quality of \\neducation is really a matter of concern.    \\n \\n635 \\n Alongside quality  concerns at the aggregate level, there are also inequalities amongst the children of the \\npoorest and richest families in the quality of education that they receive. As the data shows, children from \\nthe poorest families are more than 2 times more likely no t to receive quality education (in respect of simple \\nreading and numeracy tests) than that of the children from the richest families (Table 1.13). For relatively \\na bit more complicated tests (i.e., foundational skills for reading and pattern recognition an d completion in \\nnumeracy), there still exist disparities (poorest children are about 1.5 times more likely not to complete the \\ntasks compared to the richest children), but the magnitude is lower than the simple tests.  \\nTable 11.5: Quality of Education for Children Aged 6 -14 Years in Bangladesh, 2018  \\nYear  Wealth Quintile and \\nRatio of the Poorest \\nQuintile over the \\nRichest  Reading Skills Numeracy Skills**: Percentage of children \\nwho couldn’t successfully complete tasks \\nof \\nPercentage who \\ncouldn’t \\ncorrectly r ead \\n90% of words \\nin a story  Percentage \\nwho couldn’t \\ndemonstrate \\nfoundational \\nreading skills  Number \\nreading  Number \\ndiscriminat\\nion Pattern \\nrecognition \\nand \\ncompletion  \\n2018  Lowest  52.3 64.6 52.3 49.5 73.3 \\nSecond  43.0 56.1 42.1 38.8 67.3 \\nMiddle  35.9 49.4 36.6 33.4 64.0 \\nFourth  32.0 45.5 32.3 28.8 60.6 \\nHighest  23.4 36.4 23.8 18.9 52.9 \\nTotal  38.1 51.2 38.2 34.7 64.2 \\n Poorest -Richest Ratio  2.2 1.8 2.2 2.6 1.4 \\nSource: MICS 2019  \\nAn important aspect of equity in schools is access to water, sanitation and hygiene  (WASH) facilities at \\neducational institutions, which are a prerequisite for improving the learning environment and for enhancing \\ngirls’ attendance. Significant progress was made in the WASH front at schools in Bangladesh with 92% of \\nschools having i mproved water coverage in 2019. —. All schools have improved sanitation facilities, \\nalthough 65% of schools have gender -segregated toilets, and when considering the availability of soap and \\nwater, the figure drops down to 39%. On average, there is one funct ional, improved, unlocked toilet for \\nevery 113 students.  \\nA major development regarding WASH in schools is its increasing acknowledgement by the government. \\nUsing findings from the National Hygiene Baseline Survey 2014, the Ministry of Education issued a \\ncircular in June 2015 instructing relevant authorities to improve the WASH scenario in schools, including \\ngender -friendly sanitation and MHM. The ministry issued another circular in January 2019 on ensuring an \\nenabling learning environment in schools, which  entailed the provision of separate WASH blocks for male \\nand female students. These actions underline government’s full committed to close or significantly narrow \\nthe remaining gaps through proper implementation of WASH in schools’ program.  \\n11.6 8th FIVE YEAR P LAN TARGET FOR EDUCATION AND TVET  \\nTables 11.6 and 11.7 summarize the main education sector targets to be achieved under the 8FYP. These \\ntargets are based on SDGs as well as the targets for PP2041. Specifically, the targets as shown are \\ncommensurate with ac hieving the following SDG goals: SDG4 - quality education; SDG5 -gender equality; \\nSDG10 - reduction in income inequality. Importantly, the PP2041 target to eradicate extreme poverty and   \\n \\n636 \\n reduce moderate poverty will be helped by achieving these targets. Other PP2041 targets, such as \\nindustrialization and developments of the service sector will be assisted by progress made in the TVET and \\nhigher education sectors.  \\nTable 11.6: 8FYP  Targets for Education and TVET in Bangladesh  \\nIndicators  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025 SDG Goal  \\n Primary Education1 \\nGross Enrolment Rate (%)  110 109 107 106 105 104 4, 5 & 10  \\nNet Enrolment Rate (%)  99 99 100 100 100 100 4, 5 & 10  \\nRepetition Rate (%)  6 6 6 6 5 5 4 \\nDropout Rate (%)  15 14 12 10 10 9 4 & 10  \\nSurvival Rate (%)  85 86 88 88 88 91 4 & 10  \\nTeacher -student ratio  1:31 1:30 1:29 1:29 1:30 1:30 4 \\nStudent per institutions  142 139 138 140 142 140 4 \\nTeacher per institutions  5 5 5 5 5 5 4 \\nTeacher to student (GPS)  1:34 1:33 1:31 1:30 1:29 1:28 4 \\nStudent/institutions (GPS)  240 238 237 238 240 239 4 \\nTeacher/institutions (GPS)  7 7 8 8 8 9 4 \\n Secondary Education2 \\nGross Enrolment Rate (%)  64 66 67 69 70 72 4, 5 & 10  \\nNet Enrolment Rate (%)  56 58 59 61 62 64 4, 5 & 10  \\nTeacher -student ratio  1:40 1:38 1:36 1:34 1:32 1:30 4 \\nStudent per  institutions  498 502 502 502 500 502 4 \\nTeacher per institutions  12 13 14 15 16 17 4 \\n Madrasa Education3 \\nTeacher -student ratio  1:25 1:26 1:26 1:27 1:28 1:30 4 \\nStudent per institutions  263 264 264 264 264 264 4 \\nTeacher per institutions  18 18 18 18 18 18 4 \\nScience Enrolment  17% 20% 23% 28% 32% 35% 4 \\n TVET 4 \\nTeacher -student ratio  1:18 1:16 1:15 1:14 1:13 1:12 4 \\nStudent per institutions  171 160 165 161 156 156 4 \\nTeacher per institutions  10 10 11 12 12 13 4 \\n University Education5 \\nTeacher -student rat io 1:28 1:27 1:26 1:23 1:20 1:17 4 \\nStudent per institutions  6,779  6,704  6,778  6,864  6,819  6,799  4 \\nTeacher per institutions  242 248 261 298 341 400 4 \\nNote : 1PEDP Targets; 2SESIP Targets; 3Standard Secondary Rate; 4NEP 2010 Targets; 5Top 100 Universities in the world  \\nSDG Goal 4: Quality Education - Ensure  inclusive  and equitab le quality education and promote  lifelong learning  opportunities \\nfor all.

Universal access, enrolment \\nand gender parity at the primary and secondary level has not ensured quality education. The quality issue \\nremains a great concern for all the streams of education including TVET. The quality issues include low \\nteacher to student ratio, in terms of learning outcomes, low cognitive skills, variation among schools, \\nteachers’ pay scale and students tuition fees, a bsenteeism of both teachers and students, limited or non -\\nexistent incentive for better performance, and low levels of accountability in  the usage of funds . At the \\nhigher levels, participation is low across the board, but especially low for poor people and females. \\nMoreover, the share of science graduates is considerably lower than that of humanities, social sciences, \\nbusiness, etc. This creates a substantial gap between employers’ demand and graduate skills. An estimated \\n54 per cent of South Asian youth lea ve school without the necessary skills to get a decent job in the next \\ndecade.13 Only 26 per cent  of secondary -age children in the region were on track in 2019 to complete school \\nand learn the basic skills needed for employment - rising to just 46 per cent  by the year 2030. The figure \\nwas 26 per cent  for Bangladesh in 2019, rising to only 55 per cent  by 2030.  \\nConsequently, a large number of graduates remain unemployed or under -employed. The low -quality \\nteachers, curriculum, and pedagogy make science and math ematics subjects ‘difficult’ for the students, \\ncreating low -quality graduates. The high unemployment of educated youth suggests that the education and \\ntraining sector strategies need to be better linked to job creation.  \\nTo achieve UMIC status by 2031, the 8FYP will align country’s human capital development strategy with \\nthe overall economic development strategy. A holistic approach and a regulatory framework for skill \\ndevelopment will be adopted, where all tiers of education and vocational training will be interlinked. All \\neducation and skill related policies will complement each other to achieve the broader goal of creating a \\nknowledge and skill -based society. In addition, the skill development policy will specify how to incentivize \\nthe training of the work ers for the employers since learning or skill acquisition occurs most at the industry \\nlevel through on -the-job training. Furthermore, the importance of soft skill will be integrated and strategic \\nguidelines will be prepared on how to educate these skills. This training will start from the pre -primary \\nlevel of education and will be an integral part  of the curriculum.  \\n                                                     \\n13  UNICEF & Global Business Coalition for Education (2019). 2030 Skills Scorecard, South Asia Edition .   \\n \\n638 \\n Table 11.8 Children in South Asia on Track to Complete Secondary School and Learn Basic Skills \\nby 2030  \\nCountry  2019  2030 Projection  \\nBangladesh  26 55 \\nBhutan  47 81 \\nIndia  19 47 \\nMaldives  16 46 \\nNepal  13 46 \\nPakistan  18 40 \\nSri Lanka  61 68 \\nSource: UNICEF and GBC -Education, 2019  \\n11.7.1 Addressing Cross-Cutting Issues in Education and Training  \\nThe main strategies and policies to achieve the goals and targets of the 8FYP education sector development \\nare highlighted in Tables 11.5 and 11.6 which comprise of several cross -cutting strategies and policies that \\nencompass the entire education sector as well as sub -sector -specific strategies and policies a s well as several \\ncross -cutting strategies and policies that encompass the entire education sector. The cross -cutting strategies \\nand policies include:  \\nSharply increase public education expenditure, as a percentage of GDP:  A major constraint that has \\nlimite d the progress with education and training is the scarcity of public resources.  Despite efforts, public \\neducation spending continues to be low , reaching a maximum 2.47  per cent  in 2017, but falling again in the \\nsubsequent years to around 2 per cent  of GDP .  For most developed countries, education expenditure as a \\npercentage of GDP tends to be over 5 per cent . For India, the latest figure is 4.6 per cent . The PP2041 set a \\ntarget of increasing public spending in education to 4 per cent  of GDP by FY2031 and 5  per cent  of GDP \\nby FY2041. In line with those targets, public spending is targeted to reach 3.5% of GDP by FY2025.  \\nInvolving private sector in education investment and curriculum development:  Private sector provision \\nof education was duly encouraged in t he 6FYP and in the 7FYP, particularly in higher education. This has \\npaid rich dividends as indicated by the rapid growth in the supply of private education especially at the \\nhigher secondary and tertiary level. The 8FYP will continue with this policy. Priv ate sectors are the largest \\nemployer of the graduates. Hence it is important to involve them in the curriculum development process. \\nThe 8FYP will seek inputs from private businesses in curriculum development and develop public -private \\npartnerships in the d evelopment and delivery of skills for employment programmes  \\nStrengthen parent consultation process: It is also very important to inform citizens about the demands \\nfor specific skills in the market. It is not the degree or a certificate but the competence a nd proficiency in \\nperforming specific tasks that are mostly important.  Demand side interventions can work on choosing the \\nright stream of education and vocational training. The  return from switching to vocational training for a \\nbelow average student can b e higher than in persisting with general education. But to take advantage of this \\noutcome, students (and their parents) need to be aware of the skills demands. Accordingly, the 8FYP will \\nseek to involve parents in education development.  \\n   \\n \\n639 \\n Strengthen the rel evance of education to skills and employment:  The lack of adequate student learning \\noutcomes remains one of the major concerns for Bangladesh. One potential low -cost intervention can be \\nearly -childhood development through pre -primary education. Studies hav e showed that early childhood \\ninterventions can have substantial and lasting impact on learning and earning outcomes later in life. \\nEvidence shows  that e xposure to early childhood learning interventions lead to better school readiness \\nthrough enhanced cogn itive, numerical, and literacy skills. Providing remedial assistance to struggling \\nstudents is also important. Additional teaching can be provided to those students willing to stay after school \\nto improve their learning . Studies have shown that remedial as sistance keeps students in school longer and \\nlowers dropout rate. The 8FYP will undertake necessary reforms to strengthen the relevance of the \\neducation system.  \\nStrengthen teacher quality and skills:   Education outcomes are only as good as the quality of c urriculum \\nand the quality of teachers. Future curriculum reviews will focus towards developing competency, not \\ncontent -learning. Teachers will be trained and made familiar with  this approach, and be incentivized \\nsufficiently in performing their jobs. South  Korean students, for example, perform better than most of the \\ndeveloped world because of a shift away from the traditional means of learning towards critical thinking \\nand problem -solving skills. South Korea also placed emphasis on teacher -training, pay, a nd other \\nincentives. A similar strategy will be undertaken for Bangladesh under the 8FYP.  \\nDecentralize primary and secondary education to the district level:  Presently  the delivery of primary \\nand secondary education is highly  centralized. For a nationwide student population of some 40 million, a \\nmillion teachers, and 200,000 institutions, the structure of education governance regarding decision -making \\nand management is concentrated in the capital city which will be reformed under the 8FYP. Education \\nresourc e mobilization, budget making, management and service delivery will be strengthened by \\ndecentralization involving Upazila and district based -planning and management of primary and secondary \\nschool education. A permanent statutory National Education Commiss ion, anticipated in Education Policy \\n2010, will be used as a mechanism for guiding, exercising oversight and assessing progress and impact of \\neducation reforms.  \\nStrengthen research on education and skills improvements:  There  is a dearth of quality data tha t can be \\nused to track skills mismatch in different sectors. This is essential to develop effective education and skills \\npolicies. For this BBS will regularly conduct separate surveys on skills and create a separate database. Also, \\nnew indicators to be dev eloped that measures the quality -aspect of education and training. This latter will \\nmake it easier to align education objectives with industry -demands and the industry development policies.  \\n11.7.2  Strategies for Pre -Primary and Early Childhood Education  \\nImplementation of pre -primary and early childhood education is still in the early inception stage in \\nBangladesh. The 8FYP will place strong emphasis on the development of pre -primary and early childhood \\neducation drawing on the Bangladesh and relevant globa l experiences.  \\n\\uf0b7 A tool to reduce disparity : Early childhood interventions are the first and foremost tools to narrow \\nthe size of inequality in a country. By targeting the disadvantaged group, especially first -time \\nlearners, and helping them not fall behind other privileged students, earnings and wealth inequality   \\n \\n640 \\n will be reduced in the country, which is the 10th SDG. So, the 8FYP will expand the pre -primary \\neducation on the basis of equity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop appropriate curriculum and train teachers for pre -primary : Appropriate curriculum \\ndesign and training of teachers is vital at this stage. The very aim of pre -primary education is to \\nprovide foundation to the cognitive skills of a student and make him or her ready for lifelong \\nlearning, creative problem solving, and  greater adaptability to change. However, without the proper \\nenvironment, pre -primary education may fail to impart these life -skills. A successful pre -primary \\nprogram in Bangladesh means that the teachers have been trained to undertake pre -primary \\npedagogy , which includes understanding of child psychology, and a carefully designed play -based \\ncurriculum has been developed. Therefore, under the 8FYP, a new group of teachers specializing \\nin early childhood learning will be trained to keep up with the expanding  coverage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen public -private partnership : More students are receiving pre -primary education via \\nNGOs and other private organizations than through public institutions. The 8FYP will continue \\nencouraging these institutions to upscale and involve more  interested private stakeholders and \\nstrengthen the public -private partnership.  \\n11.7.3  Strategies for Primary Education  \\nBuilding on the progress in the 7FYP, the 8FYP will address the outstanding issues and challenges related \\nto primary education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce  dropout, absenteeism : Despite schemes such as stipend distribution, school lunches, free \\ntextbook distribution, etc., dropout rate at primary education is still almost 20 per cent . Dropping \\nout at the primary level does not represent any value -addition to  human capital for students and is \\na resource -drain. Greater incentives to families to keep their children in school, specially the girl, \\nwill be developed under the 8FYP. In addition, regular  parents –teachers meeting will be done to \\ndiscuss students’  performances and progress, inform parents about the current system and \\nchildren’s future career path, and deliberate on feasible future options.  Greater accountability of \\nteachers and heads to maintain regular attendance and timeliness will be maintained. ICT and \\ndevelopment of digital rosters for the teaching staff will be done.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Better quality outcome in education : The 8FYP will place emphasis on improvements in the quality \\nof education outcome. This includes updated curriculum and pedagogy, improved physica l \\nfacilities, teaching professionals, curriculum, books and supplies and parent involvement in \\nstudent’s education. Strong attention will be placed on ICT subjects.  \\n\\uf0b7 Create better citizens : upgrading of the curriculum may comprise inclusion of modules about  basic \\nmoral, safety, and awareness issues of day -to-day lives (such as daily health care, climate change, \\nenvironmental pollution, etc.) at the primary, and perhaps all levels. There may also be some \\nactivities/practical experience in the curriculum on co mmunity engagement for developing social \\nresponsibility of the future generation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop better tools to measure learning outcomes : Under the 8FYP, there will be greater focus \\non developing tools to properly quantify the learning -outcomes by the students that focus on \\ncompetency and understanding, not just ability to pass an exam.    \\n \\n641 \\n 11.7.4  Strategies for Secondary Education  \\nThe PEDP -IV and SESIP projects are very comprehensive and encompass all the aspects of the \\ndevelopment of the primary and secondary ed ucation. Implementation of these programmes  will be \\nstrengthened.  Additionally, the following actions will be incorporated in the 8FYP.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop better tools to measure learning outcomes : Secondary level is the stepping -stone for \\ntertiary and vocational ed ucation. Weak learning at this level could potentially jeopardize any \\ninvestment at the tertiary level. Steps  will be taken to enhance quantifiable learning outcomes of \\nthe students. Since the NSA conducted by DPE indicates that learning outcomes are low a t the \\nprimary level, a similar national assessment at secondary level will be undertaken as a first step.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reforming the examination and evaluation method of students learning: Ministry of Education has \\nembark ed on reforming the examination and evaluation m ethod of students learning. Emphasis is \\nbeing given to evaluate students ‘acquisition  of course contents and not rote learning. With a view \\nto ensure quality, validity, and reliability  of examination and assessment system in Bangladesh an \\nautonomous instit ution National Examination and Assessment Centre  (NEAC) will be established \\nsoon. Initiatives have already undertaken for setting up the body. Enactment of ‘The National \\nExamination and Assessment Centre  Act 2020’ is under process .  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase science enrolm ent: The low number of students who appear for science subjects in SSC \\nand HSC is not aligned with the growth and development targets of the government. This will be \\nchanged in the 8FYP period. Training for science teachers, identification of high -potentia l students \\nat a young -age and streamlining them into the science streams will address this problem. Regular \\ncorrespondence between institutions and students/parents, to discuss future plans and career \\naspirations, and additional remedial assistance for str uggling students will be provided.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of Common Curriculum up to class X:  Following the recommendations of the Hunter \\ncommission, constituted under the leadership of Sir William Wilson Hunter, a single stream \\nSecondary Education System was introd uced in British India in 1883. This system continued till \\n1959. Many education commissions were constituted from 1883 to 1959. All these commissions \\nrecommended continuing the common curriculum for all secondary level students. But, in 1959 \\nduring the mart ial law regime of Ayub Khan secondary education was divided into three groups: \\nscience, commerce and arts. In 1972 Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman constituted the Dr. \\nQudrat -i-Khuda education commission. The commission recommended introducing a unitrack \\ncurriculum for all secondary level students in 1974. It is difficult for a ninth grader to decide on his \\nfuture education at this age (13+ years). This puts a lot of stress on him which can hinder his/her \\nmental and physical development. Moreover, all seco ndary level students must be provided with \\nequal and equitable education. This is one of the goals of SDG -4. In order to build a skilled \\nmanpower to cope with the challenges of the upcoming 4IR, all secondary level students have to \\nstudy science, commerce and arts equally. Considering all these aspects government has decided \\nintroducing a unitrack curriculum instead of multi group curriculum up to grade -X. \\n\\uf0b7 Improve equity:  Disparity is another challenge in the secondary level. The gross  enrolment for \\npoor a nd non -poor at the secondary level are 24 per cent  and 76 per cent  respectively, indicating \\nhigh inequity in this level. The most likely cause for this is that struggling poor secondary students \\nparticularly boys are employed in family farms/businesses by their parents who see no return in \\ncontinuing the education of their child. The girls on the other hand are sent to perform paid/unpaid   \\n \\n642 \\n household work.  Child marriage, despite legal restrictions, is common practice too. Another \\ncommon problem in poor hous eholds is that they tend to send the boys to school and use the girls \\nto perform for paid/unpaid household works. Generous stipends to students and financial incentives \\nto parents will be provided under the 8FYP to reduce this disparity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Greater role of I CT-based learning : A number of ICT labs have already been established in \\nsecondary level institutions and finally all institutions will be equipped with modern ICT labs. \\nTeacher s are given training on ICT subject and ICT -based learning system. Conversion o f \\nclassrooms into Multimedia Classrooms is underway. Already 15% of classrooms have been \\nconverted into multimedia classrooms and remaining classrooms will be converted by 2023. During \\nCOVID19 pandemic, ICT based learning system has been proven as a very e ffective tools for \\nconducting classroom activities remotely in emergency situation. On the basis of this lesson, \\nMinistry of Education has undertaken initiatives to build permanent ICT -based learning \\ninfrastructure that would help keeping the students’ los ses at minimum level during any natural \\ndisaster. To speed up the integration of ICT with the education system, the Government’s a2i \\nproject initiated several steps with the Ministry of Education. Shikhok Batayan is an exceptional \\nexample of such initiativ e. It has 245,049 contents with 953 model contents. The government has \\na plan to involve 900,000 teachers in this initiative by 2021. The 8FYP will adopt a framework to \\nensure that at least one hour of learning in using these web contents in all primary an d secondary \\nschools in school premises are in place.   \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of Pre -VOC and VOC in secondary level education:  Pre-VOC and VOC courses in \\ndifferent trade will be introduced in secondary level  education so that students would complete \\ntheir secondary l evel education with some vocational skills. Already piloting is completed in 640 \\nschools and all the secondary students will be enrolled in such courses by 2023.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve the reputation of TVET stream : In Bangladesh, the weak reputation of TVET largely \\nprevents enrolment  in it. The first step would be to introduce TVET courses at a very early age, \\nfrom the primary level. Demonstrating a clear path to the students and their families from TVET \\neducation to reputable and gainful employment can be one mode of im proving the social acceptance \\nof TVET. In many developed countries, in Switzerland for example, from around age 16, more than \\ntwo-thirds of students stop full -time education and start vocational education programmes  in which, \\none-third of companies in the country participate. Students gain early and direct understanding of \\nthe job market demands and can make better decisions for their future. With a more immersive \\nexperience, all students naturally consider both their options (technical or higher education) , mid -\\nway through their secondary experience, and when time comes, make an informed decision based \\non their relevant and practical experiences. This is an example of the secondary education and \\nTVET working in tandem. A similar set -up will be introduced in  Bangladesh where students are \\nencouraged to undertake internship/apprenticeship programmes  to learn computer technology and \\nother hard skills. This will create a better and firmer linkage between industries, institutions, and \\nthe students. Continuous comm unication between them will also facilitate early detection in skills -\\nshortages and course -revisions. Early exposure to the workspace will also change the mind -set of \\nstudents and their parents that it is not the particular education streams that provide d egrees or a \\ncertificate  but skills that allow one to perform well at a job.  \\n   \\n \\n643 \\n \\uf0b7 Better industry -academia collaboration : Despite the importance of it, some structural rigidities and \\nlack of incentives are limiting the development of a formal framework for indu stry-academia \\ncollaboration. Fiscal incentives for industries, stipends for students, and recognition for TVET \\ninstitutions for placing their students in industries will be adopted to overcome this. Labour  Law \\n2013 states that all industries that employ at  least 50 workers must have at least 10 per cent  of \\napprentices. To make this law effective, the 8FYP will provide incentives to the industry. A similar \\nsupport for the TVET institutions will be provided to help them expand technical and vocational \\ntrainin g to the local level. The government will also provide subsidized training program with \\nemployment counselling  to attract youths in skill training program.  \\n\\uf0b7 Under the SDG target 4.1, compulsory free education of the first 12 years has to be achieved for \\nall children by 2030. This will imply that the children aged 15 -18 will be at school, with a \\nconsequent reduction in the incidence of child labour and youth NEET. To achieve this target 8FYP \\nwill encourage more private sector investment in education in additi on to more  allocation of budget \\nin education sector.  \\n11.7.5  Strategies to Develop the Madrasa Stream  \\nGreater involvement of external stakeholders in designing the curriculum and implementing innovative new \\nteaching methods would improve the quality of the  madrasa stream. To that end, under the 8FYP, madrasa \\neducation will be streamlined and brought under the national education board. While this will facilitate \\naccreditation through more involvement of science, mathematics and ICT related subjects, the \\nempl oyability of graduates will be ensured.  \\nTeachers training : changes in the curriculum and pedagogy will not be fruitful unless they are coupled \\nwith better trained teachers. In Aliya madrasa only 23 per cent  of the teachers are trained. Among 113,368 \\nteache rs only 19.66 per cent  have NTRCA. As improvements are made to the curriculum and new subjects \\nemphasized on, the existing teachers will be provided appropriate training to be able to teach the new \\nmaterial. In addition, the stream requires more female tea chers; 55.24 per cent  of female students are taught \\nby 12.7 per cent  of female teachers. The 8FYP will provide resources to encourage, train and subsequently \\nrecruit more female trained teachers for madrasas.  \\nBetter linkage with TVET institutions : Studies  have shown that many students who are struggling at the \\nsecondary education level will have better earning outcomes if they switch to the TVET stream. It is likely \\nthe TVET -stream can help a large number of madrasa -students as well. To make that happen, 8 FYP will \\nintroduce technical  education at the Dakhil and Alim level. Madrasa -TVET partnerships will play catalytic \\nroles in transforming pedagogical architecture of the madrasa.  \\nICT in madrasa : Availability of computer and a multimedia -device in Aliya madr asas, introduction of ICT -\\nbased education, and programming courses will be undertaken under the 8FYP. All these will improve the \\nquality of graduates coming out of the madrasa -stream, and reduce the learning -gap between madrasa -\\ngraduates and general gradua tes. \\nBetter transparency and management of funds : Qawmi madrasas are privately funded, mostly by private \\ndonations. Under the 8FYP, transparency in funding will be established to help strengthen the management \\nof these madrasas.    \\n \\n644 \\n 11.7.6  Strategies for High er Education  \\nThe Government has already recognized the need for investing in tertiary education and has made it a \\npriority sector for interventions during the 6FYP and the 7FYP. These strategies are drawn from the \\nNational Skill Development Policy 2011 and  the Strategic Plan for Higher Education in Bangladesh 2018 -\\n2030. All of these strategies are consistent with the National Education Policy 2010.  The implementation \\nof these strategies will be further consolidated in the 8FYP.  In addition, the following actions will be taken.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase focus on STEM fields : The quality of the higher/tertiary level of education is of paramount \\nimportance in the current development process and targets of the country. Number of students \\nstudying sciences subjects in the secon dary level is notably very low. The situation is exacerbated \\nat the higher level where a large number of science students migrate to business/commerce/social \\nscience streams. The reverse -migration to science subjects almost never takes place. The 8FYP will  \\nencourage larger number of students (and parents) to persist with STEM  subjects through \\nscholarships, career counselling and information sharing through mass media. Since tougher \\ncurricula require  better teachers, greater resources will also be mobilized in training and educating \\nteachers at the STEM  fields.  \\n\\uf0b7 Government and private sector collaborations : Public -private partnership (PPP) plays a vital role \\nto develop market driven skills system and professional skills according to industries\\' demand. Both \\nNEP 2010 and NSDP 2011 espouse the idea that PPPs are imperative in the establishment and \\nmanagement of new TVET institutions. Currently there are hundreds of large and small NGOs \\nwhich are offering short, non -accredited training courses with duration of 4 -6 months. Due to \\ninstitutional constraints, their enrolment capacities are small. The 8FYP will undertake polices in \\nthis context and to strengthen the partnership between GO and NGOs.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase the number of training institutions : Continuous training of the  trainers will help develop \\na dynamic TVET system. There are only two major public teachers training centres  with 37 teachers \\nin Bangladesh as opposed to more than 50,000 teachers employed in various TVET institutions \\naround the country. The 8FYP will take  steps to increase the number of training institutions for \\ntrainers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce the gender -gap: Gender -parity is established in primary and secondary level but not at the \\ntertiary/higher levels and in the TVET sector. Male students outnumber female students al most by \\n3:1 ratio in universities. To ensure equal rights for men and women Bangladesh Government has  \\nadopted a National Women’s Development Policy (NWDP) in 2011. However, anti -female social \\nbiases create challenges in implementing the policy and female l abour force participation rate is \\nconsiderably lower (36 per cent ) than male (82 per cent ). Establishing public universities just for \\nwomen, generous scholarships and other funding packages under the 8FYP will help narrowing \\nand eventually eliminating the gap.  \\n\\uf0b7 Greater collaboration with internationally reputed universities : In order to increase competition, \\nreputed universities of the world may be allowed to open their campuses in Bangladesh. Student -\\nexchange program between the universities, visiting prof essors from foreign universities, \\nshared/joint courses and degree programmes  can be offered. Such collaborations will have spill \\nover effects in improving the management and performance of local university administrations and \\nacademic staff. Some Middle Ea stern countries, Malaysia, and China have started this endeavour  a   \\n \\n645 \\n long time ago and have been reaping the benefits of it. STEM  focused universities should be \\nprioritized. If this proves to be a lengthy process to undertake, in the short -run, UGC can partn er \\nwith a few universities and follow their guidance to regularly update the curriculum. 8FYP will \\nexpedite such collaboration.  \\n\\uf0b7 More focus on research and publication: Much emphasis is needed to place on faculty research \\nand publication. In this regard, qu ality of publications will be stressed just as much as quantity. \\nSalary increments, promotion, tenure, etc. will be linked with research and publications, in addition \\nto other objective assessments.  \\n\\uf0b7 The industry -academia linkage and placement programmes : The industry -academia collaboration \\nhelps updating curriculum and prepares the students to find relevant jobs as well as help industries \\nto find their required skills.  The 8FYP will facilitate this collaboration.  \\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of skill driven courses in po st graduate colleges:  With a view to enhancing skills, \\ndifferent skill driven courses will be introduced in post gradu ate colle ges under National \\nUniversity. This endeavour  will definitely help increasing employability of national university \\ngraduates.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the University Grants Commission (UGC):  The UGC is the lead institution for \\npromoting higher education. It has played a major role in expanding the supply of higher education \\nin Bangladesh through its accreditation role for private providers and t hrough grants for both public \\nand private higher education institutions. The UGC needs to be further strengthened to ensure \\nexpanded tertiary enrolment and quality enhancement. Accordingly, the 8FYP will strengthen the \\nUGC to take a leadership role in stre ngthening university education and advanced academic \\nresearch. This will include restructuring the UGC to boost its capacity as the leader in the policy \\nmatters and ensuring transparency and accountability in the academic, financial and administrative \\naffairs in the universities.  A unified teachers ‘recruitment  framework will be introduced for all \\npublic universities to bring the uniformity and transparency in this area.  \\n11.7.7  Strategies for Adult Literacy and Non -Formal Education  \\nThe 8FYP will build on t he progress made during the 7FYP and continue the march towards 100 per cent  \\nadult literacy rate for both male and female by the end of the plan. The strategy will emphasize imparting \\nbasic literacy skills with a view to moving towards the global concept o f lifelong learning, which has been \\nincluded in the SDG education goal and targets.  This will be done by connecting literacy to basic skills \\ndevelopment and lifelong learning opportunities and envisage learning provisions, facilities, and resources \\ncomple menting and supplementing the formal education system. Widespread use of ICT resources for \\norganised lifelong learning, e.g., through a nationwide network of community learning centres, and \\nexpanding self -learning opportunities, will be key features of non -formal education and lifelong learning. \\nLiteracy level of the population, non -formal and informal livelihood and life skills development, and ICT -\\nbased access to information and self -learning tools and resources would be supported and promoted in a \\ncoordi nated way through a lifelong learning strategy.  \\nTable 11. 9 summarizes the goals, targets, and the input, output and impact indicators to monitor the progress \\nin NFE under the 8FYP.    \\n \\n646 \\n Table 11. 9: Non -Formal Education, 8FYP Targets and Monitoring Indicators  \\nGoals Target to attain  Input indicators  Output indicators  Impact indicators  \\nElimination of \\nilliteracy/ \\nproviding basic \\nliteracy  Basic literacy provided \\nto 33.79 million1 \\nadolescent and adult \\nilliterates  Financial allocation, \\ndevelopment of \\nlearning material , etc.  33.79 adolescent and \\nadult illiterates to \\nbecome literate.

As artificial intelligence is replacing routine/repetitive jobs \\nmostly performed by the low and semi -skilled workers, many developing countries including Bangladesh \\nwill lose their comparative advantage in low -skilled labour -intensive production process as a result. The \\nfourth industrial revolution will make a structural transformation towards a knowledge -based society where \\nthe demand for high -income cognitive jobs, low -income manual jobs, and jobs that involve operating and \\nmaintenance of artificial int elligence, will be in greater demand. This implies that adapting to the 4IR will \\nrequire workforce that is equipped with hard and soft skills. For combating the challenges of 4th industrial \\nrevolution, ICT specialist skills and basic programming are no lon ger enough. For instance, advanced \\nengineering and experience with machine learning are increasingly important. In addition, ICT specialists \\nalso need domain -specific knowledge, given the potential applications of ICT in business, health, education \\nand ind ustry. There is a need to rethink the curriculum and pedagogy to make graduates more comfortable \\nwith critical thinking, collaboration, ability to continuously learn and adapt, and be prone to picking up the \\nother necessary soft skills along the way. The s trategies and policies that will be undertaken in the 8FYP to \\ndeal with skills constraints under the 4IR are discussed below.  \\nAdapt to lifelong learning models of education : The overall approach to education in Bangladesh will be \\nadapted to stimulate the curiosity, creativity, and inquisitiveness of students so that they become lifelong \\nlearners - open and able to adapt to new environment and experiences in the workspace - at all levels, \\nincluding pre -primary, TVET, and the madrasa stream. This means chang es to the entire framework of \\neducation, including syllabus, type of pedagogy used, modes of delivering lessons, modes of assessment, \\netc. Demands of the workspace are going to rapidly change and then continue to keep changing in the \\ncoming industrial revo lution. Consistent with the global patter, schools and universities can no longer hope \\nto equip students and graduates with all the skills they will need for a lifetime. This realization has to take \\nroot among the students and their families, educators, an d policy -makers. Workers are no longer going to \\nbe picking a career and grow with that one singular role. Many of the existing jobs may disappear and   \\n \\n647 \\n majority of the jobs of future does not yet exist. Therefore, the role of education institutions in develo ping \\nlifelong learners is crucial.  In addition, education and training systems of ICT need to better assess and \\nanticipate changing skills needs in order to adapt programmes  and initiatives offered and guide \\nstudents/workers towards choices that lead to g ood outcomes.  \\nIncrease focus on ICTs : To ensure descent jobs and entrepreneurship under SDG target 4.4, substantial \\nincreases in number of youth and adults will need to have the relevant skills including technical and \\nvocational training. Under the digital  Bangladesh Initiative (DBI) of the Government several Acts and \\npolicies have been undertaken: The ICT Policy 2009, the ‘Strategies Priorities for Digital Bangladesh \\n2011’, and ICT Policy 2015.  In addition, Prime Minister’s office initiated the Access to Information (a2i) \\nproject with the objective of improving accountability and transparency of all government offices, to \\nprovide better services to citizens. ICT -based education is mainstreamed under the NEP, under which \\nimportant progress has been made. Im portantly, many youths trained themselves with ICT and are self -\\nemployed currently. Bangladesh is now the world’s second largest supplier of online labour. The 8FYP will \\nbuild on this progress and place greater emphasis on this sector by resolving the issu e of high taxation and \\nallocation of more funds, particularly in the public academic institutions, to fast track the spread of the ICT \\nrevolution in all academic institutions.  Furthermore,  there will be increased focus on technical and \\nprofessional skills including ICT specialist skills for workers who can initiate innovation and to support \\ndigital infrastructure and the true functioning of the digital eco -system.  \\nThe Skill for Employment and Investment (SEIP) : A major initiative to develop skill is the SEI P program \\ntaken by  the government and supported by the Asian Development Bank. SEIP has been relatively \\nsuccessful in training a large number of workers, placing them in jobs, and these workers then maintaining \\ntheir jobs. It is a multi -tranche program tha t has been implemented since 2014 and is planned to continue \\ntill 2024. Expected impact of the project is increased employment in priority sectors through creation of \\nimproved skills. The project has four major components/outputs: market responsive inclusi ve skills training \\ndelivered; quality assurance system strengthened; institutions strengthened; and effective program \\nmanagement and governance system ensured.  The 8FYP will develop and convert this experience into an \\neconomy wide training program encompa ssing all formal employment activities. The successful \\nperformance under the first 2 tranches of SEIP funding is given in Box 11.2.  \\nIncrease focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields : The STEM  \\nsubjects help to develop soft an d hard skills  as well as soft managerial skills , which are essential to take \\nadvantage from the 4IR. The 8FYP will seek to sharply increase the focus on STEM  through scholarships, \\njob counselling and advocacy using mass media.  Parent -teacher conferences a t school level will also be \\nused to create awareness among parents to guide their children towards STEM  subjects.    \\nMaking market -oriented training and curriculum : The education system needs to be adaptable and \\ndynamic to c hanging market scenarios and dem ands of the new industries. One of the major reasons of the \\npresent supply demand mismatch and low employability of graduates of Bangladesh is the rigidity of \\ncurricula and age -old classroom -based teaching. NSDA has tried to make the curriculum up -to-date and \\nflexible with little success. There are two major impediments to this: the lack of appropriate and timely \\ninput from industries to change the curriculum, and the lack of modern amenities and facilities available to \\nstudents and trainers to facilitate u pgrading the outdated curriculum to a more modern one. The government \\ncan obviously step -in and provide training, up -skilling, and re -skilling facilities that are frequently upgraded   \\n \\n648 \\n to reflect the changing times. However, for these schemes to be successfu l, it is important to change the \\nmind -set of the students in schools and universities as well. The meaning of getting an education has to \\nchange from learning a trade or learning a skill to learning how to learn and how to be a self -starter.  \\nThe role of TV ET: TVET can be useful to utilize some of the potential benefits of the fourth industrial \\nrevolution. However, a revision of the TVET curriculum is crucial for this. The curriculum will be updated \\nby including new courses, which can train the workforce wit h the higher order cognitive skills needed for \\nexample project management, cloud computing, computer technology, data analysis, marketing among \\nother activities. The change in mind -set is also an important factor in this context, to enrol  ‘good’ students \\nat this stream.  The government is rightly aware of this challenge. The TVET Reform Project of 2008 -15, \\nthe NSDP 2011 and the adoption of the STEP and SEIP projects are all aimed at addressing this concern. \\nIn addition to modernize and update the education c urriculum of TVET, importance would be given to up-\\nskilling and re -skilling workers and creation inclusive digital infrastructure  \\n11.9 8FYP INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING  \\nThe 8FYP seeks to build up the human capital base of Bangladesh to prepare for the increasingly growing \\ndemand for skilled labour in all economic activities.  The education, training and skills strategy discussed \\nin this chapter seeks to respond effectively to that need.  Additionally, investments in science and \\ntechnology and IC T services discussed in chapter 12 will play a complementary role in upgrading the skill \\nbase of Bangladesh required to move towards HIC status.  The total allocations for education, training, \\nscience, technology and ICT will be substantially increased  in the 8FYP.  The ADP allocations for the \\neducation ministries / divisions are shown in Table 11. 10 and Table 11.1 1 in current and constant FY2021 \\nprices. Given limited resources, the 8FYP will focus strongly on good governance, sound program \\nimplementation a nd inter -ministerial coordination of all relevant ministries/ agencies that contribute to the \\ndevelopment of education and training.   \\nTable 11. 10: ADP Allocations for Human Development in the 8FYP  \\n(Taka billion current prices)  \\nMinistry / Division  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education  89.5 113.0  133.0  158.3  193.7  \\nSecondary and Higher Education Division  61.4 92.3 106.4  136.6  171.3  \\nTechnical and Madrasah Education Division  8.5 13.8 21.3 31.0 37.2 \\nTotal Education  159.4  219.1  260.7  325.9  402.2  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 11.1 1: ADP Allocations for Human Development in the 8FYP  \\n(Taka billion FY2021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry/ Division  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education  89.5 107.3  120.1  136.3  159.2  \\nSecondary and Higher Education Division  61.4 87.6 96.1 117.6  140.8  \\nTechnical and Madrasah Education Division  8.5 13.1 19.2 26.7 30.6 \\nTotal Education  159.4  208.0  235.4  280.6  330.6  \\nSource:  Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 12:  \\nDIGITAL BANGLADESH AND INFORMATION \\nCOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY  \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n651 \\n CHAPTER 12  \\nLEVERAGING DIGITAL BANGLADESH  \\nAND ICT STRATEGY FOR HIGHER GROWTH  \\n12.1 OVERVIEW  \\nGradually, Bangladesh economy and society are in the grip of a digital revolution that is changing the way \\nwe work, interact with people and institutions, produce goods and services, and trade across borders. Central \\nto this fast -evolving phenomenon in human civilization is information and communications technology \\n(ICT) - the internet and digital ecosystem - compounded by an endless series of technological innovation \\nthat constantly feeds into each other, creating a digital economy characterized by rising productivity. In a \\nsense, GDP growth in Bangladesh is the aggre gation of this rising productivity across all economic \\nactivities around the country.  \\nIn the most fundamental sense, there are only two ways of increasing the output of the economy: (a) increase \\nthe quantum of inputs that go into the productive process, o r (b) innovate new ways to get more output from \\nthe same quantum of inputs. “Doing more with less” is the core feature of productivity growth. The widely \\naccepted growth accounting methodology attribute GDP growth to factor inputs: physical capital (capita l \\naccumulation), labour force adjusted for skill attainments, and the residual role of increases in the efficiency \\nwith which those factors are used (total factor productivity --TFP). Lately, the focus of growth economics \\nhas been on TFP growth as a critica l driver of growth acceleration. High productivity of factors of \\nproduction depends on capital investment (human and physical), improvements in institutional efficiency \\nand governance, all of which could be compounded by progress in digital economy.  \\nIn the  past quarter century developed countries have experienced higher TFP growth arising from \\ninnovation and technological transformation in the overall digital economy. Evidence from Bangladesh \\nreveals that TFP growth played little or no part in GDP growth du ring the first two decades after \\nindependence. Rise in labour productivity fuelled by capital accumulation (or capital deepening) was the \\nprimary driver of growth. But over the past quarter century the contribution of TFP growth has been rising. \\nThis rise in TFP growth stems in large part from the spread of ICT and the growing penetration of the \\ninternet and digital systems across the economy and society. Technological transformation has started \\nplaying an important part in growth acceleration.  \\nDigital Ban gladesh – both a source and product of the knowledge economy – has been underpinned by the \\nICT sector in all its manifestations of modern technology. Under PP2041, Bangladesh seeks to achieve HIC \\nstatus by FY2041.  To secure this target, it is imperative t hat Bangladesh keeps expanding value creation \\nin economic output through ideas and knowledge so that the economy g raduates from factor -driven stage \\nto a knowledge -based economy —through both process and product innovation. Over the decades, ICT’s \\nhumble beg inning as computerization of information processing work, particularly within office \\nenvironment, and its recent progress in digitization of public services have been progressing towards the \\ndevelopment of the knowledge economy. Particularly, the technolog y track driving the Fourth Industrial   \\n \\n652 \\n Revolution (4IR) has strong footing in ICT. Standing at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, the \\n8FYP is at a critical juncture in planning Bangladesh’s journey to leverage as well as cope with the \\nchallenges of an ICT driven digital economy.  \\nDespite all the progress made, the Government’s mid -term evaluation of the 7FYP finds, “The global \\nstandards of the Knowledge Economy are far away from the present situation of Bangladesh. Bangladesh \\nhas performed as one of the low ranked economies in the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index.” This \\nreality raises the bar for the 8FYP to target rapid progress in key indicators measuring the strength of digital \\nand knowledge economy.  \\nBy the time the 8FYP will be in effect, the economy of Bangladesh will be at a recovery stage from the \\nlocal and global shock caused by COVID 19. While the pandemic caused distress across all sectors it also \\nrevealed the significance of ICT as a tool to securing connectivity for maintaining and managing critical \\noperations for sustenance. The education sector pivoted to online education system, farmers connected to \\nconsumers through e -commerce, mobile money became a major channel for trade, and telemedicine  gained \\ntraction for health service deli very. ICT became the lifeline for finance, education, agriculture, health, skill \\nand employment. Digital transformation has become pivotal for both the public sector and the private sector. \\nICT will thus work not only as a vertical but also as a cross cutt ing sector to boost the performance and \\nprogress against targets as stipulated in this 8FYP for other sectors.  \\n12.2 LEVERAGING DIGITAL ECONOMY FOR HIGHER GROWTH  \\nDuring the implementation of the 7FYP, significant progress was made in expanding Internet connectiv ity, \\nand smartphone penetration in Bangladesh. The 8FYP is all set to further expand the role of digital data and \\ntechnologies as instruments for growth acceleration. Access to data and the ability to transform data into \\ndigital intelligence have become cr ucial for the competitiveness of firms, and also for the Government. It’s \\nworth noting that mobile financial service in Bangladesh has been expanding its footprint from simple \\nmoney transfer to preferred mode of retail and utility payments. Such progressio n has uplifted the role of \\nICT from offering connectivity, supporting information exchange, and business process automation to \\ndigital economy. The concept of the digital economy has become commonplace to describe how digital \\ntechnology is changing pattern s of production, distribution and consumption of goods and services affecting \\neconomic outputs, consequentially growth. Given the evolving penetration of the digital economy in our \\nlives and livelihoods it makes strategic sense to leverage this technologic al evolution for achieving broad -\\nbased targets in the 8FYP. Some of the relevant aspects of the digital economy are outlined below.  \\nValue and trend in digital economy: The evolving digital economy is closely associated with several \\nfrontier technologies a nd fuelled by data. Some of these frontier technologies are sensors, data analytics, \\nAI, 3D printing, Robotics, Cloud computing and 5G connectivity. They also underpin the fourth industrial \\nrevolution. Despite the growth of global IP traffic from 100 GB pe r day in 1992 to 46,600 GB per second \\nin 2017, which is likely to shot up to 1,500,700 GB per second in 2022, the world is only in the early days \\nof the data -driven economy. And Bangladesh is showing similar trend. For example, as reported by BTRC, \\ninterna tional internet bandwidth consumption increased by 228 GB per second ( gbps) to 900 Gaps  at the \\nend of November, 2018 from 672 Gaps  in June.    \\n \\n653 \\n Bandwidth consumption by the country’s internet users was 411 gbps in June, 2017. In June, 2016, \\ncountry’s total int ernational bandwidth consumption was 265 gbps while it was 186 Gaps  in December, \\n2015 and only 8 Gaps  in 2009. Basically, over the last 10 years, data traffic in Bangladesh has grown by \\nover 100 times. During this period, Internet penetration has also grow n from less than 1 million to over 100 \\nmillion. Unfortunately, there is no natural correlation between such growth in data consumption and socio -\\neconomic benefit, casual empiricism indicates fair contribution of mobile phone penetration or internet \\nadoptio n driving economic growth.  The 8FYP will promote deliberate measures to extract economic value \\nfrom growing production and sharing of internet data to enhance productivity of public services.  \\nThe core components in driving this explosion of data are: (i)  Devices and network connectivity supporting \\naccess and communication, (ii)  Digital and information technology (IT) sectors, which produce key \\nproducts or services that rely on core digital technologies, (iii) A wider set of digitalizing sectors, which \\nincludes those where digital products and services are being increasingly used, like e -Commerce and \\nInternet of Things ( Iota), and (iv) A set of technologies like sensors, artificial intelligence, block chain , 5G \\nbroadband, data analytics, and cloud computin g.  \\nGlobal review of value creation and capturing in digital economy: The growing power of digital \\nplatforms has global implications that are like ly to accentuate inequalities. For example, Internet advertising \\nrevenue share in global advertising revenue g rew from 15% in 2010 to 38% in 2017, which is expected to \\ngrow to 60% by 2023. And Google and Facebook, two US giants, took away 65% of this revenue in 2017. \\nThese two comp anies alone took away more than Taka 1,000 crore revenue s from Bangladesh in 2018. A s \\na result, the erosion of advertising as a viable revenue source for other businesses like newspaper outlets is \\na concern. Among other issues, monopolistic trends, how platform companies strengthen their market \\npositions, expansion into other sectors, Inf ormation asymmetry and data, and the need for engaging in \\nglobal policymaking are creating pressure on leveraging digital economy. Particularly, it has been a \\ngrowing challenge to Bangladesh.   \\nAssessing the scope of value creation and its capture in Bangl adesh: As global data platf orms have been \\nalready monopolised,  developing countries like Bangladesh should focus  on new product categor ies. To \\nleverage it, focus should be on addressing challenges of (i) small and fragmented local markets, (ii) \\ninadequate entrepreneurial knowledge and skills, (iii) lack of a highly skilled  and affordable workforce, (iv) \\nlimited access to finance, and (v) poor intellectual asset base and R&D capacity.  \\nIn order to accelerate Bangladesh’s GDP growth, we also need to focus on raising total factor productivity \\nthrough increased application of digital technology. Widespread Digitization is still an untapped \\nopportunity. TFP growth was 0.3 on an average for the period of 2005 -2016. According to projections in \\nthe Perspective Plan (2021 -2041), in order to achieve the high and sustained economic growth to be an \\nUMIC country by FY31 and a HIC by FY41, in addition to capital deepening, TFP must grow at an average \\nrate of 2.7% during 2021 -2031 and 3.6% during 2032 -2041 periods respectiv ely. Increasing the average \\nTFP from 0.3 observed in the last decade to 2.3% -4.5% range will be a massive undertaking and will \\nessentially require increasing the productivity of all factors of production. That is where ICT and the Digital \\nEconomy come  into play. A 2018 OECD report finds that firms with ICT use had, on average, 197% of the \\ntotal factor productivity (TFP) level of other businesses in Viet Nam, 153% in Indonesia, 139% in \\nMyanmar, and 139% in China.    \\n \\n654 \\n 12.3 OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS IN DIGITAL BANGLADESH P ROGRAM  \\nDigitization and service transformation  are moving ahead.  As a result, Bangladesh has moved up nine \\nsteps occupying 115th place among 193 countries in 2018 on the E -Governance Development index, \\npublished by the United Nations. The spread of ICT re volution has received particular emphasis based on \\nthe personal attention provided by the Honourable Prime Minister under her Digital Bangladesh Initiative. \\nDigital Bangladesh is an integral part of the government’s Vision 2041 . The Digital Bangladesh init iative \\nconsisting of four key priorities are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing human resources ready for the 21st century.  \\n\\uf0b7 Connecting citizens in ways most meaningful to them.  \\n\\uf0b7 Taking services to citizens’ doorsteps.  \\n\\uf0b7 Making the private sector and market more productive and com petitive through the use of digital \\ntechnology.  \\nBangladesh made important strides during the Sixth and the Seventh Five Year Plan in utilizing technology \\nto bring in tangible transformation in all four areas. Progress made in bringing government services to the \\ndoorsteps of citizen is probably the area where Bangladesh registered most significant progress.  \\nInformation and Communication Technology Division (ICTD) has taken initiatives to encourage and \\nprovide support for ICT related activities, formulate na tional ICT strategy and policies, create standards \\nand specifications of ICT tools for government organizations according to their necessity, work for human \\nresource development in ICT sector while cooperating with the Government and other agencies to \\nimplement the Digital Bangladesh Vision. Digital Bangladesh Vision has four pillars: (I) Connectivity and \\nInfrastructure, II. E -Government, III. Human Resource Development and IV. Industry Promotion  \\nICTD has undertaken numerous activities, projects, and polici es to fulfil the vision of Digital Bangladesh. \\nICT covers a vast area;  hence many of the following initiatives taken by ICTD may fall under multiple \\nbroad categories.  \\n12.3.1  Connectivity and Infrastructure  \\nConnectivity and infrastructure are the key compo nents of the Digital Bangladesh vision. To ensure \\nconnectivity all across the country Bangladesh Computer Council under ICT Division has been working \\ndiligently. Bangla -GovNet project has been implemented by BCC to build the ICT Backbone Network up \\nto 240 Ministry/Division/ Department, 64 Districts and 64 Upazila. Info-Sarker -II extends this network up \\nto the Upazila level, connects the government offices at district and Upazila level. The Info -Sarker Phase -\\n3 project has established broadband internet infra structure in 2600 unions across the country through the \\noptical fibre cable. 60 per cent  of the people of the country got access to the internet through this. In addition, \\nthe establishment of Virtual Private Network 1000 police offices of Bangladesh has b een done.  \\nEstablishment of Information and Communication Technology Network in remote areas (“Connected \\nBangladesh”) Project has established Information and Communication Technology Network to 772 remote \\nunions of the country. BCC has established National  Data Centre (Tier -3) where more than 25000 \\nGovernment domains, 260 applications, 417 VPN, File Servers 109 managed services, 16 collocation \\nservices, and 18059 Network Services have been hosted. Also, IV Tier Data Centre has been established \\nrecently whic h is 7th largest in the world. BCC has established Computer Lab in 3544 educational institutions.     \\n \\n655 \\n Bangladesh Hi -Tech Park Authority (BHTPA) has taken initiatives to establish Hi -Tech Park, Software \\nTechnology Park and IT Training & Incubation Centre throu ghout the country to promote IT/ITES sector \\nand to attract local & foreign investment. The initiatives will create huge employment opportunities and \\ndemand of skilled human resources. It will develop knowledge and capital -based industries in the country. \\nInformation technology, Software Technology, Bio -Technology, Renewable Energy, Green Technology, \\nIT Hardware, IT Enabled Services and R&D etc. are the major investment areas of IT/ITES sector in \\nBangladesh.  \\nBangladesh Hi -Tech Park Authority (BHTPA) has esta blished 4 Parks: (i) Bangabandhu Hi -Tech City, \\nKaliakoir, (ii) Sheikh Hasina Software Technology Park, Jashore, (iii) Software Technology Park, Janata \\nTower, (iv) Sheikh Kamal IT Training and Incubation Centre, Natore. 7.41 lakh square feet space for \\nIT/IT Es companies have been allocated. Basic infrastructure like fibre optic cable line, gas line, water line, \\nelectricity line, seaware line, water treatment plant and internal & external road, link road, solar street light, \\netc. have already been developed in  those parks.  \\nGovernment has declared attractive incentives for the promotion of IT/ITEs sector. BHTPA provides these \\nincentives to the IT companies in the IT/Hi -Tech parks. The incentives are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 12 years ex emption of Income Tax for park  develope rs.  \\n\\uf0b7 10 years ex emption of Income Tax for investors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Import Duty, Regularity Duty and  Supplementary Duty for local ly production of \\nATM machine and CC camera;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Duties on importing Capital Equipment and Construction Materials by the Investors;  \\n\\uf0b7 Hi-Tech Parks are declared as Bonded Warehousing Station;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Income Tax on Dividend, Share Transfer, Royalty, Technical Fees for investors;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemptions of Income Tax for Foreign Employees;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Income Tax on declared Dividend b y Park Developers;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of VAT during production level of goods by the Investors;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Duties on importing Goods/Materials to be used for the development of Hi -Tech \\nParks by the Park Developers;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of Duties on importing Transport by th e investor;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exemption of stamp duty on the deed registration/ mortgage deed registration;  \\nTo simplify and expedite service delivery BHTPA has launched online One Stop Service system under the \\nOne Stop Service law. As a result, an investor can easily get al l kinds of information and service related to \\nthe investment. Already 7 kinds of services have been delivered through these windows. The total \\ninvestment is about US$ 38 million and proposed investment is about US$ 281 million by the close of \\n8FYP . In the Hi-Tech Park, Mobile phone assembling company, Fibre Optic Cable Production Company, \\nBio-Tech Company, Software Developer Company and BPO, KOP, and Call centre related companies are \\nalready in operation.  \\n12.3.2 e-Government  \\nThe Government has launched a Master Plan for Digital Bangladesh Project for effective and efficient \\nimplementation of Digital Bangladesh Vision through the learning’s  from e -Government implementation   \\n \\n656 \\n experience of South Korean government.  Besides, a roadmap has also been formulated to bring different \\nministries/departments and departments/agencies under the Bangladesh National Enterprise Architecture \\nFramework. As part of the implementation of e -Government Master Plan 1 of the 46 initiatives suggested \\nin Master Plan report is being impl emented, titled ‘Digital Municipality Services S ystem’. The piloting \\nhas been implemented in 1 City Corporation & 9 Municipalities through which 5 online citizen’s services \\nwill be provided to more than 20 lac people. Digital Sylhet City Project has been i nitiated to turn Sylhet \\ninto country’s first smart city.  For automation of different government organizat ions, Bangladesh E -\\nGovernment ERP Project has developed common  ERP software (nine modules) primarily for use of nine \\norganizations under the Planning Division and ICT Division. Digital Island Moheshkhali Project has \\nimproved the quality of public services in an isolated region through the utilization of Information and \\nCommunications Technology (ICT) solutions. To ascertain the proper applicability of t he software and \\nhardware produced/developed/purchased by different government departments/agencies and maintain its \\nquality Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) has established Software and Hardware Quality Testing & \\nCertification Centre.  Based on leading st andards, practices and frameworks, but aligned and tailored as \\nper Bangladesh requirements and strategic objectives, Bangladesh Nation al Digital Architecture (BNDA) \\nproject has created Bangladesh National Digital Architecture framework. Design, development  and \\nimplementation of interoperability framework across the GoB have been developed through this project. \\nTo establish Bangla in computing as a leading language at the global platform, Enhancement of Bangla \\nLanguage in ICT through Research & Development ( 1st Revised) project has been working to standardize \\nvarious features of Bangla language and develop Tools, Technologies and Contents for Bangla computing. \\nBCC has developed BGD e -GOV CIRT (Computer Incidence Response Team) to improve the cyber \\nsecurity  defence capability of Bangladesh Government.  \\nThese six CA organizations are now providing digital signature certificates and related services to various \\ngovernment and private organizations and to interested individuals. In the meantime, digital signature is  \\nbeing used for E -TIN, e -File system of A2i, birth registration and online admittance letter of the National \\nUniversity. Different governmental and non -governmental organizations and banks have already started \\nusing digital signatures in their own websites  and individual level.  \\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection was established to make link with NID database of the \\nElection Commission to verify user information for issuing digital signature. E -Tender and e -file systems \\nwere launched at Office of th e Controller of Certifying Authorities. This office received membership of the \\nOIC-CERT (Organization of the Islamic Cooperation -Computer Emergency Response Teams ).  Website \\nof this office was developed under the National Portal platform.  \\nDigital Forensic Lab was established to control and investigate cybercrimes under the project \\n\"Improvement of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure System) and Capacity Building of the CCA Office\" and \\nPKI systems was upgraded. By establishing a world -class\" PKI system, Cyber secu rity would be ensured \\nthrough the use of digital signature certificates for online transactions and information sharing.  \\nMuch progress has already been made on digital security awareness. Various groups in society, namely, \\ngirls, students, teachers, journa lists, and government officials, have been imparted training on cybercrime, \\nrelated laws, safety strategies on social network platforms, ways to get rid of crime, and specific procedures \\nto register complaints, and so on. An online service called ‘Digital Evidence Management & Reporting \\nSystem (DEMRS)’ was introduced in the CCA\\'s office for the prevention of crime investigation and \\nimmediate detection of offenders online.    \\n \\n657 \\n 12.3.3 Human Resource Development  \\nHuman resource development for the ICT sector is one  of the key focus es of ICT Division. Bangladesh \\nComputer Council through Leveraging ICT for Gro wth, Employment and Governance P roject has \\ndeveloped 32,000 skilled manpower for IT and ITES sector in the last five years. 536 women got Office \\nApplications & U nicode Bangla training under the WID Project. To integrate persons with disabilities in \\nthe mainstream of development BCC has initiated Empowerment of persons with disabilities including \\nNDD through ICT Project. Through this project, already 14 80 persons w ith disabilities got ICT training. \\nBCC is also introducing and promoting the ICT Professionals’ Professional Certification (ITEE) system in \\nBangladesh through Capacity Building on ITEE Management Project. Students are trained with the skillset \\nsuch as Japa nese Language, IT skills (including ITEE Level 2 Exam preparation) and Japanese business \\nmanner through this project.  \\nTo enhance the quality of education through ICT , the Department of ICT (DoICT ) is responsible to spread \\nICT based quality education and d eveloped IT skilled resource pool. A milestone project named Sheikh \\nRussel Digital Labs has been implemented all over the country  along with  15 in Saudi Arabia. Under this \\nproject some 4,176 labs have been established  nationally involving  secondary schools , colleges, madrasas, \\ntechnical institutions, and primary schools.   Phase by phase another 15,000 labs will be set up in Primary, \\nSecondary and Higher educational institutions. These schools will lead “School of future” with \\ncomprehensive plan. 100,000 stu dents of primary & secondary level will be trained in “Basic Programming, \\nIT Security and MS Office”. 36,000 teachers as master trainers and 20,000 youth in 9 different languages \\nwill be trained in future.  \\nFor empowering women  through ICT, a project has al ready been started named, “ She Power Project: \\nSustainable Development for Women through ICT” . The objective of the project is to increase nationwide \\nawareness of the significance of women empowerment and to increase women self -employment and \\nentrepreneursh ip through ICT. Through the \"Sustainable Development for Women through ICT\"  Project, \\ntraining was given to 4,000 women as Freelance to Entrepreneur, 4,000 women as IT Service Provider, and \\n2,500 women as Call Centre Agent.  \\n12.3.4 ICT Industry Promotion  \\nBangladesh Computer Council has played a vital role to promote ICT industry both locally and globally. \\nICT project has promoted local IT and ITES capabilities into the global market leading to improved global \\nawareness and perception of Bangladesh for IT and  ITES business. This project has also conducted ICT \\nCareer camp in 64 districts and reached more than 80,000 students of Bangladesh. Innovation Design & \\nEntrepreneurship Academy (IDEA) Project is promoting innovation and entrepreneurship across the \\ncountry  and provided funds to 64 start -ups totalling over Taka 5 crore. To promote local ICT Industry BCC \\nhas successfully organized Digital World 2015, 2016 & 2017.  \\nBangladesh Hi -Tech Park Authority is nursing and promoting IT Start -ups/IT Entrepreneurs to estab lish \\ngiant IT Company like Google/Apple/ Microsoft/Amazon/Alibaba. In this regard, BHTPA has allotted \\nspace, internet and electricity free of cost to 100+ selected local IT Start -ups/IT Entrepreneurs; some of \\nthem have already transformed into registered B PO/KPO/IT Company.    \\n \\n658 \\n Bangladesh Hi -Tech Park Authority is promoting local BPO/KPO/IT Companies for getting international \\nstandard like CMMIL -5, CMMIL -3, ISO - 9001 and ISO - 27001  etc. Already 2 companies -CMMIL -5, 21  \\ncompanies  CMMIL -3, 47 companies ISO- 9001, 6 companies ISO - 27001  have received international \\nstandard certification by the patronization of BHTPA.  \\n12.3.5 Acts, Guidelines, Rules and Policies by ICT Division  \\nICT Division has been formulating acts, guidelines, rules and policies related to ICT. In l ast 5 years ICT \\nDivision has formulated the following: National ICT Policy 2015, 2018, Digital Security Act  2018 , Public \\nEmail Policy 2018, National Digital Commerce Policy 2018, Cyber Security Strategy, BNDA Guidelines, \\nUser Policy for National Data Centr e, Secure Coding Guidelines, National Bangla Keyboard (BDS -1738: \\n2018), International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for Bangla (BDS 1970:2019), Bangla Sign Language (BDSL) \\n(BDS 1971: 2019) , Innovation Guideline Strategy & Policy, Innovation Guideline Strategy & Policy , \\nNational Blockchain Strategy, National Robotics Strategy, Big Data Strategy , Artificial Intelligence (AI) \\nStrategy, Internet of Things (IoT) Strategy, Strategy to Promote Microprocessor Design Capacity in \\nBangladesh, E-Service strategy, Digital S ervice Design Guideline & Strategy, Educational Technology \\nPortal Framework, E -Learning Guideline & Strategy, Covid 19 Protection & Remedy Guidelines, Critical \\nThinking & Problem -Solving Skills Strategy, Integrated Service Delivery Platform strategy, Integ rated \\nPayment Policy, Government to Person strategy, Digital Financial Ecosystem Strategy, R&D Equipment \\nImport Policy , R&D Products Raw Materials Import Policy , R&D Products Standardization Strategy & \\nPolicy , Amendment of IP Policy , National Hotline P olicy , E -Nothi Guideline, Amendment of Digital \\nGovernment Act for e -Nothi, E -Nothi implementation Roadmap, Amendment in Secretariat Instructions & \\nRules of Business, 4IR -Based Future Skills Policy, Conceptual Framework for Future of Work for \\nBangladesh  etc. \\nDifferent policy guidelines such as the Digital Certificate Interoperability Guidelines, PKI Auditing \\nGuidelines, and the  Certification Practice Statement (CPS) guidelines were prepared for enabling digital \\nsignature processes. A Cyber tribunal was set up for cyber -crime trial. Time Stamping Services Guidelines \\nfor Certifying Authorities was formulated in 2016. Cyber Security strategic Guidelines were  formulated. \\nThe draft of the Cyber Crime and Investigation Rules has been drafted for cybercrime investi gation. Beside \\nthis AI, IOT, Microprocessor Design and strategy have been formulated by ICT Division. Guideline for the \\nDeclaration of Privately Operated (Non -BHTPA) Software Technology Park has been formulated. Made in \\nBangladesh Policy is going to be fin alized soon.  \\n12.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS FOR DIGITAL ECONOMY IN THE 8FYP  \\nThe critical success factor is the creation and demonstration of a scalable model of profitable exploitation \\nof Digital Bangladesh Agenda, ICT and Knowledge Economy through the investment ma de in ICT \\ninfrastructure, R&D, and innovation, and adopting policies for creating the demand of scaling up this model \\nby the private sector. The overall strategy is to (i) make the Government smart lead user of digital \\ninnovations in meeting line ministrie s’ targets, (ii) strengthen the supply side of physical infrastructure, (iii) \\ndevelop human resources and prime the knowledge creation and exploitation through R&D, (iv) encourage \\nprivate sector to leverage ICT innovations in addressing competitiveness, (v ) empower ICT industry to \\nscale up investment and innovations to create global success stories by taking home market as the stepping \\nstone, (vi) attain redesign capability out of digital technologies so that material and energy need as well as   \\n \\n659 \\n wastage decr ease and yield increases in whatever Bangladesh produces, (vii) leverage digital economy for \\nharnessing the potential of fourth industrial revolution and attaining SDGs, and (viii) cope up as well as \\ntake the advantage from the unfolding fourth industrial revolution.  Here are some strategic areas in which \\ninterventions will be made during the 8FYP:  \\n1. Leveraging Line Ministry Centric Digital Economy Opportunities  \\n2. Adopting the Five Helix Approach  \\n3. Establishing cooperation between Industry, Academia, and Gover nment  \\n4. Intellectual Asset and Local and Global Market Centric Start -up Success Creation and Youth \\nEmpowerment while leveraging on local opportunities  \\n5. Leveraging of Redesign Capability for Creating Success in High -tech Devices and Innovation  \\n6. Turning high -tech Parks into Nucleus of Digital, Knowledge and Innovation Economy  \\n7. 4IR Productive Knowledge Acquisition  \\n8. Digital Economy for Leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution  \\n9. ICT for Greater Transparency, Good Governance, and Service Delivery  \\n10. Ensuring Equitable a nd Fair Share of Bangladesh in Global Digital Value Chain  \\n11. Leveraging Digital Economy for Attaining Sustainable Development Goals  \\n12. Intensifying Effectiveness and Efficiency, and Encouraging Private Investment  \\n13. Developing the Culture and National Innovation  System for Leveraging Knowledge Economy   \\n14. Harnessing the power of ICT for revival from the effect of COVID 19 and for adaptability to shocks \\narising from health crisis, natural disaster, climate change, or global shift in competitive landscape  \\nThese strate gic areas have been explained further along with suggested policies, program activities, and \\nindicators in following sub -sections.  \\n12.4.1 Leveraging Line Ministry Centric Digital Economy Opportunities  \\nIn achieving respective mission, every line ministry should strategically leverage digital innovations  to \\nensure smart and personalized public service . Focus should be on taking advantage of emerging digital \\ninnovations supporting local R&D, innovations, start -ups and industry. For example, ministry of \\ntrans portation should look into the opportunity of connectivity, on board  and roadside sensors and AI for \\nmonitoring driving behaviours and road conditions for reducing accidents, and enhancing throughputs. \\nBasically, every line ministry has the unfolding oppor tunity in the digital space. Moreover, leveraging of \\ndigital innovations for achieving mission objectives also supports the attainment of some critical SDGs \\nrelevant to energy, emission, and environment . ICT will also be a key driver for the line ministrie s for \\nmitigating COVID 19 impact. Key interventions or action agendas relevant for the line ministries for \\nCOVID response is highlighted further in this document.   \\n12.4.2 Five-Helix  \\nIn taking advantage of line ministry specific unfolding digital opportunit ies, the focus should be on five -\\nhelix approach: collaboration between (i) government, (ii) education and research organizations, (iii) \\nindustry, (iv) start -ups & entrepreneurs and (v) investors.     Along the attainment of mission objectives, it \\nwill prom ote digital transformation of the local ecosystem. But need to  be mindful  of the challenges implied \\nby “multiple helix” approaches to policy making. The organization and governance of such multi -  \\n \\n660 \\n stakeholder processes is complex and often challenges the pos sibility of ensuring that decisions follow an \\nagreed roadmap, respect defined roles and responsibilities, and are binding.  Line ministry centric digital \\neconomy strategy outline is shown in Table 12.1.  \\nTable 12.1: Line Ministry Centric Digital Economy St rategy Outline  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Indicators/Targets  Complementary \\nactivities  \\nTo keep monitoring global progress and envisioning line \\nministry specific unfolding digital possibilities  Number of \\ntechnologies and \\ninnovations tracked, \\nand num ber of \\npossibilities identified.  \\n \\nLocal value addition \\nthrough R&D and \\ninnovation.  \\n \\nCollaboration between \\nthe Government, \\nIndustry and Academia.  Vendor driven \\nprocurement of \\nimported ready to use \\napproach should be \\nsupplemented with \\nenvisioning the futu re \\npossibilities and \\nsupporting local R&D \\nfor increasing local \\nvalue addition, \\nstrengthening \\nacademia, and fostering \\ninnovation, start -ups \\nand industry.    Develop line ministry specific digital programmes  for \\naddressing key mission objectives.  \\nEstabl ish synergy line ministry specific digital \\nprogrammes  and establish nationwide programmes   \\nIdentify R&D issues for exploiting digital opportunities, \\nand support industry -academia collaboration to carry out \\nthem  \\nTake a series of demonstration projects , in partnership \\nwith industry and academia, for increasing the scope of \\nlocal value addition, and reducing risks in \\nimplementation  \\nRedesigning engineering programmes to meet the \\ntechnological requirements of the Government and \\nsupporting local digital  innovation industry  \\n \\nIt should be noted that the adaptation and diffusion of advanced digital technologies implies trial -and-error \\nprocesses. Scope should be created for gathering experiences from success and failure for meaningfully \\nmaking contributi on to the exploitation of unfolding digital technology opportunities. Informed choices \\nabout the desirable future of attaining line ministry specific mission objectives out of digital possibilities \\nrequire academic R&D, firms and governments to build on th eir strengths, recognize capability gaps and \\ntake risks to experiment and learn about what works and in which context.  \\n12.4.3 Establishing Cooperation between Industry, Academia, and Government  \\nEstablishing linkages between Industry, Academia and Governme nt is a vital issue for leveraging digital \\nand knowledge economy  the predominant view among the of  academic community in Bangladesh is that \\nbasic research done by academia will lead to industrial innovation. Government’s role is perceived to be as \\nfund pro vider for pursuing basic research. On the other hand, Industry expects the academia to deliver \\nhuman resources who can readily start engaging into productive activities. As Bangladesh has been \\npursuing technology import driven economic development, industr y has very negligible learning and \\ninnovation program. On the other hand, linear model of innovation for distilling industrial products from \\nbasic research of academia appears to be highly risky as well as lengthy process of establishing meaningful \\nlinkage  between industry and academia .)  Thus, the academia should be involved in undertaking R&D for \\npredicting, adapting, and innovating next generation digital innovations, often by redesigning existing \\nproducts and processes, for both the Government and the i ndustry. Program activities for linking industry, \\nacademia, and government are shown in Table 12.2.    \\n \\n661 \\n Table 12.2: Program Activities for Linking Industry, Academia, and Government  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Indicators/Targets  Complementary \\nactivities  \\nEncourage industry to pursue redesign of products they \\nare producing now by adding digital technology -based \\nfeatures to products as well as processes  Number of redesign \\nproducts and processes \\nby leveraging digital \\npossibilities, and  \\nMVA as well as servi ce \\nvalue add increased due \\nto it.  \\n \\nNew products with \\ndigital contents are \\nbeing introduced.  \\n \\nPatents and publications \\nare being produced.  \\n \\nRoyalty on patents is \\nbeing earned by the \\nacademic intuitions.  \\n \\nMVA from the \\nexploitations of patents.  Adequate r esearch is \\nneeded to gather \\ninsights and focus on \\nappropriate targets.  \\n \\nPublications, and \\nintellectual property \\nissues to be managed \\nwell for ensuring \\nmeaningful \\ncollaboration  Encourage industry to start producing those products \\nwhere MVA could be incre ased by leveraging digital \\ntechnologies  \\nEncourage industry to pursue innovative solutions around \\ndigital technologies for marginalized groups  \\nFor leveraging digital possibilities, encourage industry to \\nadopt flexible and decentralized production; su pply chain \\nconnectivity, delivery, performance and logistics; agile, \\nadaptive organization  \\nEncourage the industry to pursue circular economy \\nthrough recycling efficient use of resources; \\nremanufacturing, refurbishment and reuse of products and \\ncomponent s; product as service, sharing models, and \\nshifting in consumption patterns  \\nProvide incentives in detecting R&D issues for \\nimplementing above policies and engage academia to \\npursue them.  \\n \\nTo get meaningful results from this partnership, the academia  should be assigned  the role to produce  \\npublishable as well as patentable knowledge, and the industry should be enabled to utilize the knowledge \\ninto profitable ventures.  In absence of this coordinated focus, there is a risk that use of public fund s may \\nnot create a model of private sector driven R&D capacity.  \\n12.4.4 Intellectual Asset and Local and Global Market Centric Start -Up Success Creation and \\nYouth Empowerment  \\nDespite the promise of creating an endless opportunity of growth out of start -ups, as hig h as 90 per cent \\nmortality rate of start -ups is a big concern. Irrespective of the greatness of ideas and strength of the \\nunderlying technology core, every start -up starts the journey in taking an innovative idea to market at loss. \\nIn order to turn this lo ss into profit continued R&D is needed to make the innovation better as well as \\ncheaper. The success strategy should be to focus on continued R&D, creation of portfolio of intellectual \\nassets and properties, and improving quality and lowering cost for crea ting digital innovation success \\nstories. Program activities for increasing start -up success stories are shown in Table 12.3.  \\n    \\n \\n662 \\n Table 12.3: Program Activities for Increasing Start -Up Success Stories  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Indicators/Targets  Comp lementary \\nActivities  \\nProvide incentive in undertaking R&D for \\nproducing patents and expanding intellectual \\nasset base  Patents being filed and received by \\nstart-ups, and integrated into \\nproducts and processes.

Role of IA and patents in start -up \\nvaluation and fund raising.  \\n \\nIt is being observed that digital start -ups scene has been drawing interest of youths. The formation of idea \\naround sm artphone apps and mobile connectivity has been very popular among the youths. But invariably \\nthese ideas do not start the journey in producing profitable revenue, inevitably creating the demand for \\nfund. These youths should be empowered with IA/IP asset ba se to turn those ideas into profitable venture. \\nOtherwise, there is a risk that upon losing money and time in pursuing those ideas through subsidy, they \\nmight end up in high -level failure and frustration.  \\n12.4.5 Leveraging of Redesign Capability for Creat ing Success in High -tech Devices and Innovation  \\nLabour content in manufacturing of high -tech products has been rapidly falling, weakening labour -based \\nmanufacturing value addition (MVA) strategy. On the other hand, advancement of digital technologies is \\noffering the option of redesigning existing high -tech products for offering higher quality at lower cost. This \\nopportunity should be exploited for increasing MVA through ideas of redesign. Moreover, such redesign \\nshould also focus on process redesign as well . Such redesign capability acquisition will also increase the \\nsupply of high -tech productive knowledge. This strategy will also start increasing the high -tech patent \\nportfolio, and opening the opportunity of linking universities with industrial R&D for sup porting innovation \\nneed of the industry.  \\nBangladesh must start building patent portfolio for increasing MVA in high -tech.   It is being observed that \\nglobal ten frontrunner economies account for 90 per cent  of patents and 70 per cent  of exports.  Only 10 \\neconomies together, they account for 91 per cent  of all global patent families in advanced digital \\ntechnologies. Program activities for acquiring and leveraging redesign capability are shown in Table 12.4.  \\n    \\n \\n663 \\n Table 12.4: Programme Activities for Acquiring an d Leveraging Redesign Capability  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Indicators/Targets  Complementary \\nActivities  \\nLink tax and other incentives to MVA through ideas \\nof redesign  MVA growth through \\nredesign  Adequate background \\nresearch should be done \\nto set achievable as \\nwell as attractive value \\nof relevant indicators.

Number of newly \\nintroduced high -tech \\nproducts.   \\nSupport R&D for innovating new produc ts by \\nleveraging the capacity of redesign of existing high -\\ntech products  Number of innovations \\nintroduced in the market  \\n \\n12.4.6 Turning High -tech Parks into Nucleus of Digital, Knowledge and Innovation Economy  \\nThe government of Bangladesh has been workin g on developing specialized industrial parks to support the \\ngrowth of high -tech economy. So far 28 public high -tech and software technology parks  and 12 private \\nSoftware Technology Parks (STPs) are at different phases of development. Firms have already sta rted \\noperation in some of these parks. Moreover, the Government has been also developing a high -tech incubator \\nat CUET. Particularly, in high - tech manufacturing, the journey has begun through labour -based value \\naddition, primarily for assembling of import ed components. But this value addition is extremely low, often \\nless than 10 per cent  of the cost of the finished product. Due to high tax differential reaching as high as \\n57%, producers are succeeding in selling these locally assembled high -tech products a s a strong substitute \\nto imported ones. But such low value addition is neither rewarding for the country, nor cost -competitive \\nfor export. Due to low value addition, even after enjoying 10% cash incentive, producers are failing to make \\nthese locally assemb led high -tech products competitive in the export market. In order to increase the value \\naddition, moving to component manufacturing often does not offer attractive value proposition. Due to \\nscale, scope, and IP effects, often it is cheaper to import most o f the high -tech components than to \\nmanufacture them locally. To address this issue, the strategy should be linking high -tech parks with \\nuniversities, research establishments, intermediate goods and service providers, and start -up initiatives \\nmaking high -tech parks as the nucleus of innovation economy of Bangladesh. For example, semiconductor \\ndesign service providers can offer services to high -tech product firms to redesign their products for adding \\nvalue through ideas, in addition to labour. Table 12.5 show s program activities for turning high -tech parks \\ninto nucleus of innovation.   \\n    \\n \\n664 \\n Table 12.5: Programme Activities for Turning High -tech Parks into Nucleus of Innovation  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Indicators/Targets  \\nProvide incentives to ecosystem to  provide knowledge inputs to \\nhigh-tech manufacture firms  Value add through collaboration  \\nEncourage high -tech product assemblers to redesign their \\nproducts through sourcing of ideas and design services locally  Number of products being redesigned \\nand patent s filed  \\nSupport start -ups to innovate high -tech products and locate into \\nhigh-tech parks  Number of start -ups move to high -tech \\nparks  \\nOffer R&D supports to universities to undertake redesign \\nassignments from high -tech firms  R&D projects, patents, publica tions  \\nSupport collaborative projects between firms operating in high -\\ntech parks, and university -based incubators  Number of collaborations  \\nSupport the collaboration between firms operating in high -tech \\nparks, ICT industry, universities, and line ministrie s so that local \\nindustry can succeed in innovating and manufacturing needed \\ninnovations to support mission need of respective line ministries  Number of line ministries involved and \\ntheir implications on innovation, local \\nproduction and procurement  \\nEncoura ge local and foreign companies to manufacture digital \\ndevices and its backward linkage products in Bangladeshi High -\\nTech Parks.

Number of Companies get fina ncial \\nsupport and low -cost space in Hi -Tech \\nParks  \\n \\nLike other developing countries, Bangladesh faces the challenge of developing a productive knowledge \\nbase, primarily in the technology stack that is underpinning the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) whi le \\nleveraging innovation economy. While innovating and making complex products may be a far -fetched \\ndream, Bangladesh needs to keep acquiring superior productive knowledge so that the country\\'s youths can \\nparticipate in the emerging global labour market. I n the era of 4IR, skill demands will progressively centre \\non the development of Artificially Intelligent (AI) components.  \\nIt is widely acknowledged that increased investment in conventional educational activities will not lead to \\nthe acquisition of higher -level productive knowledge. Rather, learning by working in processes tied to \\ndeveloping complex products appears to be the best option for acquiring the essential skills. Such reality \\noften poses a chicken & egg problem and finding an entry point to break the impasse is critical. Among \\nother options, this is why the immense potential of acquiring productive AI knowledge by harnessing \\npossibilities like remote sensing offered by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or software intensive \\ninnovations for augmenting  labour in farming and healthcare can be considered.  Program activities for \\ncreating productive knowledge are shown in Table 12.6.  \\n    \\n \\n665 \\n Table 12.6: Programme Activities for Creating Productive Knowledge  \\nPolicies and Programme Activities  Outcomes  \\nEstablish l abs focusing on 4IR technologies and \\ncollaborative platforms, especially Public -Private \\nPartnerships (PPP), to create awareness and \\nunderstanding, foster the adoption of new \\ntechnologies, support adaptation and further \\nadvancement, developing intellectual assets, and \\nfacilitate the transfer of knowledge.  1. Real-life awareness of 4IR possibilities in \\ndifferent sectors  \\n2. R&D supports will facilitate start -ups in taking \\ntheir ideas to market  \\n3. Supply of 4IR productive knowledge will \\nincrease  \\n4. IT firms will make good  use of the facility to \\nundertake 4IR R&D  \\nTo create the demand and supply capacities of 4IR \\ninnovations, focus should be on developing sector \\nspecific 4IR Use Cases and documenting global best \\npractices, and promoting as well as supporting their \\ndevelopme nt, adoption, and diffusion.  Clarity of business benefits out of 4IR use cases and \\nglobal best practices will lead to strengthening both \\nsupply and demand of local 4IR innovation market.  \\n \\n12.4.7 ICT for Greater Transparency, Good Governance, and Service D elivery  \\nBangladesh has already made progress in ICT usages in public service delivery (Table 12 7). This progress \\nshould be accelerated by capitalizing new technology opportunities, including data analytics. Box 12.1 \\nshows areas where further progress needs to be made.  \\nTable 12. 7: Evolution of Bangladesh’s e -Government Development Stages  \\nFocused Area  e-Government Development Stages Over Three Major Periods  \\nTill 2018  2020 -2025  2031 -2041  \\nPosition in E -Government Development Index (EGDI)  \\nprepared by Depar tment of Economic and Social Affairs of United Nations  \\nIndicator  Score  \\n(0-1) Rank  \\n/193 Score  \\n(0-1) Rank  \\n/93 Score  \\n(0-1) Rank  \\n/93 \\nE-Government Development \\nIndex (EGDI)  0.4862  115 0.65 80 0.74 40 \\nOnline Service Component  0.7847  NA 0.86 NA 0.90 NA \\nTelecomm: Infrastructure  \\nComponent  0.1976  NA 0.54 NA 0.7 NA \\nHuman Capital Component  0.4763  NA 0.73 NA 0.85 NA \\n \\n    \\n \\n666 \\n  \\nBox 12.1 : Areas for Further Improvement for ICT  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate  skilled resources: this has been observed time and time again as the single largest b arrier.  \\nSkill gaps exist at multiple levels in agencies and among citizens, including:  \\n− Basic ICT and smartphone literacy of citizens, particularly at senior level  \\n− Digital service design and implementation  \\n− Business process transformation   \\n− Management of data centres and ICT systems in a secured manner  \\n− Integration, interoperability and information exchange between internal and external systems  \\n− Strategic ICT management and foresight.  \\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate  impact for citizens:  few digital services have yet achieved high levels of take -up, and \\ntypically run alongside the existing paper -based systems (adding cost and complexity to service delivery \\nwhile benefiting only some users of the services).  \\n\\uf0b7 ICT duplication: most of the information systems across government agen cies are running on disparate \\ndata centres, ICT architectures and software development platforms, with duplicated requirements and \\ninvestments.  \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of interoperability: systems have largely been developed in isolation from each other, so are \\ndifficult to  integrate.  Awareness of the National Enterprise Architecture and the E -Government \\nInteroperability Framework is low, and people who are aware of them are unsure about the practical \\nimplementations for their Ministries.  \\n\\uf0b7 Insufficient capacity with existin g shared services: where BCC already offers shared ICT services ( e.g \\nhosting in the national data  centre, computer emergency incident response), these services are welcomed \\nbut we lack capacity to meet it in full.  \\n\\uf0b7 Data Protection, Privacy and Cyber securi ty: following the recently experienced cyber security  \\nchallenges at Bangladesh Bank, agencies increasingly appreciate the important need to improve the \\nsecurity of their digital government systems to protect the public administration from continual and \\nevolving cyber threats, but lack skills, processes and resources to do so.  \\n \\n12.4.8 Ensuring Equitable and Fair Share of Bangladesh in Global Digital Value Chain  \\nGiven the regulatory weaknesses of Bangladesh and lack of international collaboration in dealing with \\nantitrust and data privacy issues, the progression of digitization has been leading to gradual taking over of \\nlocal businesses by global ones. Moreover, breach of data privacy is making citizens vulnerable to \\nmanipulation, discrimination, and harassme nt, consequently leading to increasing inequality among \\ncountries and fellow human beings.   \\nFor example, Bangladesh\\'s total advertisement market size is worth US$ 150 million. It\\'s being reported \\nthat companies in Bangladesh are spending nearly US$ 100 mil lion every year for digital marketing on the \\nplatforms of Facebook and Google to reach their target audience. The rapid proliferation of smartphones, \\nfrequent visits of potential customers to web sites containing targeted contents, and increasing \\nsophistic ation of algorithms have made online advertising far more effective than conventional platforms \\nlike TVs or billboards. Unlike the past, the online advertising market is virtually monopolized by two global \\nplayers: Google and Facebook. Such monopolization raises important questions. How did they succeed? \\nWith high market shares, are these companies abusing market power throttling competition and unfairly \\ntreating users? How are different countries responding to concerns pertaining to market power, antitrust , \\nand other competition issues?    \\n \\n667 \\n On the other hand, Bangladesh’s recent progress in ICT and digital Bangladesh is primarily driven by public \\nexpenditure, reaching above BDT 15,000 crore. The recent progress of smartphone assembling does not \\nbring much chan ge either, as local value addition is less than 10%. As labour based value addition in digital \\ndevices and software innovations is as low as 10%, firms and countries having strong portfolio of patented \\nideas are dominating value addition in international t rade of digital products. According to recent study of \\nUNIDO, “Ten frontrunner economies account for 91 per cent  of patents, 70 per cent  of exports and 46 per \\ncent of imports of new technologies.” With virtually no patent portfolio in digital technologies,  \\nBangladesh’s digital agenda is primarily import driven. Bangladesh must take steps to reverse this situation. \\nSuggested programme activities are shown in Table 12.8.  \\nTable 12.8: Programme Activities for Increasing Fair Share of Bangladesh  \\nPolicy and Progr amme Activities  Outcomes  \\nTo protect citizens in the digital space, update data \\nprotection regulation, along the line of EU’s General \\nData Protection Regulation.  \\n Measures are taken to safeguard data of citizens, \\ncorporates, and the Government. Legal steps  are \\nbeing taken against violations.  \\nAddress regulatory weaknesses and strengthen \\ninternational collaboration in dealing with antitrust and \\ndata privacy issues  \\n.  Global players are prevented from anti -competitive \\nbehaviour, and local firms are given scop e to grow \\nin digital space.   \\nInvest in R&D in developing patent portfolio in digital \\ntechnology space.  \\n  Bangladeshi firms start upgrading their value \\naddition capacity by leveraging patents ideas.  \\nPromote local firms in the global market  Branding Bang ladesh as an ICT destination for \\nhardware, software and BPO  \\n \\n \\n12.4.9  Harnessing ICT for Poverty Reduction  \\nDigital financial services (DFS) have revolutionised the delivery of financial services by cutting down \\ntransaction costs while at the same time reac hing out to various poor and marginalised groups who have \\nlong been excluded from the formal financial sector. Bangladesh has also made use of mobile financial \\nservices in reaching out to the poor and vulnerable groups with social security benefit payment.   The rapid \\ngrowth of mobile cellular phone usages in Bangladesh in conjunction with the regulatory changes allowing \\nbanks to establish subsidiaries offering financial services through mobile phones has made it possible for \\nmobile financial services (MFS) to become an important means of promoting financial inclusion. Another \\nbig policy push for promoting financial inclusivity through DFS was the reform initiative undertaken to \\ntransfer the government to person (G2P) payments for social security schemes dire ctly to beneficiaries \\nusing either their bank or MFS accounts.   \\nHowever, there are important ways that the 8FYP will make the DFS/MFS system more effective in \\nachieving financial inclusion of the poor and marginalized groups. These include: includes among st others, \\nstrengthening the national identification database, improving the payments infrastructure including the \\nestablishment of the interoperability amongst digital financial service providers, promoting innovations to \\nmake DFS services more supportive  of growth of small business holders, and dealing with growing gender \\ndisparity in financial inclusion. In particular, the 8FYP will strive to:    \\n \\n668 \\n  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce gender disparity in financial inclusion:  Despite the remarkable progress achieved over the \\npast decade,  the growing gender gap (from 11 percentage points in 2011 to 29 percentage points in \\n2017) in financial inclusion is a concern. Although there are efforts to improve the situation through \\nthe digitization of G2P in largest transfer schemes that target rur al, poor, marginal, and vulnerable \\nwomen, there exist significant room for making the overall DFS architecture more gender inclusive. \\nThis includes, amongst others, expanding the existing product space of female DFS users.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen national identificat ion (NID) database:  The national identification (NID) database – \\noriginally initiated for issuing voters’ ID – currently registering about 110 million adult citizens \\nhas been made available for establishing an electronic know your customer (e -KYC) ID verif ication \\nsystem, boosting the expansion of DFS through fast customer on boarding  and reduced cost in the \\nprocess. This is already playing an important role for mobile financial inclusion. However, 8 per \\ncent of the adult population is reported to be not in the NID database. When the non -adult \\npopulation group is considered, 32 per cent of Bangladeshi citizens do not have a digital ID. \\nAchieving a full ID coverage of the population can be particularly helpful for women, poor and \\nvulnerable groups who are more  likely to be outside of the formal financial system and are in need \\nof various social security support. Upgrading of the NID database would also include amending or \\nupdating any personal information as it has been reported that wrong dates of birth have m ade many \\nelderly citizens ineligible for such social security benefits as old age allowances.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Develop a single registry of beneficiaries:  One critical challenge confronting Bangladesh’s social \\nprotection system is to develop a single social registry of beneficiaries drawing on from separate \\ndatabases maintained by various ministries. T he use of digital ID of individual beneficiaries and \\nelectronic database of beneficiaries can help establish a robust single registry of social security \\nbeneficiaries.     \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Full digitisation of G2P payments:   An important priority for the 8th plan would be to achieve the \\ncomplete digitalisation of the G2P payment system, linking the beneficiary targeting of social \\nsecurity/enrolment to NID along with operationalizing  the Nati onal Household Database for \\naddressing exclusion and inclusion errors in beneficiary selection.  \\n12.4.1 0 Leveraging  Digital Economy for Attaining SDGs  \\nIt’s well accepted that technology has a key role to play to make progress in attaining SDGs. Technology,  \\nparticularly digital technology stack driving 4IR comprising of more than a dozen frontier technologies, \\nstarting from AI to block chain , has the potential to improve both effectiveness and efficiency of resource \\nutilization, service delivery, monitoring progress, and establishing cooperative partnerships. It’s obvious \\nthat the potential of digital technologies on each goal and also target will vary. How does the qualitative \\nobservation on likely relative potential (low, medium and high) of advanced digita l technology stack up on \\nattaining each of the 169 targets pertaining to 17 SGDs? Among them, 126 are targets for attaining SDGs \\nand 43 are means of action, but each of them is amenable to get support from digital technology stack. \\nSome example of digital opportunities is shown in Tables 12.9 and 12.10.    \\n \\n669 \\n Table 12.9: Example of Digital Innovations for Attaining SDGs  \\nRelated SDG Targets  Digital Innovation Potentials  \\nSDG 2.4 Ensure sustainable food production \\nsystem  \\nSDG 12.3 Halve per capita global food waste  \\nat the retail and consumer levels and reduce \\nfood losses along production and supply \\nchains, including post -harvest losses  Reduce food wastage through (i) optimal harvesting, (ii) \\nprecision processing, storage, packaging and transportation, \\n(iii) tracking  the supply chain, (iv) optimal retailing.    \\nSupply and demand optimization at the retail level through \\nimproved prediction  \\nSDG 2.3 Double the food productivity  \\nSDG 2.4 Ensure sustainable food production \\nsystem  2.1 UAV based soil fertility and crop healt h mapping, and \\nprecisely distributing inputs like fertilizer, pesticide, and \\nwater;  \\nWastage of farming inputs could be reduced and yield of \\nfarming outputs could be improved.  \\n \\nTable 12.10: Programme Activities for Leveraging Digital Technologies for SDGs  \\nPolices and Programme Activities  Outcomes  \\nFor each target of SDGs, support is needed to conduct \\ntechnology specific investigation, to locate realizable \\npotential and designing intervention to turn it into results \\ntowards attaining SDGs.

Well -coordinated, synergistic interventions  \\nEngage industry through associations, and provide R&D \\nsupports to link universities and R&D facilities to industry \\nfocus innovations  Products and processes are being redesigned to \\nminimize material and energy  need, and \\nreduce waste  \\n \\n12.4.11 Digital Economy for Leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution  \\nIn a recent report ( A2i, 2019 ), it has been predicted that in five major sectors of Bangladesh, 5.5 million \\npeople will likely loss jobs by 2041. Such predictio n is in parallel with the global scenario of job loss, as \\npredicted by Frey, C. B., and Osborne, M. (2013). On the other hand, there are also counter arguments. \\nThere has been also strong belief that like in the past, technology led productivity growth wil l lead to both \\neconomic and labour demand growth. But there is no denying that technology creates job polarization \\neffect. Along with the creation of new tasks, technology invariably delegates tasks from human to machines, \\ncreating non -uniform effect on in dividuals, firms, industries, and countries, which is commonly known as \\njob polarization. In this globally connected economy, such reality of technology implications demands clear \\nunderstanding about likely implications on labour demand and skill transform ation, and required responses \\nfrom education and training institutions to address them. Moreover, as scale, scope and speed of the effect \\nof technology in the age of 4IR will be far deeper than other three revolutions, the importance of predicting \\nand taki ng countervailing measures are far more important than ever before. Relevant observations and \\nrecommendations are provided in Table 12. 11   \\n \\n670 \\n Table 12. 11: Leveraging Digital Possibilities for Coping up and Leveraging 4IR  \\nSl Observations  Strategic Recommendatio ns \\n1 Technology progression will lead to (i) automation \\nof tasks, (ii) creation of new tasks, and (iii) \\nredefinition of remaining tasks. As a result, task \\ncontent production will keep experiencing \\ntransformation . Such dynamics creating polarizing \\neffect h as non -uniform effect on types of tasks as \\nwell as gender.  In target industries, task level analysis of \\noccupations should be performed, and projection \\nshould be made about the task content  \\ntransf ormation based on likely implications of each \\nof the technol ogies underpinning 4IR.   \\n2 The improvements of technology, the increasing use \\nof the internet and the need for people to learn \\nbeyond any restriction have led to a proliferation of \\nDigital Learning. A digital centre  of excellence for \\nteaching and learnin g through online media can be a \\ncentre  of education in coming days.  Steps should be taken to establish a Virtual \\nUniversity.   \\n3 Skill requirement in performing tasks will keep \\nchanging due to transformation of task content \\nproduction. For example, once d igital printing is \\nintroduced, task content in production in the printing \\ndepartment of RMG value chain changes.  Training need for up skilling should be assessed \\nbased on likely transformation of task content \\nproduction. Moreover, special emphasis should be \\ngiven to up skilling female workers, as they are \\nworse sufferer to automation.  \\n4 Sharpening of innate capabilities (including soft \\nskills) will increase the performance of labour in \\nexecuting low -level manual tasks. As a result, \\ntechnology developer w ill find it harder to automate \\nthose tasks, leading to longer shelf life of low skilled \\nlabour.   At the school level, measures should be taken to \\nenhance innate capabilities and soft skills of \\nstudents. Moreover, existing labour force should \\nalso be given  training to enhance innate capabilities, \\nalong with soft skills.   \\n5 In both goods and services, new features will be \\nadded for leveraging technologies driving 4IR. As a \\nresult, new tasks will be required to perform in \\nproducing those additional features . For example, \\nAR/VR based features could be introduced to \\nexpand tour guidance features in hospitality and \\ntourism industry.  Both existing and new labour force should be given \\ntraining in performing those tasks in producing 4IR \\ntechnology -based features.  Some of these likely \\nfeatures are embedded electronics in RMG \\nproducts, or VR/AR based guidance to tourists, or \\nserving customized food to guests using modern \\ncooking tools and methods.     \\n6 Depend on the progression of technologies \\nunderpinning the 4IR  transformation of task content \\nproduction will take place, demanding training need \\nfor up skilling.  Technology assessment and forecasting should be \\ntaken into consideration to predict task content \\nproduction transformation for assessing the up -\\nskilling t raining need.  \\n7 Skill demand depends not only on the degree of \\nautomation, but also on the products, which firms, \\nindustries, and country as a whole produce. In \\nadding to automating existing tasks, 4IR technology \\nstack is also opening opportunity of intro ducing \\nadditional tasks, such as remote service delivery.  Measures should be taken to introduce production \\nof additional products for the purpose of both \\nexport and import substitution, particularly by \\nleveraging 4IR (e.g., remote supervision of It’s and \\nservice delivery in collaboration with Robots) so \\nthat the volume of task supply increases.    \\n \\n671 \\n Sl Observations  Strategic Recommendatio ns \\n8 It’s estimated that almost 2 million job seekers are \\nentering the labour market of Bangladesh. Among \\nthem as high as 50 per cent  of them are leaving the \\ncountry.   In determining skill development need, \\ntransformation of job content production should \\nalso take into consideration of nature of jobs in \\nwhich Bangladeshi expatriates will be likely \\nengaging.  \\n9 IR4.0 technology stack supports innovation, in both \\nproduc ts and process levels, creating new tasks. For \\nexample, UAV based fertility and crop health \\nmapping, and discharging of inputs in a precise \\nmanner.  Innovation prediction should be made and \\nfacilitation should be provided, consequentially \\nincreasing the ta sk supply. Skill development \\ntraining should be provided for performing those \\nnewly introduced tasks.  \\n10 Most of the studies, including the one conducted by \\na2i in partnership with ILO, appear to be at the \\noccupation level, giving emphasis on job loss. S uch \\nstudies do not focus on the likely transformation of \\ntask content production due to progression of 4IR.  \\nAs a result, such studies do not provide adequate \\nclarity on training need assessment for skill \\ndevelopment.  Exiting studies should be complemente d with \\nfollow up detailed tasks level investigation spelling \\nout the automation of tasks, change of interface of \\nremaining tasks, introduction of new tasks for \\nadopting automation, and also introduction of new \\ntasks due to addition of product features.     \\n11 Due to rapid progression of IR4.0 technology stack, \\ntask content production will keep changing, \\nconsequentially demanding constant upgrading of \\nskill level.   Lifelong learning attitude and skill should be \\ndeveloped in both existing labour force and f uture \\njob seekers. Developing skill of learning from on -\\nline resources is an example of building lifelong \\nlearning skill.  \\n \\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution has been a vital issue. The continued progression of the underlying \\ntechnologies has been unfoldin g the 4IR. In order to cope up the threat and leverage opportunities, \\nunderlying technologies need to be monitored, implications should be assessed, HR development needs to \\nbe determined, innovation opportunities need to be identified, and appropriate inte rventions must be taken.  \\n12.4.12 Intensifying Effectiveness and Efficiency, and Encouraging Private Investment  \\nDuring the tenure of 7FYP, public investment has been dominating the investment scenario in the ICT \\nsector and Digital Bangladesh program. It’s worth noting that over a span of four years, public expenditure \\nin the ICT sector jumped from around Taka 4,000 crores to over Taka 15,000 cores. It appears that private \\ninvestment has not kept pace with this growth of public investment.  Some of the obser vations in \\nintensifying private investments in different segments of the ICT sector are as follows:  \\n(a) International connectivity, Domestic Transmission, Access network and Internet service : There \\nhas been significant progress in international connectivit y. Competition between private operators and state -\\nowned submarine cable operators has reduced the wholesale price of international bandwidth. But such \\nwholesale price fall is not reflected in proportionate price reduction of internet bandwidth at the user’s end. \\nOne of the factors is domestic transmission network. There has been very weak or no competition in this \\nsegment. Government’s aggressive investment to strengthen this segment by linking all unions is not being   \\n \\n672 \\n complemented by private investment. Ra ther NTTN operators have become contactors to Government’s \\nprojects. As a result, supply driven competition strategy has not been in action . On the other hand, due to \\nvirtual monopoly in the access network, there has been no aggressive investment for upgra ding technology \\nand increasing efficiency. Despite the progress in mobile centric Internet connectivity, and public \\ninvestment, the cost and quality of Internet connection is still a major concern. To address it, measures \\nshould be taken to intensify compe tition of private investment as opposed to pumping more public fund.         \\n(b) Cloud Infrastructure : Foreign providers are dominating Bangladesh’s cloud service market. These \\nproviders neither have establishment in Bangladesh, nor do they offer legally d efendable acceptable SLA \\nto individuals and firms of Bangladesh. Measures should be taken to address data privacy and SLA \\npertaining to global cloud service. To complement Government’s investment in Tier 4 data centre, there \\nhas not been proportionate priv ate investment to develop local cloud platforms. Policy measures should be \\ntaken during the 8FYP to stimulate private investment in setting up cloud platforms.      \\n(c) Software : Despite the expansion of computer science and engineering education, and publ ic funded \\ntraining programmes , there has been very limited private investment to expand the software segment of the \\nICT industry.  To exploit the software segment further, strategic focus should be on blending of science \\nwith software to innovate solutions  in addressing yield, quality and wastage in critical areas of the society.  \\n(d) High -tech manufacturing : It’s being reported that as high as 60% smartphone being sold in \\nBangladesh are now locally assembled. Basically, very low tax on components and high tax on finished \\nproducts (as high as 57%) has created high tax differential in favour of local assembling. But labour based \\nlocal value addition in this progress is very low. As a result, both job creation and private investment are \\nextremely low. Conventi onal strategy of manufacturing components to progress along the value chain does \\nnot address this either. The focus should be on R&D for adding value through ideas of redesign. The 8FYP \\nshould take measures to make progress along this line. Tax and other b enefits could be linked to the progress \\nof acquiring patents and using them in redesigning products as well as processes for increasing the quality \\nand reducing the cost. The focus should be on value addition and high -paying job creation as opposed to \\nvolume of assembling outputs.      \\n(e) e-Commerce : Despite the recent growth of this segment, there has been ample scope of increasing the \\neffectiveness and efficiency for encouraging private investment. During the 8FYP , development of \\ninteroperable smart logi stics and warehouses could be supported to grow to scale up e -commerce, \\nparticularly in the rural areas. Literacy for smartphone -based service consumption and transaction, and \\ndigital payment should also be addressed. Incentives could be given for digital payment as opposed to \\nmaking cash payment.       \\n(f) Business process outsourcing : Despite high wage differential in favour of Bangladesh, export revenue \\nin the BPO yet to show significant growth. The growth of mobile phone and Internet penetration has ope ned \\nthe opportunity of offering diverse services including customer care over the mobile phones. Policy and \\nregulatory measure could be taken to encourage outsourcing customer care and back office services to \\ndevelop local expertise and capacity for scalin g up the export revenue.    \\n    \\n \\n673 \\n (g) Freelancing : Despite the participation of large number of youths, as high as 500,000, the revenue from \\nthe segment is insignificant. It is learned that only a small fraction of these freelancers is generating \\nattractive re venue from marketplace. As most of the freelancers are failing to earn adequate revenue, there \\nhas been declining trend in active freelancing population in Bangladesh. To increase per person revenue, \\nthe focus should be on delivering high -value professiona l services. For exploiting this potential, market -\\noriented skill development should get focus. Cross boarder payment appears to be a major obstacle for their \\ngrowth. Research finds that top performing freelancers could be assisted to scale up their success es in \\ncreating firms.  Some of the interventions could be in setting up accelerators and providing management \\nsupport for product development.  \\n(h) Start -ups and venture capital financing : Bangladesh’s success of attracting less than $100 million \\nventure ca pital finance is insignificant India’s record of raising over $14 billion. A large number of \\ninternational VCs poured such a huge risk capital to India’s start -ups. The strategy of attracting increasing \\nforeign VC funds in Bangladesh’s start -ups should inc lude packaging start -ups led innovation opportunities \\nand promoting them, supporting R&D and encouraging start -ups to develop intellectual property strategy, \\nand easing the operation of VCs in Bangladesh. It’s worth of noting that international VC financin g for \\nexploiting digital innovation opportunities through start -ups could be a vital financing strategy for meeting \\nSDGs and leveraging 4IR out of local innovation opportunities.      \\n12.4.1 3 Developing National Innovation System for Leveraging Knowledge E conomy  \\nThe leveraging of digital opportunities and creating knowledge economy is quite different than \\nBangladesh’s track record of import substitution and RMG export. The culture of learning and pursuing the \\njourney of perfection is quite different than la bour-based manufacture value addition. It appears that \\nBangladesh needs to make significant progress to nurture conducive culture to leverage knowledge \\neconomy in the digital age. Lessons from other countries, particularly of Japan, are useful in this rega rd. \\nThe culture of pursuing a relentless journey of chasing endless perfection out of scientific discoveries and \\ntechnological inventions appears to be at the core of profiting from innovative ideas. Such cultural values \\ngrow among individuals through meti culous nurturing in families, schools, workplaces, and society as a \\nwhole. And the state plays a vital role in patronizing this precious capability underpinning the innovation \\neconomy. In addition to making progress in conventional indicators, it\\'s time to  have a serious focus on \\nnurturing the culture of pursuing a persistent journey of endless perfection for offering better quality \\nproducts at lower cost to succeed in profiting from ideas.  \\nNational innovation system:  In building a knowledge economy as a ke y development priority for \\nBangladesh, sponsoring the importance of knowledge and technology diffusion for the promotion of \\nknowledge networks and “national innovation system” should be given strategic focus. In developing the \\nnational innovation system dr iving economic growth of Bangladesh should draw lesson from other \\ncountries such as Korea, India, and Taiwan. Summary of the lesson from Korea is shown in Box 12.2.     \\n \\n674 \\n  \\nICT Division  will play a crucial  role in this regard.  It will be that of an innovation  intermediary  and \\nknowledge  leader  that will spearhead  the country’s  ability  to spot,  understand  and integrate  new \\ndevelopment  approaches,  work  to strengthen  institutional  linkages  across  the whole -of-government  and \\nwhole -of-society,  and play a catalytic  role in fostering  inclusive,  citizen -centric  governance  and societal  \\ninnovation  in Banglade sh.  In doing  so, the ICT Division  will accelerate  a national  innovation  ecosystem  \\nthat empowers  individual  citizens  and society  as a whole  to transform  innovative  ideas into practical  \\nsolutions  that reach  the scale  necessary  to achieve  the SDGs  and realize  Vision  2041  of emerging  as a \\nprosperous,  developed  and poverty -free nation.  \\n12.4.1 4 Harnessing the power of ICT for revival from the effect of COVID 19 and for adapta bility to \\nshocks arising from health crisis, natural disaster, climate change, or global shift in \\ncompetitive landscape  \\nAddressing  sector  specific  challenges  and opportunities:  While  COVID -19 has revealed  the fault lines  \\nin our systems,  it has also provid ed an opportunity  to define  blind  spots,  identify  systemic  barriers  and \\nopportunities  for growth.  COVID -19 challenges  have  triggered  actions  which,  if leveraged,  can take \\nBangladesh  to the next level  of digitization  with the agenda  of Made  in Bangladesh.  The challenges  posed  \\nby COVID -19 in key sectors  and the relevant  ICT led strategies  are summarized  below:  \\nFinancial  Inclusion:  The COVID -19 pandemic  and subsequent  lockdowns  and social  distancing  \\nrequirements  are exacerbating  the long existing  problem  of lack of access  to finance.  Despite  the strong  \\nefforts  in the last few years  to propel  financial  inclusion,  inadequate  interaction  among  banks,  NBFIs,  MFIs,  \\nMFS  and DFS platforms,  and mobile  phone  operators  regarding  data sharing  has held back the inclusion  of \\nthe bottom  of the pyramid  citizens  into financial  channels.  This has prevented  the most  vulnerable  \\npopulations  from  availing  financial  support  during  the current  pandemic.  Leveraging  learning’s  from  best \\npractices  globally,  the ICT Division  proposes  the following  short -term interventions:  a) promote  \\ninteroperability  to speed  up financial  inclusion  by 10 times  by 2021;  b) offer  direct  incentives  for availing  \\nfinancial  services  till mid-2021;  c) collaborate  with MFIs  and mobile  operators  to offer  digital  credit score  \\nfor SMEs  to promote  4 times  growth;  d) devise  a master  plan for a digital  economy  to secure  to secure  a \\nresilient  financial  ecosystem;  e) develop  regulatory  sandbox  by the Bangladesh  Bank  to allow  pilot testing  \\nbefore  approval  of a policy  from  the end of 2020.   \\nStart -up Ecosystem:  Start -ups have  been a driving  force  behind  innovation  and economic  progress,  \\nplaying  an instrumental  role in the Vision  2021  and Digital  Bangladesh  Agenda,  employing  1.5 million  \\npeople,  and attracting  over $ 200 million  in international  venture  capital  funds.  However,  lack of access  to Box 12.2:  Lesson for building National Innovation System for Leveraging Knowledge Economy  \\nKorea’s process innovation leading to incremental improvement of p roducts appears to be role model for \\nBangladesh. Korea’s strategy of demonstrating the benefit of R&D in driving industrial competitiveness \\nthrough Government funded research institution played a key role in encouraging private sector to set up \\ncorporate R &D labs. To leverage this progress, Korea carefully developed university centric research \\ncapacity and linked them with private sector R&D labs and Government’s research institution. Such \\nstrategy appears to be very suitable for Bangladesh in developing th e national innovation system. As a \\nresult, although Koreas R&D spending has reached over 4.3% of GDP by 2015, but Industry shares almost \\n90% of this R&D investment. Moreover, linking of university is addressing human resource issue.    \\n \\n675 \\n funding,  improper  knowledge  of cash flow management,  lack of comprehensive  government  support,  and \\nlegal  and regulatory  challenges  hinder  this sector.  COVID -19 crisis  severely  impacted  the ecosystem  – a \\nsurvey  of over 160 start-ups in April  2020  found  a 50% drop in revenue  generation.   The ICT Division  \\nproposes  the following  immediate  to short -term interventions:  a) emergency  allocation  of BDT  150 crore  \\nstart-up funds  for 150 prominent  start-ups in the form  of equity/quasi -equity  by 2020;  b) launch  fund of \\nfunds  to attract  domestic/foreign  capital  market  investments  by 2021;  c) launch  Start -up Assistance  program  \\nto provide  in-kind benefits  to minimize  operation  costs  till mid-2021;  d) enact  procurement  law “Made  in \\nBangladesh”  to mandate  corporations  to source  from  start-ups and incentivizing  angel  investors  to increase  \\noverall  liquidity  by 2021;  and, e) set-up Invest  Bangladesh  as a holistic  information  platform  for start-ups \\nby 2025.  \\nDigita l Commerce:  Since  2013 -14, the digital  commerce  landscape  experienced  remarkable  growth.  Over  \\n102 million  internet  users  are spearheading  digital  literacy  and online  spending.  The sector  is expected  to \\nequal  at TK 70 billion  ($ 826 million)  by 2021.  The COVID-19 outbreak  severely  disrupted  this sector;  \\ncompanies  outlined  a loss of TK 666 core ($ 78.6 million),  where  f-commerce  and non-essential  businesses  \\nsuffering  the most.  Lack  of technological  adoption  and platform  services  for the SME  sector,  limited  \\nawareness  and exposure  to the utilities  of e-commerce,  knowledge  gaps,  and lack of conducive  tax and \\nVAT  policies  for digital  commerce  are refraining  the growth  of the sector  and lowering  the potential  for \\nfurther  investments.  The ICT Division  proposes  the following  immediate  short -term interventions:  a) \\ndevelop  a COVID -19 code  of conduct  along  with e-commerce  policy  to promote  hyper  local  e-commerce  \\nfor the last mile;  b) reform  taxation  for online  shopping  and digital  advertising  by 2020;  c) launch  assisted  \\ne-commerce  service  for easier  adoption  of online  shopping  practices;  d) ensure  affordable  mobile  internet  \\nprices  in collaboration  with BRTC;  and, e) promote  existing  digital  platform  start-ups and services,  and \\nintroduce  new ones for SMEs  for digital  trans formation  by end of 2021.   \\nEducation:  Education  institutions  in Bangladesh  are safe havens  for learning,  social  protection  and health,  \\nnutrition,  and psychological  support  to young  minds.  COVID -19 pandemic  put 16 million  students  at risk; \\nsession  jams and high dropout  rates are resulting  in multitude  of obstacles  to students  in the secondary,  \\nhigher  secondary,  SSC examinees,  HSC  candidates  and university  students.  The crisis  can potentially  \\nincrease  child  labour,  underage  marriage  (especially  of girls),  increased  anti-social/illegal  activities,  and \\nimpact  future  income  generation.  Lack  of a national  edu-tech agenda  further  impacts  the sector  –students  \\nare disconnected  due to lack of connectivity/affordability.  Only  few urban  and semi -urban  institutions  have  \\nmoved  to online  classes,  while  majority  of nationwide  student  remain  excluded.  The ICT Division  proposes  \\nthe following  immediate  and short -term interventions:  a) policies  to facilitate  the growth  of blended  \\nlearning  before  2021;  b) development  of multi -sectoral participation  and infrastructure  for virtual  schooling  \\nbefore  end of 2020;  c) develop  IT infrastructure  and provide  incentives  to support  tech-based  learning  \\nthrough  public -private  partnerships  by 2021;  d) encourage  group  education  methods  in rural areas; and e) \\nenable  private  sector  investments  to ensure  improved  access  to education  for all by 2030.  \\nSupply -chain:  The COVID -19 crisis  and subsequent  lockdown/restrictions  on movement  is leading  to the \\nsupply -chain  disruption  like stockouts,  stockpiling,  and price  inflation  of essential  goods.  Smallholder  \\nfarmers  are failing  to buy agro-inputs  from  intermediaries,  while  FMCG  distributions  are disrupted  due to \\nabsence  of digitized  inventory  management  issues.  A loss of $16 million  is predicted  due to China ’s \\nslowdown  through  global  value  chains,  where  94% of the loss is expected  to be borne  by the leather  \\nindustry.  Increasing  mobile  data costs  are making  it more  difficult  for people  belonging  to the lower  income    \\n \\n676 \\n groups  to reap the benefits  of using  mobile  applications  to avail  digital  services  such as - agro-based  app, \\nlogistics  app, and e-commerce  platforms.  The ICT Division  proposes  the following  immediate  to short -\\nterm interventions:  a) empowering  marginal  farmers  to strengthen  agro supply -chain;  b) fully  digitizing  \\ninventory  management  to make  FMCG  supply  more  efficient  and resilient;  c) on boarding  policymakers  to \\nlower  the cost of mobile  internet  packages  by 2020;  d) popularize  the use of smartphones  in rural areas;  \\nand, e) policy  reform  to modify  the law of lending  fleets  by corporates  within  2020.  \\nEmployment  and Skills:  Bangladesh  generated  1.15 million  jobs per year over the past decade.  However,  \\nthe growth  in the working -age population  is argued  to have outpaced  job creation  rate. Although  official  \\nunemployment  rate at 4.2%,  youth  unemployment  rate is 10%,  and for youths  with a bachelor/  higher  \\neducation,  it is 34%.  The quality  of the labour  force  remains  weak;  32% do workforce  do not have \\neducation,  26% have primary  level  education,  and less than 6% have tertiary  education  (LFS  2016 -17). \\nLow female  labour  force  participation,  youth  unemployment  and youth  NEET,  and erosion  of real wage  \\nare key market  challenges.   COVID -19 aggravated  job creation  with economic  activities  staggering  at a low \\npace,  leadin g to loss in income  and employment  for millions  of people,  especially  those  engaged  in small  \\nscale  manufacturing,  service  and informal  sectors.  ICT Division  proposes  five immediate  short -term \\ninterventions:  a) establish  a universal  employability  registry;  b) develop  national  strategy  to revamp  all \\ntraining  and skill development  curricula;  c) introduce  online  platform  for small -scale  loans  for the \\nCMSMEs;  d) establish  employment  generation  schemes;  and e) initiate  short -term unemployment  benefits.  \\nSoftware:  The software  industry  is propelling  with a remarkably  optimistic  future  in terms  of growing  \\npotentials  and job creation  opportunities  for millions.  However,  proper  intervention  of the government  and \\nadaptive  policy  reformulation  will be required  to continu e the momentum  of this sector’s  growth.  COVID -\\n19 resulted  in significant  loses  for the sector;  BASIS  estimates  around  $800  million  equivalent  of \\ninternational  orders  and $500  worth  of domestic  work  orders  have  been  cancelled  the past few months.  \\nDespite  the changing  modes  of businesses  during  the crisis,  demand  for only a few software  categories  \\nincreased.  The sector  already  suffers  from  lack of local  and global  market  intelligence,  ineffective  \\npromotional  branding  strategy,  inability  to retain  skilled  empl oyees,  limited  access  to finance,  and inability  \\nto reach  the last mile clientele  due to high transmission  costs.  The ICT Division  proposed  on the following  \\nimmediate  short  term interventions:  a) develop  market  intelligence  through  assessing  local  and globa l \\nmarket  demands  and opportunities;  b) remodel  promotional  strategies;  c) support  other  line ministries  and \\nindustries  for successful  operation  shift;  d) support  strategies  for retaining  skilled  employees  and creating  \\nemployment  with FDI; and e) promote  local software  products  and services,  employment  and self-\\nsustainability.  \\nDigital  Device:  Bangladesh  has vast prospects  in the digital  device  sector.   Availability  of workforce  at \\ncompetitive  wages,  domestic  market  demand,  and favourable  policy  structure  are some  of the key factors  \\nthat make  Bangladesh  an attractive  market  for digital  device  manufacturing.  The shift in remote  working  \\nduring  the COVID -19 crisis  led to remarkable  increase  in the demand  for computers,  laptops,  and \\nnetworking  devices.  However,  disruptions  in imports  led to increased  prices  in the market  and the \\nlockdown/holidays  exacerbated  the local  market.  The need  for Bangladesh’s  own manufacturing  hub of \\ndigital  devices  became  more  significant.  Enabling  policies  are required  to ensure  investme nts and \\nfavourable  environment  for growth.  Several  factors  like high capex,  lack of skillsets,  quality  assurance  and \\ninternational  certification  requirements,  and lack of financial  stimulus  halted  this sector  during  the \\npandemic.  The ICT Division  proposes  to conduct  the following  immediate  short -term interventions:  a)   \\n \\n677 \\n encourage  purchase  of locally  assembled  products  in government -funded  projects;  b) incentivize  quality  \\nassurance  certification  of local  digital  device  products;  c) promote  “Made  in Bangladesh”  products  in \\nlocal/global  markets;  d) attract  foreign  investment  and foreign  companies  in the Hi-tech parks;  e) provide  \\npolicy  support  to incentivize  local  production/assembling;  and, f) address  the lack of skilled  manpower  or \\nmigration  of skilled  manpower .  \\nBusiness  Process  Outsourcing:  The growth  of the business  process  outsourcing  (BPO)  has been  \\nimpressive  in the last decade.  Robust  IT infrastructure,  skilled  human  resources  and supportive  government  \\npolicies  are supporting  this. The industry  employs  over 50000  people  and is exporting  services  to European  \\nand North  American  clients.  However,  absence  of internationally  recognized  certification,  lack of strong  \\nconnections  with foreign  clients,  poor market  intelligence,  limited  country  branding,  and lack of financial  \\nstimulus  have  constrained  the sector.  95% of BPO  firms  in Bangladesh  have lost revenue  due to COVID -\\n19. The BPO  firms  are estimated  to have suffered  a loss of around  1730  crore  BDT  from  domestic  market,  \\nwhich  includes  revenue  coupled  with net operating  loss. IT budgets  have shrunk  for most  organizations,  \\nbut it is expected  that there  will be a continual  growth  in demand  for BPO  services,  with cost optimization  \\nbeing  the primary  driver  for offshoring  services.  The ICT Division  proposes  the followin g immediate  short -\\nterm interventions:  a) create  a universal  grading  system  or professional  certification  for the workforce;  b) \\nremodel  promotional  strategies  and branding;  c) aggressive  marketing;  d) penetrate  into post COVID -19 \\ntarget  markets;  and e) invest in developing  necessary  skills  for leveraging  new opportunities.   \\nISP and Infrastructure.  Accelerated  growth  of internet  users  (103 million  as of June 2020)  is contributing  \\nto establishing  “Digital  Bangladesh”,  an integral  part of the government’s  Visio n 2021.  During  COVID -\\n19, people  are relying  more  and more  on the internet,  which  is becoming  an essential  part of the economy.  \\nThe crisis,  however,  possesses  new challenges  for the ISP and infrastructure  sector.  Increased  internet  \\ntraffic  reduced  bandwidth  per head,  making  working  from  home  more  difficult  with slower  speed.  With  the \\ndeclaration  of national  holiday/shutdown,  ISPs were  unable  to collect  2-3 months’  bills.  The sector  faced  \\nissues  with accessing  working  capital  from  banking  sector  under  the government  stimulus  package.  In \\naddition,  complex  VAT  structure  in the ISP value  chain,  lack of cash,  lack of National  Data  Protection  and \\nlocalization  rule impacted  their business  environment.  The ICT Division  proses  the following  immediate  \\nshort  term interv entions:  a) withdrawal  of VAT  on ISPs;  b) facilitate  access  to working  capital  under  the stimulus  \\npackage;  c) facilitate  faster  port clearance  and reduced  duties;  d) provide  proper  safety  gears  and necessary  health  \\nsupport;  e) incentivize  to set-up and provide policy  support  for local  data centres  and cloud  operators.  \\nAgriculture  and Food  Security:   Despite  Bangladesh’s  noteworthy  food production  and stock,  compared  \\nto other  COVID -19 hit nations  globally,  food security  (which  involves  proper  distribution  of food,  \\navailability  of food,  and people’s  purchasing  capacity)  remains  uncertain.  During  the COVID -19 shutdown,  \\nfarmers  lost an estimated  TK 565 billion  ($6.7  billion),  and people  involved  in agriculture  experienced  a \\nnet income  loss of 80% (with  66% repor ting zero income).  Around  15.5 million  (or 66%)  of those  employed  \\nin the country  are in this sector.  Nutrition  of pregnant  women  and children  marginalized,  and low-income  \\npopulation  have been  severely  impacted.  Fragmented  access  to information,  market  disruptions,  inefficient  \\nnational  coordination,  disconnect  with e-commerce,  absence  of commodity  exchange  system,  and lack of \\nmarket  price  monitoring  hinder  this sector.  Despite  investment  in application  of ICT in agriculture  by the \\nGovernment  for over a decad e, digital  literacy  among  farmers  remains  low and there  is no comprehensive  \\nreal time data for effective  decision -making.  ICT Division  proposes  the following:  a) kiosk -based  mobile  \\napplication  through  PPP;  b) online  marketplace  for agro-machinery  rental;  c) connect  farmers  with e-  \\n \\n678 \\n commerce  and social  media  platforms;  d) localized  agro-advisory  and e-training  platform  for enhancing  \\nfarmers’  digital  literacy;  and e) digital  marketplace  and commodity  exchange  through  PPP and private  \\nsector  led models.   \\nHealth  Sector:  Bangladesh  faced  challenges  with a burdened  public  health  sector  and reckless  private  \\nsector  health  service  providers.  Denial  of treatment,  false  covid -19 reports,  day long queue  for Covid -19 \\ntests and lack of treatment  are some  of the grieving  comp laints.   The critical  challenges  identified  are in \\ngovernance,  management  and private  sector  management.  In addition,  the private  sector  lacks  effective  \\nregulation.  The ICT Division  proposes  the following  short - and medium -term action  agenda:  a) establish  a \\nrobust  referral  system  with medical  history  management;  b) connect  all private  facilities  with the GoB \\nsystem  to get real-time data on patients,  ICU,  HDU  and other  facilities;  c) establish  inventory  management  \\nsystem  for all facilities  and introduce  decentralized  procurement;  d) develop  a grievance  mechanism  policy,  \\naddressing  system  using  ICT where  sufferers  can submit  their complaints  and receive  solutions;  and, e) \\nintroduce  telemedicine  in a coordinated  and standardized  manner,  involving  community  clinics and \\npharmacies,  and policy  revisions  ensuring  service  quality  and mental  health  at the forefront.  \\nFreelancing:  Bangladesh  supplies  16% of total global  online  workers  (second  highest  in the world).  \\nFreelancing  is becoming  increasingly  popular  among  the youth  in Bangladesh  and globally.  The COVID -\\n19 pandemic  devastated  the hard-earned  outcomes  gained  by freelancers  in past years.   According  to \\nBangladesh  Freelancers  Development  Society  (BFDS),  around  80% freelancers  are now out of work  as \\norders  fell by 60-70%,  where  freelancers  involved  in only domestic  market  are the most  affected.  During  \\nthe pandemic,  transactions  in the bank  were  halted,  to some  extent,  initially.  However,  the already -present  \\ncomplication  in cashing  out the payment  for the freelancers  has been  ever-difficult  during  the pandemic.  \\nThe sector  already  suffered  from  payment  issues,  absence  of global/local  market  analysis,  lack of skill \\ntraining  and mentorship,  and inadequate  access  to last mile and affordable  high-speed  internet  in rural  areas. \\nLack  of appropriate  financial  stimulus  further  impacted  this sector.  The ICT Division  is proposing  the \\nfollowing  interventions  in the immediate  short -term:  a) address  cross  border  payment  issues;  b) promote  \\nglobal/local  market  analysis;  c) launch  profe ssion  development  programmes ; d) brand  Bangladesh  as an \\nICT skill destination;  and, e) establish  last mile affordable  and high-speed  connectivity.  \\nEmerging  Technologies:  In Bangladesh,  companies  are incorporating  emerging  technologies  (artificial  \\nintellige nce, robotics,  ai, big data,  block  chain , etc.) to fulfil  the new market  demand.  The Government  \\nintroduced  policies  and strategies  to create  an ecosystem  and promote  emerging  technology.  In response  to \\nthe COVID -19 crisis,  the Government  jointly  collaborat ed with private  sector  to accelerate  the adoption  of \\nemerging  technologies.  Global  supply  chain  disruptions  will have an impact,  but for some  emerging  \\ntechnology  led businesses,  the pandemic  has become  a growth  opportunity.  Key drawbacks  in the pursuing  \\nthe emerging  technologies  include  inadequate  skill and capacity  development,  lack of promotion  and \\nfunding,  inadequate  knowledge  of such technologies  in the education  sector,  and lack of policies.  The ICT \\nDivision  proposes  the following  immediate  short -term interventions:  a) create  an ecosystem  for \\nencouraging  emerging  technology  R&D;  b) promote  emerging  technology  start-ups; c) promote  and fund \\nemerging  technology  solutions;  d) promote  emerging  technologies  in the education  sector;  and e) ensure  \\nimplementati on of policies  and strategies  supporting  emerging/frontier  technology  solutions.   \\n   \\n \\n679 \\n Public  Sector  Transformation  and Innovation:  Since  the launch  of ‘Digital  Bangladesh’  in 2009,  \\nBangladesh  has become  a global  example  of digital  transformation  of public  services.  The Government  has \\nmade  all necessary  information  of the Ministries  and other  relevant  notifications  available  for public  \\nthrough  various  websites.  The National  ICT Infra -Network  for Bangladesh  Government  Phase  II was \\nestablished  (which  already  implemented  800 video  conferencing  systems  at different  Ministries,  \\nDepartments  and Upazila  offices  with the aim to ensure  10Gbps  capacity  network  at the Upazila  levels  and \\n100 Gbps  capacity  networks  at the District  levels).  The government’s  e-governance  initiative  comprises  5 \\ncomponents  – Service  Process  Simplification  (SPS),  ‘less paper  office,’  government  services  portal,  land \\ninformation  services,  and government  forms  portal.  The SPS aims  to simplify  processes  involved  in public  \\nservice  delivery  and reduce  the time required  to deliver  them.  A total of 424 public  services  were  included  \\nin this programme  till early  2020,  and more  will be included.  COVID -19 pandemic  disrupted  the \\ntransformative  aspiration  articulated  in perspective  plan 2041  (PP2041).  The top five action  agenda  \\nproposed  are: a) effective  and scaled  up 2000+  citizen  centred  services;  b) paperless  government;  c) \\ninstitutionalization  of innovation  culture;  d) citizen’s  participation  of innovation  culture;  and, e) data-driven  \\npolicy  framework.  \\nPriva te Sector  Transformation.  Private  sector  plays  a pivotal  role in Bangladesh  and contributes  in the \\neconomic  growth  through  investment,  production  and export.  Private  investment  to GDP  ratio in \\nBangladesh  was 23.40  % (Bangladesh  Economic  Survey  2019).  COVID -19 impacted  all sectors  in \\nBangladesh  and private  sector  is adversely  affected  as well.  The private  sector  can be impacted  by a big \\nnegative  shock  in terms  of private  sector  growth,  employment  consumer  spending,  etc. The financial  sector  \\nwill also be adversely  affected.   Key constraints  to the private  sector  due to COVID -19 include  interruptions  \\nin production  and manufacturing,  shift to alternative  sale channels,  disruptions  in distribution  and supply -\\nchain  networks,  accessibility  and utilization  of ICT and digital  tools,  accessing  global  market  place  due to \\nstrict  regulatory  mandates,  and lack of comprehensive  workforce  database.  The ICT Division  proposes  the \\nfollowing  interventions:  a) address  the digital  divide;  b) launch  digital  online  training  program;  c) link local  \\nmanufacturers  with global  marketplaces;  and, d) digitize  workforce  database.  \\nCreating  a domino  effect:  The proposed  interventions  or action  agendas  in the priority  sectors  are \\ninterconnected.  As such,  one intervention  in one sector  can have a ripple  effect  across  several  sectors.  This \\ncan be defined  as a domino  effect.  The ICT Division  will undertake  the following  priority  interventions  in \\nthe different  priority  sectors:   \\nAction Agenda  Policy Implication  Timeline for \\nimplementation  \\n\\'Made in Bangladesh ’ \\nboost in ICT and emerging \\ntechnologies  ● Development and enactment of \\'Made in Bangladesh\\' Policy \\nfor digital devices for domestic and foreign market  FY 2021  \\nNational Policy and  \\nAgenda for Start -ups ● Introduction of National Policy for Start -ups to promote \\ngrowth of the ecosystem, while also attracting foreign \\ninvestment  FY 2021  \\nFinancial data \\ninteroperability speeding \\nup financial inclusion by \\n10X ● Enactment of Data Interoperability Law  \\n● Enactment of Data Protection and Privacy Law [e.g., GDPR]  \\n● Revision of Digital Security Act, 2018 to connect with \\nindependent law on data protection and privacy  FY 2021    \\n \\n680 \\n Action Agenda  Policy Implication  Timeline for \\nimplementation  \\nUniversal affordable access \\nto digital device  ● Development of guideline covering all citizens under \\n\\'universal access to digital device and Internet \\' program  \\n FY 2021  \\nUniversal affordable access \\nto Internet broadband \\nconnectivity  \\uf0b7 Upgrading National Broadband Policy, 2009 for:  \\n-    Inviting districts and upazil a level investors and start -ups to \\noffer broadband services  \\n-      Revision of TAX, VAT, and  Surcharge to decrease Internet \\nprice  FY 2022  \\nInteroperable and \\nconnected health \\nmanagement systems  Health system is transformed from \\'doctor -centric\\' to \\'healthcare \\nmanagement centric’  \\n- Development of an accountability framework for both \\npublic and privat e facilities  \\n- Development and enforcement of a mandatory health data \\ninteroperability protocol  \\n- Launching of universal health insurance system for public \\nand private facilities  FY 2022  \\nPaperless government  Introduction of Paperless Government Act  FY 2022  \\nLaunching of Universal \\nIdentity System [UIS] with \\nprofiling for multi -purpose \\nuse Inter -agency working group for appropriate design and \\nroadmap for UIS  \\nEnactment of Data Interoperability Law  \\nEnactment of Data protection and Privacy Law [ e.g., GDPR]  FY 2022  \\nAlternative credit rating \\nsystem for CMSMEs and \\nvulnerable citizens  Enactment of a law for CMSME credit rating system with \\nemphasis on credit bureau database under Bangladesh Bank \\nOrder, 1972  FY 2022  \\nFacilitating bottom -up e-\\ncommerce for livelihood of \\nlocal producers and \\nartisans  Upgrading National Broadband Policy, 2009 for revision of \\nTAX, VAT, and Surcharge to decrease Internet price  \\nUpgrading National Digital Commerce Policy, 2018 for \\nexemption of taxes imposed on digital commerce and \\nadvertising  FY 2022  \\nDigital commodity \\nexchange for agriculture \\nproduce connecting \\nfarmers at their doorsteps  National policy for quality standards for different agro -\\ncommodities in Bangladesh  \\nNational Agro -Commodity Exchange Policy  FY 2022  \\nNational Skills Registry for \\nboth the formal and \\ninformal economy  Introduction of National Skills Registry Policy  FY 2022  \\nUniversal coverage of \\ndigital financial services  Digital Financial Inclusion Policy to incentivise digital financial \\ntransactions across the population  FY 2023  \\nTransformation of \\neducation to 4IR adjusted \\nblended learning approach \\nfor all citizens  Digital Education Policy [in alignment with 8th Five-Year Plan]  \\nUp gradation  of Intellectual Property Rights [IPR] Policy to \\nensure appropriate encryption and to protect the providers of \\nonline education  FY 2023  \\nUniversal affordable access \\nto digital literacy  Development of digital literacy curriculum guideline for each \\nsegment of learners by public and private agencies  \\nMaking curriculum and content for digital literacy o pen \\n[creative commons licensing]  FY 2025  \\nEase of Doing Business \\nIndex, 50 by 2025  Introduction of Ease of Doing Business Policy catering to each \\nof the 18 sectors  FY 2025  \\n   \\n \\n681 \\n It is expected  that the implementation  of these  interventions  would  lead to domino  effect  as illustrated  in \\nthe following  diagram:  \\n \\n12.5 OVE RALL OBSERVATIONS, RISK FACTORS  AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \\nDigital Bangladesh agenda for improving public service delivery, connecting industry to global digital \\nspace, and creating new industries ultimately d epends on technological upgrading; but import driven \\ntechnology upgrading runs the risk of hurting Bangladesh’s competitiveness. As a countervailing measure, \\nBangladesh should participate in the global value chain of technology development and innovation f or \\nadding value out of knowledge.  \\nFirst with the steam, then  was followed by electricity and computing -driven industrial revolutions.  Recent \\ntechnological breakthroughs in the broad area of digital technologies seem to be pushing yet another wave, \\nwhich is commonly called the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). In the age of 4IR, Bangladesh’s \\n  \\n \\n682 \\n technology import driven, labour -based value addition strategy is under serious threat. Along with skill \\nuplifting, Bangladesh must focus on knowledge economy buildi ng by leveraging 4IR technology stack.  \\nDigital Bangladesh, ICT and Knowledge economy form the core competence to address inclusive \\nsustainable industrial development for making Bangladesh an advanced economy by 2041. The 8FYP  \\nshould focus on developing an d leveraging this competence for creating jobs and income opportunities, \\nforming new industries, addressing environmental issues, minimizing energy and material use, improving \\nindustrial competitiveness, enhancing capital utilization, and establishing effe ctive linkages between actors \\nof knowledge economy.  \\nDespite the recent progress, Bangladesh suffers from serious deficiency in capacity for leveraging the \\nopportunity of Digital Bangladesh, ICT and knowledge economy out of innovations. The 8FYP  should \\naddress both market system and directional failures. Due to the presence of such failures, Bangladesh’s \\nrelevant agenda is primarily technology import driven. It’s time to focus on jobs creation, local value \\naddition, and economy wide value -added effect, as op posed to public expenditure centric revenue of the \\nICT industry.    \\nAdvanced digital technologies allow for fully integrated, connected, and smart production processes, where \\ninformation flows across operations and generates real -time feedback to support d ecision -making (such as \\nuse of smart sensors and machine -to-machine communication, robots , big data analytics, cloud computing, \\nartificial intelligence and 3D printing). To graduate from analogue stage to this smart production stage, \\nBangladesh should focu s on acquiring knowledge, and adopting craftsmanship culture of pursuing endless \\nperfection through technology absorption and adaptation, scientific discoveries and technology invention \\nas opposed to continuing technology import driven leapfrogging strateg y.  \\nIncreasing digitization is posing threat to data privacy, taking over local market by global ones, unfair \\ncompetition, non -productive usages of technologies like smartphone and social networking, social isolation \\nof youths and addictive attachment with  technology, and new form of digital divide. The 8FYP should pay \\nserious focus on these critical issues.  \\nAt the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution and the mission of attaining SDGs, Bangladesh has started \\nthe journey of graduating from low middle -income country status to be high middle -income country by \\n2031, and advanced country by 2041. Graduation from factor driven to knowledge economy by leveraging \\nadvanced digital technologies appears to be critical requirement for Bangladesh to cope up as well a s \\nleverage 4IR and SDGs, while progressing towards economic milestones. Existing mind -sets and \\ninstitutional capacity appear need to be significantly uplifted to make expected success in this mission.  \\nThe 8FYP will also aim to address the issues of deteri orating e -participation (as tracked by the UN E -Gov \\nSurveys) particularly with regard to e -service delivery. It will aim to reduce the skills gap at multiple levels  \\nin agencies and among citizens. This will include ethnography;  know your customer insights research, data \\nanalytics, design thinking, sense making  and futures thinking.  \\nFor COVID 19 response, the ICT Division will help educational institutions adapt to the rapidly changing \\ntechnology landscape driven by the COVID19 pandemic. It will facilitate use of evidence to inform \\ndecision -making about education technology. Furthermore, ICT Division will develop a Digital Learning   \\n \\n683 \\n Ecosystem by equipping each institution with all required digital infrastructure facilities through public -\\nprivate -partnership. It will develop a centralized educational resource repository for curating all innovative \\nsolutions in preparation for future emergencies. The division will ensure teachers\\' professional development \\nso that they can host online/distance learning facilities  for students. It will design and initiate student -led \\nassessments and personalized learning spaces using artificial intelligence and/or other means where it is \\nfeasible.  \\nIndicators for Measuring Progress of Digital Bangladesh.

The Government is mindful of the taxation issue and will take actions to resolve it \\nsatisfactorily and ensure that Bangladesh remains an attractive destination for ICT investments. Regarding \\npublic investmen t, the strong foundations laid in the Sixth and Seventh Plans provides a solid platform to \\nbuild upon in the Eighth Plan.  During the Eighth Plan the main investment priorities will be:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure rapid and satisfactory completion of all on-going  ICT projects.  \\n\\uf0b7 Upgrade ICT infrastructure to provide space for projected growth of ICT services in adequate speed \\nand reliability.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide funding for R&D in ICT & Science and Technology  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide funding for ICT capacity building in public institutions  \\n\\uf0b7 Support ICT initi atives to expand services in the rural areas (cloud - based service, National \\nhelpline, BPO, Incubation Centre, ICT Research & Development centre, Broadband connectivity \\netc.) \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and implement an e -government master plan  \\n\\uf0b7 Support product innovation & c reation ecosystem  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide physical incentives & Institutional reform to create appropriate investment climate  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish Virtual University, Multimedia University  \\n\\uf0b7 Support in promotion of Bangladesh ICT Industry in the global market to brand Bangladesh as a  \\ndestination for software, hardware, BPO, freelancing and ICT Innovation.  \\n \\nThe ADP for ICT infrastructure development and Science and Technology are shown in Tables 12. 14 and 12. 15. \\nTable 12. 14: ADP Allocations for Science & Technology and ICT Sectors dur ing 8th Plan  \\n(Taka billion current prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Science and Technology  91.0 92.3 106.4  124.2  149.0  \\nInformation and Communication \\nTechnology Division  17.0 25.4 39.9 55.9 74.5 \\nSector Total  108.0  117.7  146.3 180.1  223.5  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 12. 15: ADP Allocations for Science & Technology and ICT Sectors during 8th Plan  \\n(Taka billion FY2021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Science and Te chnology  91.0 87.6 96.1 106.9  122.4  \\nInformation and Communication \\nTechnology Division  17.0 24.1 36.0 48.1 61.2 \\nSector Total  108.0  111.7  132.1  155.0  183.6  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Part 1, Annex Table A5.2    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSECTOR 13:  \\nRECREATION, CULTURE AND RELIGIO N \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n687 \\n CHAPTER 13 \\nCULTURE , INFORMATION , RELIGION , SPORTS AND  \\nYOUTH DEVELOPMENT   \\n13.1 BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW  \\nThe development of nations hinges on the social and cultural make up of its population since this predicts \\nthe response, capacity and efforts made my individuals in nation building and also affect the decisions that \\nthey take in their lives. Upholding the culture is upholding the characteristics and profile of a nation’s  \\npopulation and this has a strong influence in the way the population engage with ea ch other and for the \\nwelfare of the nation as well. Bangladesh has a rich cultural history and has significant archaeological  assets \\ndispersed across the country. In addition to that, in terms of literature, music and arts, the intellectuals of \\nthe country  are continuing to make progress. In today’s global village, it is the citizen’s duty to showcase \\nthe cultural heritage and contribute to the progress of future generations and to the world. Intrinsic to a \\nnation’s identities is also the religious beliefs and practices, which is again an integral part of the cultural \\nfabric of our nation.  \\nBangladesh has traditionally been a tolerant society with co -existence of people from different religions \\nand practices. In the world that we live in at present, indiscri minate freedom to practice one’s religious \\nbeliefs and respect of all religions is an essential part of development of nations and required for excelling \\nactively in the global economy.  \\nAs Bangladesh embarks upon its 8th Five Year Plan, it is essential to  also set concrete plans to ensure \\ncontinued proliferation of the culture, heritage and religious practices of the country. These are the main \\nfocus of this Chapter of the Plan along with the focus on youth and sports development. Bangladesh is a \\nnation wi th over one -third youth population and this segment of the population is our national demographic \\nasset. It is imperative for Bangladesh to provide its youth population with the physical and intellectual skills \\nto perform to their full capacity and drive t he growth and prosperity of the nation. In addition to that, the \\nchallenges facing the nation related to climate change, militancy, an ageing population and continued \\npoverty can only be addressed by investing in the future generations that are the youth o f today. The \\ngovernment has been devoted to the development of youth and plans to continue investing in their future \\nin the upcoming five years, so as to pave the way to for achieving the development goals and commitments \\nat the national level and the inte rnational level such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  \\n13.2 CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF BANGLADESH  \\nThe Ministry of Cultural Affairs (MoCA) is the arm of the government devoted to conservation of culture \\nand heritage of the people. Through its different organ izations/units, the ministry is primarily focused on \\nenriching the intellectual status of the nation through preservation, research and development of culture, \\nhistory, heritage, arts and literature. Under the 8FYP, various activities will be undertaken th at will promote \\nthe healthy growth of cultural activities throughout the country. The main units in operation under the \\nMoCA and who are actively engaged in various aspects of cultural development and conservation of the   \\n \\n688 \\n country are as follows: Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, Bangla Academy, Public Library, National Book \\nCentre, National Archives and National Library, Department of Archaeology, National Museum, Folk Art \\nand Crafts Foundation, The Copyright Office and seven (7) cultural centres  for small ethn ic groups, which \\nis to be expanded by three (3)  newly installed  cultural centres .  \\n13.2.1 Progress during the 7FYP and Emerging Challenges  \\nProgress during  the 7FYP  \\nProgrammes for development of Bengali language and literature and reference books for high er education \\nwere continued with greater emphasis. Within the framework of national unity, steps were taken to preserve \\nand promote language, arts and culture of ethnic communities through cultural centres  in tribal areas. To \\nrestore and preserve many of t he intangible and tangible cultural heritages that are on the verge of \\nextinction, digitization efforts were implemented. The Ministry also reiterated the importance of \\narchaeological sites by conducting national surveys and conservation programmes for fur ther development. \\nProgrammes were undertaken to develop museums and folk art. To enhance appreciation of fine arts, \\nvarious fine art subjects were introduced in primary and secondary schools as per education policy.  \\nThe continued efforts of MoCA and its va rious units has had impacts on poverty reduction and gender \\nissues in the past and is expected to continue to contribute to same in the future. Construction, renovation \\nand development of infrastructure to facilitate the pursuit of art and culture have cre ated employment \\nopportunities for the poor. Efforts were made to reduce their poverty by providing financial support to the \\ndistressed cultural workers through a social safety net program that has been in operation for a significant \\nnumber of years. The ac tivities of the establishment, expansion and development of Shilpakala Academy \\nand library at dis trict and upazi la level were continued under the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy and the \\nDepartment of Public Library respectively.  Students and people from imp overished backgrounds were \\nprovided free education materials from both public and private libraries. Besides, for the purpose of \\nconducting cultural activities in the secondar y schools in district and upazi la levels, the recruitment of \\nvarious trainers has played an important role in reducing poverty through generating jobs. Additionally, \\nfrom an archaeological  tourism perspective, proper renovation, preservation and development of \\narchaeological sites have also created employment opportunities for the poor  people. Higher tourist visits \\nto archaeological  sites and museums have led to the expansion of business and commerce of local \\nimpoverished population and new employment opportunities were created.  \\nConstruction and development of infrastructure of librari es by Directorate of Public Libraries have \\ncontinued at the district and upazi la levels to provide and expand reading services for the population. In \\naddition to promoting learning and knowledge transfers, these construction and development activities have  \\ncreated employment opportunities for the poor. Furthermore, students from the poor households and people \\nfrom impoverished backgrounds were able to access academic and leisure reading materials from the public \\nlibraries.  \\nThe activities of bodies establis hed under the MoCA in the form of establishment and expansion of \\nShilpakala Academies at the dis trict and upazi la levels, and the preservation, expansion and development \\nof folk art and culture through Bangladesh Folk Arts and Crafts Foundation have widene d the scope for a \\nsignificant number of women to learn more on the art and culture.  Moreover, opportunities for employm ent   \\n \\n689 \\n of poor women population were  created from women’s participation in cultural infrastructure development. \\nThis has resulted in  greate r empowerment, awareness, mental development and social welfare of women, \\nwhich had a significant impact on women\\'s overall development. In the last three fiscal years, eight women \\nwere given Koshy  Padauk , 3.95 million women were given readers services, an d 360 women were trained \\nin music. A large number of stalls were allocated for women in ‘ Amar Ekushey  Book Fair’ organized by \\nthe Bangla Academy. In the initiative of Bangladesh People\\'s and Crafts Foundation, 183 women were \\ntrained in folk -arts and crafts . These activities were aimed at enhancing the confidence, power and dignity \\nof women in Bangladesh and enabling more economic and social empowerment  \\nThere was greater participation of women groups in public -private libraries. Besides, through the \\nopportun ity of reading in the library, women\\'s skills, intellectual development and socio -economic \\nconditions were enhanced.  \\nCultural development, awareness and practices have also helped in building the mind -set and spirit of the \\nyouth of the nation. The Governme nt of Bangladesh is committed to fight terrorism, drug addiction and \\nfundamentalism.  This has played an important role in preventing the growth of a terrorist mentality, drug \\naddiction or similar negative outcomes of the society especially among its youth . Appreciation and respect \\nfor culture and sports has also played an important role in shaping the values and mind -set of the youth \\ntowards competitiveness, respect for effort and the need to excel, and the development of harmonious \\nrelationship with the o utside world.    \\nFuture Challenges  \\nIn order to preserve and develop tangible and intangible cultural heritage of Bangladesh involvement of \\npeople at the grassroots level is required to ensure participatory planning. Many of the intangible cultural \\nheritag es like language literatures, arts, performing arts, music and other areas are at the verge of extinction \\nand require  urgent efforts and intervention to document  preserve and uphold them. Significant attention \\nneeds to be given to the restoration, preserva tion and digitization of these emblems of our cultural heritage. \\nThere is also a dearth of institutional establishment as well as human resources for such delicate works, and \\nthese resources needs to be developed urgently. Responding to the need to promote  and preserve cultural \\nvalues, the government has taken steps to support vulnerable artists that have been hit by COVID -19 \\nthrough cash incentives.  The government also intends to extend social protection benefits to them as well.  \\nThe Archaeological sites are invaluable assets and mark  the rich history of Bangladesh. Unfortunately, \\nowing to matters such as shortage of funds, skilled human resources and community involvement, most of \\nthese sites remain unexplored and are yet to be preserved or restored. Adeq uate and systematic planning is \\nrequired to address this and like most other sectors, perspective, and medium -term and long -term plans \\nneeds to be carried out. According to the new education policy school curriculum subjects like art, music, \\ndance theatre etc. has been designated as optional subjects. Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy needs to be \\nequipped to produce a large number of subject oriented texts and train teachers for matching with national \\neducation policy requirements.    \\n \\n690 \\n 13.2.2 Objectives of the 8th Five Year Plan  \\nUnder the 8FYP, healthy growth of cultural activities will be promoted throughout the country. In addition \\nto promotion of literature, fine and performing arts, attention will be given to create and promote a culture \\nattuned work, towards p erseverance, confidence and creativity. The 8FYP objectives and strategies of the \\nMinistry of Cultur al Affairs  and Ministry of Liberation War Affairs have been developed incorporating the \\ntargets under Sustainable Development Goal 11.4 that postulates the need to ‘ Strengthen efforts to protect \\nand safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage’.  \\nThe major objectives in this field are:  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop Bengali language and literature and create facilities to develop Bengali as the medium of \\ninstruction.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote the spirit of liberation war; preserve, protect and development of historical and liberation war \\nmonuments, memorial plazas, mass graveyard etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Creation of liberation war -based videos and films and running motivational programmes  for future \\ngeneration, pa rticularly youths.   \\n\\uf0b7 Help and promote production and publication of quality books and make them available to the masses \\nat reasonable prices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Undertake programmes for implementation of the national book policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Carry out research on the lives and works of great men and women of our nation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Flourish the perception of ‘Amar Ekushey’.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish and develop a library network system from the national to the rural level and introduce modern \\ntechnology through the entire network.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote and foster cultural activ ities and citizen participation throughout the country reflecting values, \\nhopes and aspirations of the people.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop infrastructural facilities for fine and performing arts including drama and theatre and explore \\nprivate and voluntary involvement in this  area.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preserve national history, culture and heritage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote good citizenship through sensitization of rights, duties and responsibilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Protect copy rights of intellectual property.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preserve and promote language arts and culture of small ethnic gr oups/communities within the \\nframework of national unity and awareness.  \\n\\uf0b7 Collecting information and data regarding cultural elements or traits of the Ethnic Minority community \\nwhich includes their unique language, literature, music, dance, heritage, crafts,  rituals etc. Development \\ninterventions will be carried out to patronize and nourish indigenous intangible and tangible cultural \\ntraits and elements.  \\n\\uf0b7 Exchange of culture with the neighbouring  countries.  \\nPracticing traditional or local culture will be encou raged to fight terrorism, drug addiction and other \\nnegative impact of modernisation by giving more attention to younger generation.      \\n   \\n \\n691 \\n 13.2.3  Strategies under the 8th Five Year Plan  \\n\\uf0b7 Amend the Antiquities Act to strengthen the protection of archaeologic al sites and historical monuments.   \\n\\uf0b7 Amend the Copyright Act and other relevant acts to support smooth growth of cultural arena.  \\n\\uf0b7 Programmes will be undertaken to develop the library network, infrastructural facilities and services \\nfrom national to the rura l levels in order to meet the education, recreational, cultural and information \\nneed of people from all walks of life.  \\n\\uf0b7 National survey on archaeological sites will be carried out and physical facilities for the department of \\narchaeology will be developed f or enhancing archaeological tourism;  \\n\\uf0b7 Fine arts like music, painting, arts & crafts, recitation, acting; dancing, theatrical performances would \\nbe introduced at primary & secondary level as per education policy.  \\n\\uf0b7 Infrastructure facilities will be expanded t o root level for ensuring better opportunities in practicing \\ncultural field.  \\n\\uf0b7 Programmes for development of Bengali language and literature and reference books for higher \\neducation will be continued with greater emphasis;  \\n\\uf0b7 Programmes will be undertaken for book development and development of reading habits;  \\n\\uf0b7 Research programmes on lives and works of great people will be undertaken and memorial libraries and \\ninstitutions will be established in respective areas;  \\n\\uf0b7 Regional and ethnic minority’s cultures will be  promoted and preserved through various programmes \\nviz. erection of more tribal cultural and language centres  within the tribal areas;  \\n\\uf0b7 Continue dissemination of the real history of liberation war among the young generations.

In this light Establishment, broadcasting and operation of Comm unity Radio \\nPolicy 2017 has been formulated with a view to implement “Digital Bangladesh -Vision 2021”. At the same \\ntime, Roadmap from the Transition from Analogue to Digital Terrestrial Television in Bangladesh 2014 \\nhas been prepared with the assistance of  Bangladesh National Roadmap Team (NRT) and International \\nTelecommunication Union (ITU). Initiatives have been taken to establish monitoring cell for combating \\nrumours  and militancy. In order to translate these policies into reality, Ministry of Informatio n has \\nimplemented total 13 development projects during last five years, amounting to an approximate amount of \\nBDT 766 cores.

The main operational units under the ministry are: Islamic Foundation,  Office of the Waqf \\nAdministrator, Hajj Office Dhaka and Jeddah/ Makkah, Hindu Religious Welfare Trust, Buddhist Religious \\nWelfare Trust, Christian Religious Welfare Trust and some administrative branches of the Ministry. The \\nmain objective of the MoRA is to improve and enhance religious affairs and activities in the country and \\ncontribute to the national development through continued initiatives for human resource development and \\nworking to foster brotherhood (unity), values, harmony and uphold religious b eliefs in the national and \\ninternational arena.  \\nThe s trategic objectives of the Ministry of Religious Affairs  include :  \\n1) Enhancing moral and ethical values;  \\n2) Improving  Hajj Management;  \\n3) Institutional Development of Religious Institutions and Organizations;  \\n4) Strengthening Zakat Management;  \\n5) Public Awareness Activities for preventing religious militancy and terrorism.    \\n \\n696 \\n 13.4.1 Progress during  the 7FYP  \\nThe operational units under the MoRA have been conducting various development activities over the years \\nwhich hav e had significant contributions to the socio -economic development of the country through social \\nsafety net programmes , education programmes  and other empowerment initiatives. The operational units \\nunder the Ministry have been involved in various programmes  which have contributed to generating \\nemployment, poverty alleviation, economic and social empowerment of women as well as for youth \\ndevelopment. Some of the major development achievements of the Ministry over the 7FYP are as follows:  \\nMosque Based Child & Mass Literacy Program (Phase 6) project:  Some 73, 768 education centres  were \\nestablished under this project which facilitated providing training on basic literacy, Islamic values and \\nideals to 9.86 million children and illiterate adults.  \\na) Expansion and Stre ngthening of Mosque Library Project (Phase 2):  Under this project, 4500 new \\nlibraries were established in mosques in rural areas which provided reading facilities and aided in \\ndeveloping reading habit among the rural population and contributed to knowledge  expansion.  \\nb) Establishing 560 Model Mosques & Islamic Cultural Centres in Districts & Upazil as of Bangladesh:  \\nUnder this initiative, 560 model mosques and Islamic Cultural Centres  are under construction to create \\nprayer facilities and generate employment fo r the daily labours  and also other socio -religious facilities.  \\nc) Shirta, Mymensingh & Kalkini, Madaripur Islamic Mission Hospital Complex Construction and Baitul \\nMukarram Diagnostic Center Strengthening Projects:   The Shirta, Mymensingh & Kalkini, Madaripur \\nIslamic Mission Hospital Complex is under construction and upon completion will provide free medical \\nservices to the poor and disadvantaged people.  \\nd) Gopalganj Islamic Foundation Complex Establishment Project:  The Gopalganj Islamic Foundation \\ncomplex, which is currently under construction, is aimed at training of religious leaders to enable them \\nto play a more meaningful role in social development as well as be more self -dependent and also \\nknowledge to provide basic/primary medical services to the poor and di sadvantaged people of society. \\nCollection of Books and Expansion of Reader’s Service at National Level and District Libraries of \\nIslamic Foundation Project: The Central District libraries and Imam Training Academy Libraries were \\nenriched by collecting book s under this project on various Islamic topics and socio -development issues \\nas well. This has expanded the resource base of the libraries, therefore increasing the knowledge tools \\naccessible to the local populations of the areas these are based in.  \\ne) Islamic  Books Publication Project (Phase 2):  Under this project, about 8098 format books on various \\ntopics about Islam has been published and were distributed to the Islamic Foundation district offices to \\nmake them available for purchase by the local population.  \\nIn addition to the employment generated through the various construction projects, 96,000 jobs were created \\nthrough, pre -primary education, Holy Quran learning, adult education centres  and resource centres  all over \\nthe country.  \\n These projects implemented  during the 7FYP and other interventions implemented over the years, have \\ncontributed to the development of religious education and appreciation of the need for better moral and   \\n \\n697 \\n responsible conduct.  Emphasis has also been placed on the importance of relig ious freedom, tolerance  and \\nrespect for all religions. Bangladesh takes pride in promotion religious harmony and freedom to practice \\nreligion.  \\nNevertheless, there is scope for further progress. There is still a need for appropriate institutional \\nframework , adequate skilled human resource and capacity for proper implementation and impact on \\ndevelopment. The overall sub sector also faces constraints to smooth implementation of projects in the form \\nof delays in release of allocated Annual Development Project budget, lack in skilled human resources due \\nto inadequate training facilities, timely recruitment of manpower for project implementation and delays in \\nprocurement of goods, services or land for construction projects. These matters need to be streamlined an d \\nthe authorization process needs to be regulated in order to expedite and ensure proper and timely \\nimplementation of development projects and also to maximize their efficiency and impact.  \\n13.4.2 Objectives of the 8th Five Year Plan  \\nThe development object ives and targets of the Ministry of Religious Affairs for the 8FYP has been \\nformulated in accordance to the Constitutional Obligations of the country, the Election Manifesto of the \\ngovernment, Vision 2041, and Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

Significant progress has been made in development of sportin g \\nfacilities such as building and developing open stadiums and indoor stad iums from the national to upazi la \\nlevels, also building swimming pools across the country to encourage swimming sports and fitness. The \\ngame of football has been developed through va rious tournaments and organized management of the \\nFootball Academy in Sylhet. The standard of cricket has also been raised through a number of different \\ninitiatives, including building and upgrading facilities to meet the international standard. Infrastruc ture and \\nrelated facilities for football and cricket, and other sports, were established at the rural level across the country.  \\n13.5.2 Objectives for Sports Development under the 8FYP  \\nThe Ministry of Youth and Sports is dedicated to raise the standard and achievements of promising athletes \\nand sportsmen through providing latest training programmes  and modern facilities through its operational \\nunits such as Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishthan (BKSP) and the National Sports Council (NSC). It is \\nexpected that  the talented promising athletes will participate and achieve success at the regional and \\ninternational level competitions and bring glory to the country. This is the main goal of the institution along \\nwith other objectives which as listed below:  \\n   \\n \\n700 \\n \\uf0b7 Increase  the standard of national sports and games to the international standard.  \\n\\uf0b7 Proper talent identification through arranging talent hunting and training programmes  for all kinds \\nof sports.  \\n\\uf0b7 To improve the standard of games and sports at the Division and Distric t levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and expand playgrounds and sports facilities at the Upazilla and Union levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop sports infrastructural facilities for both men and women, as well as facilities for indoor \\ngames.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and provide sports infrastructural facilities  for football and cricket games at the  upazi la \\nlevel.  \\n13.5.3 Targets for Sports Development under the 8FYP  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of regional sports institutions with proper facilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Continued development and renovations of national cricket and football stadiums t o maintain and \\nuphold international standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop tennis sports infrastructure at the district level.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of Division level National Sports Complex.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish sports relat ed infrastructures at the Upazila and Zi la levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop indoor stad iums, swimming pools at District levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop over 1000 play fields in the country at the union level.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construct Women’s Sports Complex in all Divisions and further develop existing Women’s Sports \\nComplex.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of Sports Complex for Youth at Dis trict levels.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of sports complex for the persons with Disability (PWD) in Dhaka and other \\ndivisional cities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Construction of international standard cricket and football stadiums  \\n13.6  DEVELOPMENT OF THE YOUTH  \\n13.6.1 Challenges for Youth Develop ment  \\nAs against the backdrop of a growing youth population, the summary picture that emerges from a review \\nof experience in dealing with the youth challenge is as follows.  \\n\\uf0b7 The youth population grew from 10 million in 1974 to 44 million in 2017 and is proj ected to grow \\nto 48 million in 2026 and then starting to decline. This suggests that the on-going  demographic \\ndividend potential is still available to Bangladesh for several more years but will not last long.  \\n\\uf0b7 As compared to this potential, actual use is m odest.  According to LFS 2016 -17, only 20 million \\nyouth (44%) were in the labour  market, of which 17.9 million were employed (89.5%).  \\n\\uf0b7 The employment profile suggests a strong outward migration of the youth workforce away from \\nagriculture into industrial se ctor, services and international migration. Yet, the average earnings of \\nthe youth labour  force are substantially lower than the adult workforce (30 -64 years) and an \\noverwhelming proportion of the youth work in informal employment.     \\n \\n701 \\n \\uf0b7 Some 2.1 million of th e youth labour  force was unemployed in 2016 -17, suggesting a youth \\nunemployment rate of 10.6%, which is substantially higher than the national unemployment rate of \\n4.2%.  \\n\\uf0b7 An estimated 12.3 million youth (2 9.8% of the youth population) were not in employment , \\neducation or training (NEET).  \\n\\uf0b7 The highest unemployment rate is for the youth in age group 15 -19 (12.7%), while 23% of the \\nNEET population belongs to the 15 -19 age groups . This raises a policy question about the \\neffectiveness and outreach of the educatio n system to this potential school -age group of youth.  \\n\\uf0b7 The profile of unemployed youth shows that the education level is much higher than the education \\nprofile of the national labour  force. Some 64% of the unemployed youth had secondary level or \\nhigher edu cation.  An estimated 36% had higher secondary or tertiary education.  \\n\\uf0b7 For 60% of the unemployed youth, the unemployment duration is 6 months or less, which is a \\npositive factor.  Yet, 21% were unemployed up to a year and 19% were unemployed for a long \\ntime, exceeding 1 year.  This large duration of unemployment can create substantial disincentive \\nfor motivating the youth to go through the formal education system and is another reflection of the \\nlow quality of the education system and weak relevance to the job market.    \\n\\uf0b7 Looking at the gender dimension, the unemployment rate for the female youth is systematically \\nhigher at all age group relative to male youth.   They also have on average a longer wait period to \\nget a job than male youth.  Importantly, the fe male youth is dominant part of the NEET with an \\noverwhelmingly large majority (87%).   \\n13.6.2 Progress during  the 7FYP and Future Challenges for Youth Development  \\nProgress during  the 7FYP  \\nThere is now a growing awareness in the government that the emerging  youth employment challenge is \\nbecoming a major development concern. The government understands that the on-going  demographic \\ndividend will not last forever and there is a substantial gap between the availability of this dividend and its \\nactual use. All th e government national planning documents including the Perspective Plan 2021, the \\n6thFYP, the 7thFYP and the Perspective Plan 2041 recognize the importance of properly harnessing the \\ndemographic dividend and the associated youth population for achieving th e related development goals and \\ntargets.  The government has also endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the associated \\ntargets for developing the youth population, especially related to the education and employment goals.  \\nThe government’s strong emphasis on converting the youth into a central development force is reflected in \\nthe adoption of the National Youth Policy during the 7FYP. The National Youth Policy 2017 (NYP2017) \\nhas become the centrepiece  of the government’s youth strategy and p olicy framework.  This is a \\ncomprehensive set of goals and policies that seek  to develop the youth to its full potential.  The key themes \\nand objectives of the NYP2017 are illustrated in Table 13.1.  \\nAs can be seen, the N YP2017 identifies 5 key themes and 13 objectives where youth involvement is \\nnecessary for full national development including self - growth, education and training, employment, social \\nprotection, sustainable development and nation building.  N YP2017 emphasizes inclusiveness for all youths   \\n \\n702 \\n irrespective of gender, religion, ethnicity and location. N YP2017 emphasizes the development of youth \\npolicy consistent with the SDGs, the Perspective Plan 2021 and Vision 2041 (and by implication the \\nforthcoming Perspective Plan 2041). The responsibility fo r coordinating the policy is vested to the Ministry \\nof Youth and Sports.  The N YP will be updated on a 5 -year cycle . \\nTable 13.1: Key Themes and Objectives of the National Youth Policy 2017  \\nTheme  Objectives  \\nSelf-Growth  a.

Efforts were made to create \\nemployment and self -employment opportunities for unemployed youths i n 7 districts of North Bengal in \\ntwo phases of the project. Technological advancement initiatives for the youth were undertaken such as the \\nTechnology Empowerment Centre  on Wheels for Underprivileged Rural Young People of Bangladesh \\nproject and Innovative Management of Resources for Poverty Alleviation through  Comprehensive \\nTechnology (IMPACT) project. Support was also provided to develop the National Plan of Action for \\nImplementing National Youth Policy and Youth Development Index.  \\nSome of the major achie vements through these projects and the continued efforts of the institution are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 1.61 million Youth  have been trained on different trades and off them, 3,33,521  are self -employed.  \\n\\uf0b7 A total of 2,29,737  youth has been trained for creation of tempor ary employment for two years of which \\n2,27,402  were engaged in temporary employment in the different nation building organizations.  \\n\\uf0b7 BDT 6.213  billion was disbursed to 1,25,335  trained youth as loan from principal amount and revolving \\nfund to establish and expand self -employment projects. The average loan realization rate was a \\nremarkable 95.53% and the income of the youth from these investments ranges from BDT 6000 - 50,000 \\nand in some exceptional cases over BDT 100,000 per month.  \\n   \\n \\n703 \\n Despite progress, t he gro wing size of the youth unemployment problem as well as the expanding share of \\nthe NEET youth population suggests that much stronger efforts are needed in the 8FYP to address the \\ngrowing challenge of the youth population with a comprehensive approach. The a rticulation of a \\ncomprehensive national youth policy is an important step. This now needs to be converted into 5 -years  \\nAction Plan with monitorable targets, strategies and resources. Since implementation spreads across various \\nline ministries, a proper coo rdination mechanism needs to be identified.  An M&E system needs to be \\ndeveloped to measure implementation and progress. Substantial resources will be needed.  \\n13.6.3 Objectives for Youth Development under the 8FYP  \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Y outh Employment  \\nThe 8FYP objectives and targets for the development of the youth will be guided by the he UN goals for \\nyouth employment are most recently articulated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is \\nfurther elaborated in the UN’s World  Youth Report 2018 (UN 2018).  The World Youth Report considers \\nthe development of youth in totality, of which youth employment is a subset. The relevant SDGs that \\ndirectly bear on the youth employment challenge are summarized in Box 13.1. The UN Report al so \\nhighlights the importance of developing performance indicators to measure progress. Bangladesh as a \\nsignatory to the SDGs can use this broad -based global youth employment target as an important reference \\npoint to develop the policy framework for youth e mployment moving forward.   \\n Box 13.1: Youth Employ ment and Sustainable Development Goals  \\nTarget 4.1:  By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary \\neducation leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes  \\nTarget 4.3:   By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational \\nand tertiary education, including university.  \\nTarget 4.4:   By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, includi ng \\ntechnical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship  \\nTarget 4.5 : By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education \\nand vocational training for the vulnerable, including per sons with disabilities, indigenous peoples \\nand children in vulnerable situations  \\nTarget 4.6:  By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve \\nliteracy and numeracy  \\nTarget 8.3:  Promote development -oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, \\nentrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro -, \\nsmall - and medium - sized enterprises, including through access to financial services  \\nTarget y 8.5 :  By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including \\nfor young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value  \\nTarget 8.6:   By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of you th not in employment, education or training.  \\nSource: UN 2018    \\n \\n704 \\n 13.6.4 Objectives /Targets for Youth Development under the 8FYP   \\nObjectives:   All the SDG targets for youth relate to education, training and employment opportunities for \\nyouth in order to youth.  This is not surprising, given  that at the global level these are the most critical \\naspects of youth development challenge.  The Bangladesh situation summarized above confirms that \\nBangladesh faces a similar situation. So, the objectives and targets for youth development under the 8FYP  \\nare focused on education, training and employment issues faxing the youth population .  The main objectives \\nContribute in accelerating economic growth and creating decent employment opportunities through \\ntransforming youth into skilled human resources.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enable and empower the youth for achieving the youth -related SDGs , and Vision 2041 . . \\n\\uf0b7 Contribute to ensure national sustainable development, progressive and inclusive economic \\ngrowth.  \\n\\uf0b7 Undertak e measures for empowering the youth by providing life skills and em ployment skills.  \\n\\uf0b7 Provide development training and ensure participation of youth in decision making process at all \\nlevels of society and the nation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen education quality and quantity at all levels as discussed in Chapter 10.  \\n\\uf0b7 Eliminate gender gap in tertiary education as discussed in Chapter 10.  \\n\\uf0b7 Implement the government’s women empowerment strategy and policies as articulated in chapter \\n14 to eliminate all bias against female youth and enable her to fully participate in all relevant human \\nactivities.   \\nTargets:   The SDGs provide a relevant reference point to set the time -based and monitorable goals for \\nyouth employment. Taking advantage of this, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has recently adopted a \\nquantitative target of reducing NEET population to a  mere 2% by FY2031.  This is a laudable target and \\nall effort should be made by the government to achieve this. More broadly, based on the SDGs, the \\nsuggested youth employment targets for the periods FY2021 -FY2031encompassing the Eighth and the \\nNinth Five Plans are shown in Table 13. 2. These targets are broadly consistent with the SDGs and the \\ntargets set in the PP2041.  \\nTable 13. 2: Youth Employment Targets FY2021 -FY2031  \\nIndicator  Base year values \\n(2016 -17 LFS)  FY2025  \\n(End of 8FYP  FY2031  \\n(End of 9 FYP)  \\nPercentage of unemployed youth  10.6 5.0 2.0 \\nPercentage of NEET youth  29.8 15.0 5.0 \\nPercentage of 15 -19 years in school  75 85 100 \\nSource: Ministry of Youth and Sports for NEET target; GED projections for other targets.  \\n13.6.5 Strategies and Policies for Y outh Development under the 8FYP   \\nThe 8FYP strategies and policies for youth development could be organized under three themes: the labour  \\nmarket demand side policy interventions; the labour  market supply side interventions; and interventions to \\npromote se lf-employment  and other related youth employment policies.  \\n   \\n \\n705 \\n A. Supply Side Policies  \\nStrengthen the skill base of the existing youth labour  force: The above supply side policies seek to \\naddress the skill deficiencies of the potential youth labour  force.  T he skill gap is very serious for the existing \\nyouth labour  force already in employment. These youth  cannot be retrained by bringing them back to the \\neducation system. There are two types of unskilled youth employed labour  force: those with little or no \\neducation (zero - primary level); and those with reasonable exposure to the schooling system (secondary \\nand above).  \\nThe first category is recognized under SDG target 4.6 that seek to ensure that by 2030 all youth and a \\nsubstantial proportion of adults, both m en and women, achieve literacy and numeracy. The basic challenge \\nis to impart basic literacy and numeracy skills to this labour  force through publicly funded programmes . \\nThe governments Non -Formal Education (NFE) program seeks to address this skills gap. T he major concern \\nis that the NFE looks at the task only as raising the adult literacy rate with a conventionally narrow definition \\nof literacy. This is not relevant in relation to developing skills for growth because it is now well -recognised \\nthat it makes  little difference in the quality of life of people or the contribution they can make to society \\nand economy. This is why the concept of lifelong learning has been included in the SDG education goal \\nand targets. It is necessary now to connect literacy, bas ic skills development and lifelong learning \\nopportunities and envisage learning provisions, facilities, and resources complementing and supplementing \\nthe formal education system. Widespread use of ICT resources for organised lifelong learning, e.g., throug h \\na nationwide network of community learning centres, and expanding self -learning opportunities, have to be \\nkey features of non -formal education and lifelong learning. Literacy level of the population, non -formal \\nand informal livelihood and life skills dev elopment, and ICT -based access to information and self -learning \\ntools and resources must be supported and promoted in a coordinated way through a lifelong learning \\nstrategy. Adequate funding and organization based on partnership between NGOs, local communi ty, \\nMinistry of Education and local government officials is necessary.  \\nFor the second category, the main challenge is to impart them with relevant on -the-job training in strong \\npartnership with the business sector. Bangladesh has a good experience with thi s type of training in the case \\nof the RMG sector. The female youth employed by the RMG sector in the early years of its evolution were \\nall provided with in -house training to adequately perform the job for which they were recruited. \\nUnfortunately, there are  not many examples of this type of enterprise -funded on - the- job training owing to \\nmarket failure reason. A private enterprise is not willing to spend own resources for substantial training \\nbecause of the risk that the trained worker may leave for another  enterprise. This is a classic case for public \\npolicy intervention.  \\nA strategy for public -private partnership for on - the- job-training scheme can be developed, where the \\npublic sector provides the funding while the private sector imparts the training. Th ere are two strands of \\nthis strategy. The first element concerns partnership with enterprises in the formal sector. The SEIP project \\nhas some elements of this. Based on the lessons of SEIP experience, a broader public -private partnership \\ntraining scheme fo r on-the-job training could be developed.  The second element should be geared to \\naddressing the training needs of youth who are employed in informal sector, who are self -employed, who \\nbelong to the NEET group, and who are looking for international migrati on opportunities. The large bulk \\nof the youth is in this category. The government does not have the resources or the capacity to service the   \\n \\n706 \\n training needs of these youths.  The most promising option to reach these youths  and bring them in the fold \\nof trai ning for employment is to enter into partnerships with the donor community and the NGOS.  \\nThere are several good examples of innovative and cost -effective pilot projects related to training of youth \\nsponsored by the donor community in partnership with the N GOSs. The largest NGO -led youth training \\nprogramme is managed by BRAC under its Skill Development Programme (SDP).  The SDP is multi -donor \\nfunded and according to BRAC over the past 8 years some 400 thousand youths, a large part of which is \\nwomen, have rec eived training in various employable skills in non -agriculture sector. Other good examples \\ninclude: the Bangladesh Youth Employment Pilot (BYEP) sponsored by the USAID (EDU, 2009); the \\nBangladesh Empower Youth for Work (BEYP) sponsored by the Oxfam (Oxfam 2019); and the Youth \\nEmployment through Skills (YES) initiative supported by the UNDP (UNDP 2019). The BYEP program \\nfocuses on developing employable skills for the youth linked to the fresh water prawn farming activity.  \\nThe BYEP pilot seeks to promote dec ent job and climate -friendly entrepreneurship for rural youth in the \\nclimate vulnerable poverty -stricken areas. The YES initiative seeks to mobilize crowd funding  to finance \\nICT skills development of youths through a 6 -month training program. Each of these  pilots are innovative \\nin their approaches and yet follow the common principle of providing training that will lead to employable \\nskills related to market demand. These types of training are much more cost -effective and sustainable \\ncompared to the low -return National Service Program.  The government should review these pilots carefully \\nand scale up training efforts through grant assistance in partnership with the donor community and the \\nNGOs.  \\nConsidering the Covid -19 pandemic and its adverse impacts, there  is a demand for transforming the class -\\nbased training into an online virtual training. Such virtual platform will provide training and life -skill \\nopportunities to people regardless their age, gender and geographic location within the country.  \\nEnsuring edu cation and training for all:   The SDG Goal 4.5 seeks to eliminate by 2030 gender disparities \\nin education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, \\nincluding persons with disabilities, indigenous people s and children in vulnerable situations.  The \\ngovernment gets solid mark on this for creating a favourable  policy environment for eliminating all forms \\nof social discrimination in the society including in the matter of access to education and training.  Th e \\nrelevant policy initiatives are articulated in the 7th Five Year Plan (Government of Bangladesh 2015). To \\npro-actively promote the cause of women, the government has also adopted the NWDP 2011.  The main \\nchallenge moving ahead is to implement these polic ies more strongly and monitor progress. The \\ngovernment may want to assign monitoring responsibilities to concerned line ministries with a requirement \\nto prepare annual progress reports on implementation that should be submitted to the cabinet for review.  \\nAddressing the challenge of the NEET: The NEE T stock presents a complex challenge. This is not simply \\na matter of providing better training. An expert task force led by the Ministry of Youth  and Sports  should \\nbe tasked with the responsibility of doing a so lid diagnostic study of this complex multi -dimensional \\nproblem and come up with a long -term solution. Several measures can be taken to prevent a worsening of \\nthe situation.  \\nFirst, some 83% of the NEET are women. The tougher implementation of the child mar riage law and laws \\nto prevent violence against women, and the elimination of gender gap in access to tertiary and vocational \\neducation will be a major step to reduce the female entry to the NEET group.  Second, the implementation \\nof the 12 years compulsory  education will help reduce the NEET population substantively. Third, quality   \\n \\n707 \\n enhancements in education and training discussed above will help reduce the incidence of both the \\nunemployed youth and the NEET population. Fourth, the government can develop an outreach scheme in \\npartnership with NGOs / CBOs that provides incentives to the existing NEET population to actively \\nparticipate in employment -based training schemes.  Finally, a major missing element in the government’s \\ncurrent youth employment policy is the promotion of self -employment schemes (discussed below).  This can \\nplay a catalytic role on lowering the incidence of youth unemployment as well as the incidence of NEET.     \\nB. Demand Side Policies  \\nThe demand side policies for youth employment are focu sed on creating jobs that are most suitable for the \\nyouth, especially the educated youth.  While both the adult and youth work force will benefit for higher \\neconomic growth and economic transformation, there are some specific areas where strategic youth -focused  \\npolic ies will help.  \\nPromotion of Youth Self - Employment through  Entrepreneurship  \\nA striking feature of the Bangladesh employment structure is the dominance of the self -employed worker \\ngroups (Figure 13.1). According to LFS 2016 -17, an estimated 55.6%  of the employed population were \\nself-employed, either as own account worker (44.3%) or as contributing family helper (11.5%).  Not \\nsurprisingly, self -employed working population was much larger in the rural economy (61.7%) as compared \\nwith the urban econo my (40.4%), owing to the dominant role of the family -based agriculture sector.  \\nFigure 13.1: Distribution of employed population by employment status (%)  \\n \\n               Source: Labour Force Survey 2016 -17 \\nThe high percentage of own account worker is an im portant indicator of market response to weak wage \\nemployment opportunities. The percentage of youth involvement in own account worker (30.6%) is \\nsubstantially lower than for adult (30 -64) workforce (49.1%).  This is explained by two factors: first the \\nyouth own account worker is typically a kind of apprenticeship working under family or friend supervision \\nin family / friend owned business without full compensation for the effort. As such, there is a reluctance of \\nyouth, especially educated youth, to work un der family ownership; and second, youths typically do not \\n0.010.020.030.040.050.060.0\\nEmployer Own account\\nworkerContributing\\nfamily helperEmployee4.347.6\\n14.133.3\\n4.935.7\\n4.754.0\\n4.444.3\\n11.539.1Rural Urban National  \\n \\n708 \\n have access to start -up capital to set up own business.  This is a major policy area where promotion of youth \\nentrepreneurship through training and access to start-up capital can provide a major boo st to youth \\nemployment and wellbeing.   \\nNon-ICT based self -employment:  This characteristic of the labour  market suggests that there is a strong \\npotential role for creating jobs for the youth through self -employment schemes. In a broad sense, the \\nCMSEs are a part of the self -employment scheme. As noted, the CMSEs are dominant in Bangladesh and \\nthe second largest source of employment. The range of activities covered is huge and can easily \\naccommodate all the unemployed and NEET youth who are willing to partic ipate in this market. So, policies \\nto promote CMSEs noted above can also facilitate the growth of self -employed youth.   \\nHowever, special efforts will be needed to jump start the self -employment prospects of the existing cohort \\nof unemployed and NEET youth s.  Two specific actions will be needed.  First, action will be needed to \\nimpart the training for entrepreneurship. The government can enter into partnership with the donor and \\nNGO communities to impart these types of training. Second, access to credit wil l have to be ensured. This \\nlater policy of enhancing access to institutional credit for individual entrepreneurs and small business is a \\nfundamental development challenge facing Bangladesh and is among the most pressing policy reform for \\njob creation.  \\nICT-based self - employment:   Perhaps the best prospects for self -employment for the educated youth is \\nthrough the promotion of ICT based self -employment. The demand for ICT skills is huge in the labour  \\nmarket. Additionally, a thriving ICT -based self -employment  in a range of services including web design, \\nmobile financial services, e -commerce, and transport has emerged. The rapid growth of mobile financial \\nservice (MFS) has created a large market for qualified MFS agents, who essentially are self -employed and \\nserve as service agents for a number of MFS providers. There is also a thriving group of self -employed web \\ndesigners who are providing online services both nationally and abroad. Self -employment in e -commerce \\nand transport services based on use of ICT is cha nging the urban landscape of Dhaka city.  \\nThe potential of self -employment for youth based on ICT is best illustrated by looking at the progress with \\nthe global online labour  market, also known as “freelancing and gig working via internet platforms”.   The \\nonline labour  market based on internet websites has grown rapidly across the globe. The online labour  \\nplatforms match buyers and sellers to deliver a range of services that can be done remotely using internet. \\nExamples of these services include: software d evelopment; data entry, translation, multi -media, sales and \\nmarketing support and professional services. A unique characteristic of the online labour market is that the \\nwork is transnational and many transactions cross national boundaries. This essentially  means, the online \\nworker need not be constrained by domestic demand and can actively bid for online demand globally.  \\nTo track the growth of online labour  market, the Oxford Internet Institute has initiated a labour  Project. As \\na part of this project, res earchers Otto Kassi and Vili Lehdonvirta have developed “ The Online Labour \\nIndex” (Kassi and Lehdonvirta 2018).  The index seeks to measure the growth in demand and supply of \\ninternet based labour by type of product and country of origin.  According to the latest available Online \\nLabour data, much of the demand for global online services comes from the USA and Europe. The United \\nStates is the largest user of these services (44%), followed by the United Kingdom (8%) and Australia (6%). \\nOn the supply side, the  largest supplier of online labour is India (26%), followed by Bangladesh (21%) and \\nPakistan (14%).  This is a remarkable finding for Bangladesh and illustrates the future prospects for growth \\nwith better and more enabling ICT policies.    \\n \\n709 \\n Some further insig hts on future prospects for access to global online labor market can be obtained from \\nlooking at the product demand for online services. The largest demand is for software and technology \\nservices (36%), followed by creative and multimedia (25%). Data entry  and routine clerical work is at the \\nlower end of the online market (13% market share). Bangladesh’s supply of software development and \\ntechnology online services is still very low and substantially lower than in India. The global demand for \\nthis service i s large and growing and the Bangladesh youth employment can benefit a lot with focused \\npolicy effort to the development of these skills and associated infrastructure.   \\nClearly, the potential for creating self -employment opportunities for the educated yout h is huge, especially \\nfor ICT -intensive services where the female youth can have an especially strong presence, working from \\nthe secured environment of their homes.  To enable the full potential of the self -employment option, a \\nnumber of policy reforms are  needed.  The most important is the access to institutional credit. The \\nimplementation of reforms advocated in the MSME financing study is of critical importance.  In particular, \\nthe study advocates policies and use of ICT solutions to sharply bring down t he transaction costs for \\ndelivering institutional credit to small business and individual enterprises.  \\nThe second policy measure is to accelerate the growth of ICT infrastructure and ICT -based services. Despite \\nthe rapidly growing adoption of ICT business  solutions, the expansion prospect is sub -optimal and \\nconstrained by the availability of quality network (Table 6).  The use of internet and smart phones is still \\nlagging behind other countries.  A major reason for this is the heavy taxation of ICT service s (Ahmed 2017). \\nOn the demand side this has constrained the use of smart phones and internet services, while on the supply \\nside this has limited the private -sector led supply of ICT infrastructure and lowered service quality.  So, the \\nreform of ICT taxatio n is an essential policy reform that will provide a substantial boost to GDP growth \\nand employment in Bangladesh, including youth employment.  \\nThird, the regulatory framework for self -employed ICT specialists and other ICT -based services must be \\nmade con ducive to their growth.  For example, the registration and licensing requirements for web -\\ndesigners, e -commerce and ICT -based transport service providers must be simple and low -cost. Foreign \\ncurrency regulations need to be simplified to enable retention and ac counting for earnings from \\ninternational i -labour  services. These should be treated at par with remittance income from migrant labour .  \\nFurthermore, the tax filing requirements should also be simple.  The taxation of CMSEs and self -employed \\nenterprises is a big challenge that needs careful study and enabling solutions.  \\nInternational Migration  \\nBangladesh has benefitted tremendously from its large pool of legally migrant labour , especially to the \\nMiddle East, both in terms of job creation and huge inflow of remittance income that now accounts for over \\n5% of GDP. In addition to supporting the balance of payments and poverty reduction through direct income \\ntransfers, these remittances have been an important contributor to GDP growth and job creation within \\nBang ladesh through the derived demand effects of expenditures from remittance income. While \\ninternational migration is a part of the national employment strategy that is being covered in a separate \\nstrategy document, all policies relevant to developing the mig rant labour  force participation, such as \\ntraining, cost -reduction of migrant labour  supply, availability of loans to pay for the migration process, and \\navailability of information, as well as policies to ensure labour  safety and protection  from exploitatio n will \\nalso benefit the youth population. Indeed, the youth population is the highest beneficiary of the international \\nlabour  migration.      \\n \\n710 \\n Labour market information  \\nWhen jobs exist, youth can be helped by providing information and employment exchange ser vices through \\neducational institutions, or by offering these in youth centres. The use of new technologies, particularly \\nmobile phone based, could help in expanding job search networks for youth, linking formal and informal \\nnetworks, and increasing the eff ectiveness of these networks. This is clearly an area where further \\ngovernment attention is needed.  \\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \\nThe National Youth Policy 2017 sets laudable goals for youth employment and youth empowerment but it \\ndoes not have an operational strategy to implement the goals and targets that have been set.   It does not \\nalso define time -bound targets to measure progress with the implementation policy. One important policy \\nreform would be to make this policy more operational.  In that connection,  it will be helpful to design a \\nresults -based monitoring framework with specific quantitative targets to measure progress with \\nimplementation. As a part of this monitoring and evaluation framework, the NYP2017 must target progress \\nwith reduction in the inc idence of unemployed youth and the share of NEET youth as suggested in Table \\n13.2 above.  \\n13.7 8FYP DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ALLOCATIONS FOR CULTURE, \\nRELIGION, SPORTS AND YOUTH  \\nThe 8FYP would support the implementation of all priority programmes for recreati on, culture and religious \\naffairs as inputs to the fuller development of the moral and human qualities of the population.

Led by a caring and humane Prime \\nMinister  Sheikh Hasina , Bangladesh has m ade a commendable stride  to accomplish the dream of the father \\nof nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to become a prosperous and just country that treats all \\ncitizens equally irrespective of caste, creed, religion or gender, where all citizens have eq ual opportunities \\nto participate in the development process and the fruits of development are shared equitably.  So, along \\nwith rapid income growth, a focus on human well -being is a major priority of her government. This priority \\nis reflected in PP2021, P P2041, the 6FYP and the 7FYP in an integrated manner based on several \\ndimensions. These include a commitment to poverty reduction and human development, provision of \\nfinancial support to the poor and the vulnerable, reduction of all forms of risks that thr eaten human welfare, \\nand the promotion of social inclusion to enable participation of all citizens in development.    \\nProgress with poverty reduction and human development during the 7FYP and strategy for further \\nadvancement in these areas during the 8FYP were discussed earlier. This Chapter reviews the progress in \\nother determinants of human welfare relating to social protection, social welfare and social inclusion during \\nthe 7FYP. Against the background of past progress, the Chapter develops the targets a nd strategies in each \\nof these areas for the 8FYP. In each case, the targets and strategies are linked to the concerned SDGs and \\nimplementation of the related targets and strategies of PP2041.  \\n14.2 SOCIAL SECURITY  \\nBangladesh made impressive progress in the are as of economic growth and poverty reduction. Economic \\ngrowth has had a strong impact on poverty with head count poverty rate halved from 50 per cent in 2000 to \\n24.3 per cent in 2016. Bangladesh is also committed to eradicate extreme poverty by FY2031. Howe ver, \\nrising inequality (measured by various inequality indices – Gini; and Palma ratio) tend to suggest that \\n‘economic growth’ may not be fully inclusive (Figure 14.1). Accordingly, the 7FYP of Bangladesh \\nemphasized on the need to reduce poverty and inequa lity to promote inclusive growth. Poverty projections \\nusing existing poverty elasticity of GDP growth show that unless this elasticity is increased substantially \\nby reducing income /consumption inequality, even economic growth in the range of 8 to 9 per ce nt may not \\nbe sufficient to eradicate extreme poverty by FY2031. A combination of progressive income taxes and \\ngenerous income transfers to the poor and the vulnerable through the social protection system - can play an \\neffective role to increase the povert y elasticity of GDP and help eliminate extreme poverty in Bangladesh \\nby FY2031.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n714 \\n Figure 14.1: Extreme Poverty and Inequality Trends in Bangladesh (%)  \\n \\n        Source: Based on HIES 2016   \\n \\nA key component of the fiscal policy is social protection. The prime objective of the social protection \\nsystem is to protect and promote the welfare of individual beneficiaries as well as society as a whole. \\nBangladesh has been spending about 2.2 per cent of GDP on social protection. However, a large share of \\nthis (1%  of GDP) finances civil service pensions. Furthermore, available M&E indicators of the social \\nprotection system in Bangladesh reveal that the system is not apparently  efficient; and cos t-effective  as \\nwell. As a result, the value for money of the Bangladesh  social protection system is not very high . Based \\non the National Social Security Strategy (NSSS) , some progresses have been made  in SP system by \\nembracing the life cycle approach. However, there are various impediments to implementation that remain \\nas cha llenges. As a result, progress was not fully achieved compared to the  reform targets set in 7FYP. \\nThus, there is an urgency to accelerate the SP reform agenda as set out in NSSS in the 8FYP. Moreover, \\nthe importance of wider and inclusive social protection  system is now of paramount importance to fend off \\nthe social and economic perils imposed by COVID 19 that face s a large segment of Bangladesh population.  \\n14.2.1 Key Features and Challenges of the Social Security System in Bangladesh  \\nSocial Security Progr ammes   \\nLarge Number of Small Schemes : The number of schemes implemented under the social security system \\nis still very large. During the last five fiscal years, the number of schemes under the social protection \\nschemes varied between 115 and 130 between FY  2017 and FY 2019. The number of schemes is around \\n55 when only the schemes under the non -development budget are considered. However, closer review of \\nthe social security budget suggests that more than 75 per cent  of the non -development social security bud get \\nis accounted for by the 30 large schemes covering a major part of the beneficiaries. When the development \\nbudget is considered along with the non -development budget, allocation to the 30 large programmes is \\nreduced to about 50 per cent . When considerin g the smaller schemes, some of the small programmes are \\ntoo small to have any major impact whether they are consolidated or are left to exist as they are. GED \\ncompleted research on small programme harmonization recommended that there is potentially room to  \\nexplore harmonization of similar smaller schemes to increase some administrative eff iciency without much \\nimpact on budgetary efficiency .14 \\n                                                     \\n14  Social Security Policy Support (SPPS) Programme (2019)  ‘Harmonisation of Small Social Security Programmes: Issues and \\nPolicy Options’ in General Economics Division (GED), Bangladesh Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning, Government \\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. A Compendium of Social Protection Researches.  \\n  \\n \\n715 \\n Low-Effort Management : Available data suggests that in Bangladesh administrative cost of cash and CCT \\nis around 4 per cent, while administrative cost of food schemes has been found at around 10 per cent . These \\nare significantly  lower than the global average of 8.2 per cent  for CCT/Cash programmes and 25 per cent \\nfor the food assisted programmes. These low administrative costs do not reflect efficiency of programme \\ndelivery; rather they are the result of low -effort management that is reflected in high exclusion and inclusion \\nerrors and leakage of resources.   \\nCoverage  \\nBeneficiary Coverage:   Number of beneficiary coverage as  percentage of total population has hovered \\nbetween 32 and 34 per cent  during FY2015 and FY2018. One important observation is the beneficiary \\ncoverage that is higher than the prevailing poverty rate (i.e. around 20 per cent), implying all poor and \\nvulnerab le populations are covered the  system also has large exclusion errors  and inclusion errors . When \\nthese are taken into consideration, the coverage of the poor becomes low .  \\nLow Coverage for Children:   A UNICEF study (2019) using MoF Social protection budget  data found that \\nin FY 2010, 3.5 per cent of the total social protection budget was spent for 5.6 per cent child beneficiaries. \\nWhile in FY 2016, 2.4 per cent of the total social protection budget was spent for 2.3 per cent child \\nbeneficiaries. There is no  programme to support families and caregivers in their child -care roles other than \\na few child -care centres  in urban areas for female government employees. UNICEF’s ending child marriage \\nscoping analysis of budget allocation (2018) identified 64 government  programmes and projects (with an \\naverage allocation of 1.15 per cent of total government budget over FY 2011 to FY 2016) that \\ndirectly/indirectly contributed to ending child marriage in Bangladesh. However, the high prevalence of \\nchild marriage may questi on adequacy as well as efficacy of these programmes in ending child marriage in \\nBangladesh. The programmes for orphans and other vulnerable children are also inadequate.  \\nLow Beneficiary Coverage in Urban Areas:  Currently the beneficiary coverage to urban l ocations is \\ndisproportionally low. Bangladesh has been witnessing a rapid rate of urbanization with a rate of 35 per \\ncent recorded in FY 2015 likely to increase to 50 per cent by 2035. Migration of rural poor has slowed \\npoverty reduction rate in urban area s. Poverty reduction is only 10 percentage in urban areas compared to \\n25 percentage in rural areas. On average, during FY14 -FY18 social security system allocation reveals three \\npatterns with respect to locational allocation: (i) 49% o f social security sche mes serve  both rural and urban \\nareas (including government pensions); (ii) 47% of the social security schemes go exclusively to rural areas; \\nand (iii) Only 4% of the social security schemes exclusively to urban areas. Outcomes of this allocation \\nmismatches  are: (i) coverage is lower than poverty in urban areas (i.e. 10.6% covered against poverty rate \\nof 18.9%); (ii) coverage is greater than poverty in rural areas with 34.5 per cent coverage for 26.4 per cent \\n(2016) poor population. Addressing SP gaps in urb an areas will be critical moving forward especially \\nconsidering the concentrated economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on urban areas. Findings from \\nthe GED completed research on the urban needs of the poor in relation to social protection point out tha t a \\nrenewed and dedicated emphasis on urban social protection planning is required, especially considering the \\ncontinuing urban migration trend in the country. A major recommendation coming out of that work is for \\nadopting an inclusive urban sector policy in line with the NSSS provisions15.  \\n                                                     \\n15  Social Security Policy Support (SPPS) Programme (2019) ‘Diagnostics for Urban Poverty and the Social Security Needs of \\nthe Urban Poor in Bangladesh’ in General Economics Division (GED), Bangladesh Planning Commission, Ministry of \\nPlanning, G overnment of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. A Compendium of Social Protection Researches.    \\n \\n716 \\n Resource Allocation  \\nSocial Protection Budget Stable but Low:   Bangladesh has been spending about 2.2 per cent of her GDP \\nin the social safety net system (including social empowerment). The allocation is less than 2.2 per  cent of \\nGDP when the government employee  pension scheme component is excluded. Key government plans (i.e. \\nNSSS, Sixth Five Year Plan, Seventh Five Year Plan and SDG financing strategy) called for scaling up of \\nthe social protection budget to around 2.5 per cent  and 3 per cent of GDP.  \\nInadequate Generosity:  Average transfer amount to beneficiary (also known as generosity) has been low \\nin Bangladesh. Estimated average transfer amount which was less than BDT 332 per month in FY 2015 \\nincreased to about BDT 59 5 per month in FY 2019 in nominal term. When compared with the national \\npoverty lines, these transfer amounts appear inadequate to have more meaningful impact on the poverty \\nsituation of the beneficiaries. For instance, estimated upper poverty line for 201 8 is TK 2,025 per person \\nper month. Thus, the transfer amount of TK  595 constitutes only 29 cents  of the need of a poor or vulnerable \\nperson.  \\n14.2.2 Social Protection Strategy of Seventh Plan  \\nThe Seventh Plan emphasizes on the successful implementation of  the National Social Security Strategy \\n(NSSS) adopted in June 2015 since the successful implementation of it would provide a strong basis for \\nBangladesh to extend proper social protection to its poor and vulnerable population. The Seventh plan \\nopined that ‘the Proposed reforms will be instrumental in eliminating leakages, improving targeting, \\nincreasing the average value of the transfers, lower ing the risks faced by the poor a nd vulnerable population, \\nreducing  poverty, help ing to  reduce income inequality an d build social capital’. In addition, the changing \\ndemography of the country will have to be considered to ensure that supply and demands needs along \\nparticular services, such as health,  are being matched.  \\nBox 14.1: Brief Overview of NSSS  \\nNSSS provides a s ound strategy that defines the various life -cycle risks faced by poor and vulnerable population \\nand seeks to mitigate those risks by instituting a well -designed income transfer system that reaches the poorest and \\nmost vulnerable segment of the population ( the young children, school going children, vulnerable women, the \\nelderly and the physically challenged). The NSSS is inclusive of all population irrespective of race, religion, \\nprofession, location or ethnicity. It seeks to modernize the Bangladesh social security by combining tax -funded \\nsafety net programmes with contributory social insurance and employment regulations to protect the workers.  It \\nalso seeks to considerably improve the administrative arrangements for social protection programmes by \\nconsolid ating complementary programmes, by strengthening staffing and institutions, by instituting a modern MIS \\nsystem, by replacing food -based transfer payments with cash -based payments using the financial sector based G2P \\n(government to people) system, by introd ucing a grievance redressal ing mechanism and by installing proper results -\\nbased M&E system. These reforms will be instrumental in eliminating leakages, improving targeting, increasing \\nthe average value of the transfers, lower the risks faced by the poor an d vulnerable population, reduce poverty, help \\nreduce income inequality and build social capital (Source: 7FYP ).  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n717 \\n Progress in Social Protection System under the Seventh Plan  \\nIn order to assess the progress of NSSS implementation, GED commissioned a co mprehensive review in \\n2019. The review considered 86 indicators for the progress assessment. The performances have been \\nassessed against four criteria. More specifically, scores assigned to different indicators were used to \\nconsider if they are on-track (i.e. when the performance indicators are fully achieved/operational as \\nspecified in the NSSS and Action Plan); almost on -track  (when significant progress has been made on the \\npre-specified performance indicators but there are some gaps); moderately off -track (when some progress \\nhas been made but implementation is far behind the envisaged performance indicators); and finally, \\nseverely off -track (when very little or no progress has been made). Being consistent with the analysis \\nabove, indicators that are assig ned a full -score of five are considered as ‘on -track’; indicators with a score \\nof four as ‘almost on -track’; indicators with a score of three as ‘moderately off -track’; and indicators with \\na score of either one or two as ‘seriously off -track’. Summary outc ome of the performances are re -produced \\nby life cycle based programmes (as proposed in NSSS, 2015).  \\nFigure 14.2: Implementation Status of Individual Indicators  \\n \\n             Source: MTIR  of NSSS  \\nAccording to the NSSS MTIR, of the 86 performance indicato rs, 26 indicators (about 30 per cent) are on -\\ntrack. A total of 37 indicators (43 per cent) are seriously off -track – i.e. very little progress has been made. \\nMost of the timely implementation has been observed in the reforms related to food security, progr ammes \\nfor elderly, and the persons with disabilities. The reforms related to urban poor saw the least progress. This \\nis because the only indicator envisaged in the NSSS (commissioning a study) was not undertaken during \\nthe period of review. Amongst others,  the programme consolidation also lacks behind its objectives. Out of \\n12 indicators, it only achieved timely implementation of one indicator. There are 8 indicators in which this \\nreform is seriously off -track.  \\n  \\n \\n718 \\n The highest number of reform indicators are c oncentrated across the programmes for working age poor. \\nOut of 28 indicators, satisfactory progress (on -track/almost on -track) has been marked on 10 indicators. \\nThere are still 13 indicators where this implementation seriously lags behind NSSS visions.  \\nThe relatively high proportion of on -track indicators is observed in the reforms related to the G2P and GRS. \\nHowever, these two broad areas also have relatively fewer indicators to be assessed. The highest number \\nof indicators is  concentrated in the thematic  cluster component. Of the 21 indicators, five are on -track while \\nanother 14 are either seriously or moderately off -track. Among others, all indicators for single registry MIS \\nare either moderately or seriously off -track. While six out of four indicators f or strengthening the \\nbeneficiary selection process is seriously off -track. A Single Registry Situation Assessment completed by \\nthe GED reviewed various databases considered for usage in a single registry platform looking at \\noperational readiness. The asses sment suggests that prior to initiating development of a single registry;  \\nseveral supporting databases require improvements first, including both operational functionality and \\nenabling policies. Therefore, it’s important to consider the development of the national household databases \\nthat would comprise a single registry, which will be a priority area in the next developmental period16   \\n14.2.3 Social Protection Strategy for the Eighth Plan  \\nThe main challenge for the Eighth Plan in the area of social protec tion is the successful implementation of \\nthe NSSS since progress in the 7FYP was not satisfactory. The successful implementation of the NSSS will \\nprovide a strong basis for Bangladesh to extend proper social protection to its poor and vulnerable \\npopulation . The proposed reforms will be instrumental in eliminating leakages, improving targeting, \\nincreasing the average value of the transfers, lower the risks faced by the poor and vulnerable population, \\nreduce poverty, help reduce income inequality and build so cial capital. The core elements of the NSSS and \\nassociated implementation challenges are discussed below.  \\nThe Vision for Social Security System  \\nIn the long -term the objective should be to move towards building a Social Security system that is available \\nto all Bangladeshis who are in need of support, providing them with a guaranteed minimum income but \\nalso a comprehensive safety net for those who suffer shocks and crises that may push them into poverty. \\nTherefore, the long -term vision for Social Security is  to: \\n\\uf0b7 Build an inclusive SSS for all deserving Bangl adeshis that effectively tackle  and prevent  poverty and \\ninequality and contributes to broader human development, employment and economic growth.  \\n \\nOver the next five years the aim should be to build the fou ndations of a progressive and inclusive system:  \\n\\uf0b7 Reform the SSS by ensuring more efficient and effective use of resources, strengthened delivery \\nsystems and progress towards a more inclusive form of Social Security that effectively tackles lifecycle \\nrisks,  prioritizing the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. A basic objective for the next \\nfive years should be to seek to eliminate as much as possible the incidence of hard-core/extreme \\npoverty.  \\n                                                     \\n16  Social Security Policy Support (SSPS) Programme (2019) Assessment and Road Map Report: Situation Assessment for \\nEstablishing a National Social Protection Man agement Information System in Bangladesh    \\n \\n719 \\n Proposed Interventions for the 8FYP  \\nInterventions pr oposed for SP during the 8FYP are categorized in three clusters: (i) Social Assistance; (ii) \\nSocial Insurance; and (iii) System improvements  \\nExpansion of Social Assistance  \\nEnhanced SP System Allocation in View of COVID -19 \\nPoverty and vulnerability are proj ected to jump in Bangladesh due to economic slowdown and rise in \\nunemployment in the aftermath of severe onslaught of COVID -19. Poor and vulnerable groups in \\nBangladesh lack savings and resources to fend off crisis like the COVID 19 impact. Addressing the health \\nrisks; and the social and economic perils of the vulnerable population should be the main focus of the \\ngovernment stimulus measures  (Figure 14.3) . Accordingly, the first priority is to provide relief to the \\nCOVID -19 affected families. Thus, the 8FYP  will plan to transfer an additional 2 -3 per cent  of GDP as \\nincome transfer to the poor and vulnerable families in FY2021. This extra funding will be temporary to \\nhelp out the poor and vulnerable families who lost income and employment due to COVID -19. For  the \\nmedium term, the 8FYP will increase current social protection allocation of 1.2 per cent of GDP (excluding \\nthe civil service pension) to about 2.0 per cent of GDP by FY2025.   \\nMother and Child Benefit Programme (MCBP):  \\nBangladesh has made significant  progress in reducing malnutrition during the 7FYP, however, poor \\nmaternal and child nutrition continues to threat healthy child growth, development and economic prospects \\nin adult as well as the nation. The National Social Security Strategy 2015, has a pr ovision to design and \\nimplement Child Benefit Programme based on experiences from existing Maternity Allowance and \\nLactating Mother Allowance Programme. Following the direction of NSSS and its action plan, M oWCA \\nhas already piloted an improved version of b oth programme in 2018 -19 and based on experiences has \\ninaugurated a vision with brand named Mother and Child Benefit Programme on 24th July 2019. The MCBP \\nimplemented by MoWCA targeting poor households with pregnant and lactating women for maximum of \\ntwo c hildren (First and second Children) aged 0 -4 years based on their increased nutritional vulnerability. \\nThe objective of the programme is to ensure adequate access to nutritious diets through the provision of \\nmonthly cash - based transfer (BDT 800) and socia l behaviour  change communication (SBCC) to support \\nhealthy birth outcomes, optimal infant and young child feeding practices and cognitive development to \\nultimately contributing to reduce all forms of malnutrition.  To ensure maximum coverage for eligible \\nhouseholds the MCBP has been further improved through the use of a di gital self -enrolment process. \\nMoWCA is scaling up the MCBP to 66 Upazilas in 2020 -21 and aims to continue the scale up to reach 7.5 \\nmillion households with pregnant women and children aged  0-4 years throughout Bangladesh by 2025. \\nBased on successful implementation the ministry will further scale up the program.  \\nImplementation of NSSS Recommendation on School Stipend  \\nThe primary school pupils and their families throughout rural Bangladesh ar e the main targeted \\nbeneficiaries of the primary education stipend schemes. It is a conditional cash transfer programme. This \\nprogramme is designed to provide cash assistance through a stipend programme to all the eligible primary \\nschool students. The main  purpose of this programme is to increase the enrolment  rate among primary and   \\n \\n720 \\n school aged children, increase the attendance rate completion cycle, survival rates and reduce the dropout \\nrate. The Primary Education Stipend Project (PESP) is being implemente d by the Ministry of Primary and \\nMass Education. The number of beneficiaries of PESP programme was 52.0 lakh (or 5.2 million) in FY \\n2010 and increased to 130.0 (or 13 million) lakh in FY 2018. The budget allocations were BDT 574.84 \\ncrore (or BDT 5,748.4 mi llion) and BDT 1,450 crore (or BDT 14,500 million) respectively in FY2010 and \\nFY 2018. Existing process of implementing this project needs positive intervention for improving efficiency \\nand effectiveness.  \\nFigure 14. 3: Additional Investment Need (Billion B DT and per cent  of GDP)  \\n \\nOne of the recommendations of the NSSS (2015) was to enhance school stipend amount to BDT 300 per \\nstudent per month. This has not been implemented yet. The real value of school stipend amount has fallen \\nsignificantly. Thus, it is proposed to implement the NSSS recommendation during the 8FYP. Considering \\nthat the number of beneficiaries would remain more or less close to 13 million over the 8FYP plan and that \\nthey would be paid BDT 300 per month (which is inflation indexed), the est imated additional cost of the \\nprimary school stipend programmes may range between 0.105 per cent of GDP in FY 2021 to 0.082 per \\ncent of GDP in FY 2025.  \\nInterventions for Adolescent Girls  \\nSchool drop -out and child marriages are very high among adolescent g irls in Bangladesh. Poverty and \\nsecurity have been cited as two major factors for school drop -out and child marriages. Interventions aimed \\nat reducing school dropout and as well as delaying early marriages argued to have long term positive \\nimpacts on morta lity, nutrition status and productivity. Accordingly, large number of pilot projects has  been \\ntried in various countries in Africa and Asia. The outcomes of these interventions have been found positive \\nin terms of delaying child marriages and reducing scho ol drop -out. It has also been argued that the positive \\noutcomes may be results of high cost intervention – which later on was found to be difficult to scale up. In \\nthe case of Bangladesh, according to the available data the following aspects are important in designing \\ninterventions for adolescents’ girls aimed at reducing the drop -out and delaying child marriages : 34.937.440.042.545.10.105\\n0.099\\n0.093\\n0.087\\n0.082\\n0.0000.0200.0400.0600.0800.1000.120\\n0.05.010.015.020.025.030.035.040.045.050.0\\n2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\nPercent of GDPBillion BDT\\nProgramme Investment (Bill BDT) As % of GDP  \\n \\n721 \\n \\uf0b7 Around 33 per cent of the adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19 years) are married, and 18.5 per cent have \\nhad a live birth or are pregnant with their first child.  Thus, targeted groups for this intervention are girls \\nbetween age 10 and 18 or 19.  \\n\\uf0b7 Around 45 per cent of the adolescent girls do not attend school. Therefore, at least two types of \\ninterventions are considered –one for girls attending school bu t susceptible to drop -out and early \\nmarriage; and the other for girls who have already dropped -out of schools and are very much subject \\nto early marriage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Transfer size and types of interventions should be designed in way that does  not create ‘perverse’ \\nincentive. One possible approach is to set the transfer (or enhanced stipend) amount equal to the child \\nbenefit amount (BDT 900 per month) but separated into three components – BDT 300 as stipend; BDT \\n300 for purchasing of hygiene products; and BDT 300 for h ealth -related expenses. Moreover, merit \\ntype interventions such as improved security at the schools, local and community levels as well as \\naccess to safe space groups are of public good types with equal access to all girls aged 10 to 19.  \\n\\uf0b7 Adequate resources  must be allocated for beneficiary selection and subsequent strong monitoring of \\nthe programmes.   \\nConsidering the above aspects, the programme investment for adolescent girls has been estimated. Two \\ntypes of interventions have been attempted – one for ado lescents’ girls who are attending schools and other \\nfor adolescents’ girls who are not attending schools.  \\nFigure 14. 4: Estimated Investment for Adolescents’ Girls Intervention  \\nSource: GED Projections  \\nInvestment for education intervention should be provi ded by the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education \\n(as part of the proposed increased allocation of 3. 0 per cent of GDP in 8FYP in place of current 2 per cent \\nof allocation), while investment for other interventions should be covered from the social protect ion budget \\nas well as from MoWCA budget. However, government should first undertake a pilot project before scaling \\nit up for the entire nation.  90.093.196.298.099.70.530.48\\n0.44 0.400.36\\n0.000.100.200.300.400.500.60\\n84.086.088.090.092.094.096.098.0100.0102.0\\n2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\nPeecent of GDPMillion BDT\\nYearly investment (BDT million) Yearly investment (% of GDP)  \\n \\n722 \\n The Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme  \\nThe Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme is the large st social safety net programme under \\nthe Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (M oWCA). The long -term objective of the VGD Programme \\nis to improve socio economic conditions of the poverty prone and distressed rural women of Bangladesh, \\nso that they can ov ercome food insecurity, malnutrition and financial crisis as well as the lack of social \\ndignity. About 10,40,000 direct ultra -poor participants across the country receive monthly food ration (30 \\nKg, Rice) for the household and a development support service s (inclusive of life skills and income \\ngenerating skills training, savings and access to credit) for a cycle (Two Years) across the country. The \\nministry would further increase the coverage of the program  \\nExpanding Programmes for Disabled Citizen  \\nAlmost 8  to 9 per cent  of the population in Bangladesh has been suffering some sort of disability. Disability \\nprevalence has also been found for different stages of life cycle. However, prevalence rate increases with \\nage. Moreover, almost 1.5 per cent  of the popul ation has been diagnosed with a sever disability. A universal \\nscheme invoking higher than average transfer amount should be designed for the sever disables persons. \\nMoreover, the social protection system that could be expanded in Bangladesh for disabled pe rsons is set \\nout in the below chart, focusing on the life cycle schemes.  \\nFigure 14. 5: An Expanded Social Protection System for the Disabled Persons  \\n \\n \\nEach of these pillars of a comprehensive strategy is addressed in turn below.  \\nCare dependency benefit:  A Care Dependency Benefit could be established/  expanded for families caring \\nfor children with disabilities. The programme could focus on children with severe disabilities irrespective \\nof whether or not they are attending school. Once children are on the s cheme, it would not be necessary to \\n  \\n \\n723 \\n recertify them on a regular basis. Children would automatically leave the programme when they reach 19 \\nyears of age and would be transferred to the adult disability benefit, if their disability were assessed to be \\nsuffic iently severe. The absence of recertification would reduce administrative costs and make the \\nprogramme simpler to administer.  \\nAdult disability benefit:  An adult disability benefit should be established or expanded for all those aged \\n19-60 with a severe dis ability. However, once they become eligible to get social pension or other pension, \\nthe adult disability benefit should cease and beneficiaries would be covered by the pension schemes.  \\nUsing the severity rate of 1.5 per cent of total population and consid ering the cost of living index rise in the \\nlast 6 years, a reasonable transfer amount of BDT 3,000 per month has been proposed at 2020 prices. The \\nBDT 3,000 will roughly equal the per person poverty line in FY 2020 and an administrative cost of 10 per \\ncent has also been included to estimate the total programme cost under the 8FYP. The programme cost is \\naround BDT 39 billion. The per cent of GDP cost is small – falling from 0.11 per cent in FY 2021 to 0.06 \\nper cent in FY 2025.  \\nFigure 14. 6: Child Disability Investment (Billion BDT and per cent  of GDP)  \\n \\n    Source: GED  Projections  \\nAllowance for Freedom Fighters  \\nThe Ministry of Liberation War Affairs will continue to implement safety net programmes for the freedom \\nfighters through allocation of monthly allowan ces for the freedom fighters.

The Government is highly sensitive to ensuring the e limination of all kinds \\nof socio -economic discrimination against these groups through legislative and other affirmative actions. \\nThis is a major agenda item for the Government’s broader Social Development Framework. The \\nGovernment will also ensure that the se groups have similar access as the rest of the population to all Social \\nSecurity programmes and to all publicly provided basic services in education, health, nutrition, population \\nplanning, water supply and sanitation. The Government believes that these two strands of public policy are \\nthe best way to support the development of these groups.  \\nThe Government is aware that special efforts will be needed to reach many of the members of this group. \\nThis will involve sensitizing staff of Social Security agenci es as well as relying on local government and \\nNGOs for identifying potential beneficiaries. An effective grievance redressing mechanism will also be \\nhelpful to bring members of these excluded populations into the Social Security network.  \\nSocial Insurance  \\nAlong with improving the social assistance system, it is now time to focus on the other pillar of the social \\nprotection system.  The 8FYP may focus on developing products which may attract a burgeoning affordable \\nmiddle -income class in Bangladesh to buy vari ous types of social insurance aiming at smoothing their \\nconsumption in times of need.  \\nFigure 14.7: A schema tic diagram of social insurance  \\n \\n \\n \\nOld Age  \\n Senior Citizens’ \\n \\nOld age pension  \\nWorking \\nAge  \\nYouth  \\nDisability benefit  \\nEmployment \\n \\nMaternity insurance  \\nSurvivors’ pension  \\nDisability pension  \\nEarly \\nChildhood  \\nSchool  Age  \\nChild disability \\n \\nChild benefit  \\n Survivors’ pension  \\nFamily package  \\nDirect \\nIncome Support  \\nSocial Insurance  \\nUnemployment insurance    \\n \\n725 \\n Insurance for Working Age  \\nLack of decent jobs, and inability to encourage young female workforce to the labour m arket are some of \\nthe key challenges facing the working age group in Bangladesh. Moreover, insurance schemes for the \\nworking age groups are virtually non -existent in Bangladesh. Next generation social protection schemes \\nmust be tailored to address some of these concerns. This may include access of affordable unemployment \\ninsurance schemes for both formal and informal workers; and care services (i.e. for both child and adult \\ncare) to ensure higher participation of female workforce in the labour market.  \\nSome  of the recommendations made by the ILO may also be considered for the working age groups. They \\ninclude: (i) establish systemic linkages between social insurance and employment promotion programmes, \\ne.g. by entailing social insurance registration as a cond ition to access the employment promotion \\nprogrammes. Increase linkages of unemployment insurance benefits with active labour market policies, by \\ndesigning for instance training responding to the needs of beneficiaries; (ii) develop employment promotion \\nprogrammes linking with vocational training and registration to social insurance, targeting specifically \\nyoung unemployed. Reinforce public employment services, in particular career/employment/training \\ncounselling, vocational training and entrepreneurship cou nselling, rather than focusing only on loan \\nprogrammes, notably services adapted to urban and rural youth; and (iii) develop a comprehensive \\nprogramme (that combines training and retraining, counselling for entrepreneurship, career counselling) for \\nreinser tion of differently challenged people due to working injury and occupational diseases.  \\nContributory Pension  \\nBangladesh is still a young country according to the age structure. But it is ageing fast and poised to enter \\nthe official stage of an ageing natio n by 2030. The number of people aged 60 and above may reach over 40 \\nmillion in 2050 from only 10 million in 2020. Thus, each of the next three decades may be associated with \\n10 million additional elderly citizens. The Government of Bangladesh has been comp leting an introduced \\nto universal pension for her elderly citizens. The social pension has experienced impressive expansion in \\ncoverage. However, the coverage is still low compared to the need and the transfer payment seems \\ninadequate. Due to constraints i n fiscal space, it may not be feasible to expand the tax -financed social \\npension to cover every single elderly citizens of the country. Contributory pension schemes need to be \\nintroduced to complement  the social pension schemes. Ensuring participation of t he large pool of informal \\nworkers in the contributory pension schemes may turn out to be a major challenge. The experience of Kenya \\n(Box 14.2) suggests that it may be possible to introduce contributory pension involving the informal sector \\nor informal work ers.  \\nFollowing the example of Kenya, Bangladesh universal pension may be composed of the following four \\nschemes ( Table 14.1).  \\n    \\n \\n726 \\n Table 14.1: Financing Plan for Universal Social Pension  \\nPension Schemes  Coverage and eligible  Regulator  \\nTax Financed Social pe nsion  30% of most vulnerable elderly citizen  Public Sector  \\nContributory Public Sector Pension  0.5%; public sector employees  Public Sector  \\nContributory National Social Security \\nFund (NSSF)  15%; formal private sector employees \\n(mandatory)  Retirement \\nBenefi ciary Authority \\n(RBA)  \\nMbao type contributory Pension Fund  50%; formal private sector employees \\n(Voluntary)  RBA  \\n \\n \\n \\n Box 14.2: Pension Scheme in Kenya  \\nPension schemes in Kenya are both Government -run and private. It composed of tax -financed schemes (such as \\nthe Inua Jamii Senior Citizens’ Grant), contributory schemes such as the National Social Security Fund – NSSF, \\nand the Mbao Pension Plan. The Mbao Pension Plan is an innovative programme, targeted at informal -sector \\nworkers , provides workers with a voluntary mechanism for pooling and investing their savings – established in \\n2009. Officially known as the Blue MSMEs Jua Kali Individual Retirement Benefits Scheme, the Mbao Pension \\nPlan is a private, voluntary savings plan. Alth ough it better suited for the informal sector, it was opened to all \\nKenyans from 2011. It is a flagship initiative of the Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA). As of 2018, the Mbao \\nPension has 100,000 members and a fund value of US$ 1,342,000. The requireme nts for taking part in the Mbao \\nPension Plan are as follows:  \\n1. Applicants must be citizens of Kenya and over the age of 18 years with an ID card;  \\n2. Applicants must register for the scheme by paying a KES 100 ($1) registration fee;  \\n3. Applicants must fill out a re gistration form when they present their national ID card;  \\n4. Applicants must have a mobile phone to enable contributions into their account.  \\n \\nFinancial services infrastructure of the Mbao Pension Plan  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n727 \\n Administrative Reforms of the Social Protection System  \\nProgramme Consolidation  \\nConsolidating Small Schemes:  The NSSS recommended the cons olidation of many small schemes, many \\nled by donors that  do not fit in within the NSSS Life -Cycle and are no longer useful. Very little progress \\nhas happened so far both in terms of consolidation of programmes into core Life Cycle programmes and \\nthe phasin g away of small schemes.  This should be an important priority for the 8FYP to conserve resources \\nand strengthen administrative capacity  \\nConsolidation of Food Transfer Programmes:  There is still a large number of food transfer programmes \\nthat need further  review and consolidation along the lines recommended in the NSSS. The NSSS also \\nrecommended the conversion of food transfers into cash -based programmes including for rural works \\nprogrammes.  Since COVID -19 may increase rural and urban unemployment, conver sion of all food - based \\nwork programmes into cash for work programmes would be a key reform.  \\nExpansion of G2P Coverage  \\nCurrently multiple payment methods are used to transfer funds to the beneficiaries. A study on Payment \\nSystem for Social Protection in 2 017 revealed several disadvantages of the current payment systems. Some \\nof them include: (i) delay in receiving funds; (ii) inconvenient for beneficiaries – time, opportunity, and \\nmoney wise; (iii) added difficulties for old, disabled, sick, mothers with c hild, pregnant mothers; (iv) high \\ntransaction costs  (0 – 2.5%); ( vi) vulnerable to duplication and fraudulent payments; and (vii) risk in cash \\nmanagement. Considering these demerits, Finance Division (FD) has been implementing pilot fund \\ntransfers through G2P. According to FD, the expected benefits of G2P include: (i) direct payment from the \\ntreasury to beneficiaries’ accounts; (ii) timely and regular hassle free delivery of allowances at the doorsteps \\nof beneficiaries at zero cost to them; (iii) provides c hoice for beneficiaries to select according to their \\nconvenience the mode of receiving the allowances – Bank, Mobile Financial Services (MFS), Post offices \\netc.; (iv) prevents leakages in terms of double dipping, duplicates and eliminates ghost beneficiari es; and \\n(v) improves Cash Flow Management for the Government. However, G2P is still very limited in scale as \\nonly a few programmes are included in the G2P pilot. For instance, cash allowances for 11 SSPs are partially \\ndisbursed through G2P. Given its merit s as well as ability to enhance financial inclusion, special attention \\nshould be given to scale it to 60 to 70 per cent of the total SP fund transfer via G2P within the 8FYP. The \\nbenefits of utilizing digital payment mechanism is enhancing efficiency in Ti me, Cost, and Number of \\nVisits which has also been evidenced by a SSPS Programme of GED randomized controlled trial study \\ncompleted in 2019.17. The Study found significant efficiency benefits for beneficiaries using two digital \\npayment mechanisms compared t o the control method of manual bank collection, and opportunities fo r \\nexpanding financial inclusion   \\nBenchmarking Administrative Reforms and Associated Administrative Costs  \\nInternational and national evidences clearly envisaged that allocating adequate res ources for administrative \\ncosts are important for programme success. Administrative resource cost will depend upon proper \\n                                                     \\n17  Social Security Policy Support (SSPS) Programme (2019) Social Security Digital Cash Transfers: Strengthening G2P in \\nBangladesh    \\n \\n728 \\n administrative reforms to improve the delivery of the social protection schemes.  The 8FYP will implement \\nthe following reforms: (i) properly consolidate the multitude of programmes into the core Life Cycle \\nschemes; (ii); develop a proper list of beneficiaries to minimize exclusion and inclusion errors; (iii) develop \\nan adequate MIS system; (iv) develop a proper M&E system; and (v) Furthe r strengthen the Grievance \\nRedressal System (GRS) with online filing of complaints and a time -based follow -up and resolution of \\ncomplaints.  These reforms will entail considerable staff and technology resources and staff training. The \\nassociated costs will  have to be properly estimated and these resources provided to strengthen the \\nimplementation of the NSSS.   \\nStrengthening Processes for Selecting Recipients of Social Security Schemes  \\nA key administrative reform is to ensure that transfers go to the right people. Yet, identifying the right \\npeople is a common challenge faced by developing countries, in particular when using poverty -based \\nselection processes. Poor targeting results in high exclusion (exclusion error denotes sum of actual poor \\nwrongly classifi ed as non -poor as a proportion of the total poor) and inclusion errors (leakage which is also \\nknown as ‘inclusion error’ is the sum of actual non -poor incorrectly classified as poor as a proportion of \\nthe total poor). Existence of high exclusion and inclus ion errors demonstrate an inefficient social protectio n \\nsystem. Moreover, due to the  high levels of under coverage and leakage, social protection spending unable \\nto attain the desired impacts on poverty and inequality.  \\nTo address the inefficiency problem,  the government has undertaken a project to develop a comprehensive \\ndatabase of all households (known as the National Household Database – NHD) and use a selection method \\nbased on ‘Proxy Means Test (PMT)’ model to improve the selection of poor and thereby reduce the high \\nlevel of exclusion and inclusion errors. The prime objectives of the PMT model as stated in the NHD project \\n(2019) are to: (i) maximize coverage of the poor and vulnerable population given limited budget; (ii) make \\nthe system fully consiste nt with the goal of universal coverage of the poor; and (iii) address the key \\nchallenge to build a cost effective system to identify the poor.  \\nGiven the inability of the PMT model to improve the beneficiary selection at lower level of coverage, it has \\nbeen advocated by social protection practitioners to adopt universal coverage of the beneficiary. However, \\nin the context of Bangladesh, where fiscal space is low and shrinking, it may be argued that universal \\ncoverage may not be tenable. But universal covera ge may be possible for some programmes (such as child \\nbenefit, and social pension etc.) involving public provision (i.e. tax financed benefit) and private \\ncontribution (i.e. social insurances such as family package, unemployment insurance and contributory \\npension etc.). There is also a fiscal and administrative case for potentially pursuing such a strategy. \\nFurthermore, universal coverage may be considered for some specific regions. Against these backdrops, \\nthe cumulative consumption function of all househo lds using HIES 2016 has been compared against the \\nvarious poverty lines to determine who should be covered under the child focused social protection \\nprogrammes in Bangladesh. The comparison of the cumulative consumption function derived using HIES \\n2016 dat a against various poverty lines suggests that using the NSSS definition of poor and vulnerable \\npopulation (UPL x 1.25), some 50% of the population was poor and vulnerable in 2016. If the definition is \\nwidened to include vulnerable people who consume at UPL x1.5, then the proportion of vulnerable \\npopulation rises to 60%, suggesting that only around 40 per cent of the households are in a position to \\nwithstand shocks of various types (Figure 14. 7).    \\n \\n729 \\n Figure 14. 7: Distribution of Consumption across  Households by Poverty Lines in 2016  \\n \\n Source: based on HIES 2016  \\nEstablishing a Results -Based Monitoring and Evaluation System for the Social Security Programmes  \\nContinuous result based monitoring will  be needed to improve delivery processes, document results, inform \\npolicymakers about the effectiveness of alternative approaches, and mobilise political support for \\nsustainability and expansion of the programmes that comprise the strategy.  \\nCoordinating Role of Agencies/Ministries for M&E:   M&E activities will be divided  into three components. \\nImplementing Ministries/Divisions will monitor progress of their respective programmes; IMED will be \\nresponsible for overall monitoring and evaluation of implementation of projects/programmes. Lastly, the \\nrole of GED would be to pre pare and update a results framework using a matrix of specific indicators and \\nevaluate performance of NSSS implementation in a holistic approach. The GED will also be responsible \\nfor overall coordination of the M&E framework and dissemination of the evalua tion results. The Central \\nMonitoring Committee (CMC) headed by the Cabinet Secretary will play a critical supervisory role. In \\nparticular, the role of the CMC will be performance review of social security programmes, inter -ministerial \\ncoordination, trouble  shooting and crisis mitigation.  \\nDissemination and Use of M&E Results:  Emphasis on M&E is placed in order to ensure that best results \\nare obtained from the resources spent on Social Security. It is therefore important that there are well -\\nspecified mechanis ms for disseminating the findings of the M&E. All information needs to be readily \\navailable to stakeholders, in this case the beneficiaries, ministries and NGOs involved. The beneficiaries \\nshould be aware of the programme outcomes and the eligibility crite ria for each programme. This could be \\nbest achieved by putting all monitoring data and evaluation results on the websites of the implementing \\nministries as well as the website of the Planning Commission. All evaluation reports would be shared with \\nthe Cabi net and responsible Parliamentary Standing Committee. GED will be responsible for reporting to \\nthe Cabinet and subsequently GED and Cabinet Division will report to the Parliamentary Standing \\nCommittee the types of actions taken to respond to the findings o f the evaluation reports.  010002000300040005000600070008000900010000\\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1BDT/moth/per personUPL x 1.25\\nUPL\\nVulnerable population in Bangladesh in \\n2016  \\nUPL x   \\n \\n730 \\n A Dedicated Survey on Social Protection System in Bangladesh  \\nHIES has incorporated a section on social protection system covering 30 large programmes since 2005 with \\nan aim to generate data to assess the performance of the social protection system. HIES has been a good \\nsource of information for assessing the social protection system. However, the extent of exclusion and \\ninclusion errors are quite large according to the HIES social protection data base. Moreover, a deeper \\nanalysis o f HIES social protection data base reveals existence of large numbers of outliers – perhaps \\ninfluencing high exclusion and inclusion errors and related other deficiencies of the social protection \\nsystem. Discussion with DSS officials also transpired that t hey are skeptical on the extent of high exclusion \\nand inclusion errors emerged out of HIES data and pointed to unsatisfactory data collection methods \\nadopted by the HIES field enumerators. Considering the importance of a comprehensive data base for the \\nsocial protection system, a dedicated survey of social protection system may be carried out under the aegis \\nof the General Economics Division. Moreover, this should be supplemented by a comprehensive review of \\nthe administrative arrangements of the major 15 t o 20 social protection schemes covering cash, CCT, food \\nand livelihood programmes.  \\n14.3 FOOD SECURITY  \\nThe Government of Bangladesh, through policies and plans, has consistently kept a high level of \\ncommitment to the goal of achieving food security and nutritio n for its people. The SDGs call upon to end \\nhunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. To this \\nend, the government has prepared the National Agricultural Policy 2018. The major objective of the policy \\nis to ensure food security and socio -economic development through productivity of crops, boosting \\nproduction and raising farmers’ income, diversifying crops, producing safe foods and developing a \\nmarketing system profitable for agriculture. National Food a nd Nutrition Security Policy 2020 has already \\nbeen published  to cover the period until 2030 in consistence with the SDGs. This Plan should also be an \\nimportant way forward to tackle the COVID -19 -induced challenges while keeping Bangladesh on track to \\nmain tain its food security target  \\nThe outbreak of the COVID -19 pandemic is causing unprecedented  disruptions in economic activities \\nincluding those associated with agricultural supply chains and production, adversely affecting livelihoods \\nand income of poor an d low -income households, most of who are in the informal sector, potentially raising \\nthe concern about food insecurity. Generally, after a major global crisis, food security becomes a prominent \\nissue for low and middle -income countries as many agricultural  exporting countries impose indiscriminate \\nrestrictions on trade in farm products with the objective of maintaining domestic supplies. The World Food \\nProgramme (WFP) predicts  that the COVID -19 pandemic could see more than a quarter of a billion people \\nsuffering worldwide from acute hunger by the end of the year. In this backdrop, ensuring food security \\nshould prominently feature in the strategies for the agriculture sector development under the 8th Five Year Plan.  \\n14.3.1  Challenges of Food Security and Nut rition  \\nMaintaining agricultural growth: Bangladesh emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. \\nAgriculture works as the driving force in the socio -economic development in the country. Overall, \\nagricultural growth is subject to a lot of fluctua tions. It needs to be stabilized at around 4% to maintain a \\nyearly GDP growth of greater than 8 per cent. The composition of agricultural GDP is changing from crop -  \\n \\n731 \\n based to non -crop sectors with the process being slow. The slow and fluctuating growth of ag ricultural GDP \\nremains a matter of concern. To feed the increasing population, the growth needs to be stabilized at a higher \\nrate. The challenges of agricultural growth and diversification for crop and non -crop sectors have been \\ndiscussed in detail in Chap ter 5, Part 2 of the Plan Document.   \\nEnsuring social access to food: Access to food has three dimensions: economic, physical and social. \\nEconomic access largely depends on income, price and the resultant purchasing power. Lack of purchasing \\npower inhibits  access to food by the poor people. Peoples’ access to food may also be physically constrained \\ndue to the breakdown of transport infrastructures (as a result of, for instance) severe natural disasters. Other \\nfactors  can also disrupt the smooth supply of fo od to some specific locations.  \\nThe steady growth of per capita income and moderate decline in poverty over the past years has not been \\nassociated with any appreciable changes in income distribution situation in the country. The overall Gini \\ncoefficient ros e from 0.451 in 2000 to 0.483 in 2016 indicating that income distribution worsened over the \\npast years. According to HIES data, between 2010 and 2016, income accruing to the bottom 5 per cent of \\nthe households declined from 0.78 per cent to 0.23 per cent, while the corresponding share by top 5 per \\ncent households increased from 24.6 per cent to 27.9 per cent. The overall income inequality is a matter of \\nconcern for ensuring food security and needs serious policy attention. The spending on social safety net \\nprogrammes (SSNPs) to improve food security of the poor and vulnerable has increased although there are \\nissues of high targeting errors in beneficiary selection, and many poor and vulnerable households, \\nparticularly in urban areas remain outside the safety  net. The importance of social security coverage for \\nensuring social access to food for the vulnerable population has become more prominent in the aftermath \\nof the COVID -19 crisis.  \\nPublic food distribution has historically played an important role in impr oving food security of the poor. \\nPublic food distribution through Open Market Sale (OMS) and Fair Price Card (FPC) increased \\nsignificantly over the years. However, the government faced problem in its food operations due to \\ninadequate storage facilities. Th e government has therefore taken initiatives to expand and improve food \\ngrain storage facilities by building additional high -quality modern storage facilities.  \\nChallenges of ensuring dietary diversity: Dietary diversity is important for improving the nutri ent \\nadequacy of diets for better health. Rice is the main cereal consumed. While its consumption, as mentioned \\nabove, has fallen, it is still closer to the desirable norm of intake. Data from the HIES reports show that the \\nnational consumption of cereals w as 64 per cent of daily energy intake per capita in 2016 – down from 70 \\nper cent in 2010. The target consumption of cereals in the per capita energy intake is 60 per cent. The \\nconsumption of nutrient -dense foods such as meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables in creased over the past years. \\nNutrient density helps in closing the nutrient gap in the diet. Consumption of fruits and vegetables, \\naccording to the HIES 2016, is 203 grams which is about half of the WHO/FAO recommendation of 400 \\ngrams/person/day.  \\nDietary d iversity among women of reproductive age is very critical. The minimum dietary diversity score \\n– a proxy for micronutrient adequacy in their diet - shows that just 46 per cent of women had the minimum \\ndietary score in 2015. From 2016, a new indicator calle d the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women \\n(MDD -W) is in use. A target has been set for achieving 75 per cent of MDD -W by 2030. The monitoring \\nof progress suggests that Bangladesh is not on track to achieve the dietary diversity target. From 2011 to   \\n \\n732 \\n 2014, t he proportion of women achieving minimum dietary diversity has remained unchanged at around \\n29%, and from 2014 to 2015 it increased to 31 per cent (FPMU, 2019). Comparison of the actual \\nconsumption data with the data on Desirable Dietary Pattern indicates significant gap for major food items. \\nThe supply and consumption of nutrient dense foods need to be increased for bridging the nutrient gap. To \\nthis end, policies need to address and enhance nutrient density and diet quality for augmenting dietary \\ndiversit y of people.  \\nRapid urbanization:  Bangladesh has seen urbanization taking place at a rapid pace. In 1974, only 9 per \\ncent of the total population was living in urban areas, while in 2018 the corresponding figure reached about \\n37 per cent. One salient featu re of urbanization in Bangladesh is that it took place in an unplanned manner \\nand consequently a large number of the growing urban population became slum dwellers.  Urbanization is \\nalso associated with lifestyle change of people involving lesser degree of heavy work and changes in food \\nhabit. Thus, while the battle against under nutrition continued to prevail, the problem of obesity and \\nlifestyle -related illness have become a serious challenge.  \\nFood safety, food adulteration and quality of processed food:  Unhygienic practices in food handling \\nare a commonplace in Bangladesh. Countless restaurants, roadside small food vendors, fast -food outlets, \\netc. are cooking, baking and processing food stuffs in unhealthy environments. Along with this, adulterated \\nfood now acts as a serious health hazard threat. Contamination of food with chemicals in most cases starts \\nwith residual effect of inputs used for crop production. Farmers intentionally or unintentionally use \\noverdose of insecticide, pesticide and fertilizers d ue to lack of knowledge and awareness. This practice is \\nespecially harmful for fresh fruits and vegetables. For livestock and fisheries products, chemical residues \\nfrom other industrial wastes are alarming as they affect feed, fodder, water, medicine and m any others. \\nBesides, excessive and illegal use of preservatives, artificial ripeness, growth hormones, colours, etc. make \\nthe food stuffs dangerous for public health safety affecting millions of consumers.  \\nFood chain contamination by heavy metals is also an alarming concern for food safety because of their \\npotential accumulation in bio systems  through contaminated water, soil and irrigation water. The major \\nsources of heavy metal contamination in soil are industrial discharge, fertilizers, contaminated irr igation \\nwater, fossil fuels, sewage sludge and municipality wastes, etc. (Islam, 2013). Heavy metals are \\nsubsequently taken up by crops from soil. Different types of chemicals, raw materials/ingredients, packing \\nmaterial, animals and birds, insects, rodent s, garbage and sewage, soil, air/dust, water, virus and bacteria \\nand industrial effluents are the major sources of food contamination in Bangladesh. Along with deficiencies \\nin legal provisions and their enforcements in ensuring food safety, there is also a  lack of effective \\ncoordination among several bodies in the regulatory regime. The government has enacted the Food Safety \\nAct 2013 and a Food Safety Authority has been formed. However, a lack of resources and technical \\ncapabilities of the testing authoriti es are major problems.  \\n14.3.2  Objectives and Strategies for Food Security and Nutrition in the 8th Plan  \\nFood and nutrition security exists when “all people at all times have physical, social and economic access \\nto healthy and nutritious food, which is co nsumed in sufficient quantity and quality to meet their dietary \\nneeds and food preferences, and is supported by an environment of adequate sanitation, health services and \\ncare, allowing for a healthy and active life” (CFS 2012).  The development vision of the 8th plan for the \\nfood security and nutrition section is aligned with the National Food Policy 2006, Food Safety Act 2013,   \\n \\n733 \\n Second Country Investment Plan (Nutrition -sensitive Food Systems) [2016 -2020] , Food and Nutrition \\nSecurity Policy 2020, and the SD Gs. The goal of 8th Five-Year Plan is to improve the food and nutrition \\nsecurity status to the level needed to achieve the FNS -relevant SDG targets and fulfil other related national \\nand international commitments by 2030, improving public food procurement, increasing food storage \\ncapacity and modernization. The specific objectives of the 8FYP are to:  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensure availability of safe and nutritious food for healthy diets; ensure access to safe and nutritious \\nfood at an affordable price.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance the demand for and consumption of healthy and diversified diets for achieving nutrition \\nimprovements; promote interventions to improve dietary diversification to ensure nutrient \\nadequacy among women in reproductive age, especially among adolescent girls, and young \\nchildren  using existing entry -points and multiple community and sectoral platforms.  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase access to nutrition -sensitive social protection and safety nets across life cycle with a focus \\non vulnerable groups and regions  and strengthen promotion of nutrition through  social protection \\nand safety net programmes as well as establishing referral systems between programmes and \\nservices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and support innovative approaches to support programmes (e -vouchers for diverse foods, \\ntele messaging, e -training, etc.)  \\n\\uf0b7 Accelera te nutrition -focused agricultural diversification while continuing to impro ve the \\nproductivity of cereals e nhancement and conservation of nutrients in post -harvest storage, \\ntransformation and distribution.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and improve modern facilities for food sto rage along with increasing capacity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen multi -sectoral food and nutrition security governance, coordination and partnership for \\neffective policy implementation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and improve ICT -based public food procurement, storage and distribution system  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the  coordination mechanism for a comprehensive national level food safety system \\nincluding the establishment and operation of national codex committee.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthen the capacity of food testing situation by establishing BFSA reference lab and imp roving \\nother public laboratories.  \\n\\uf0b7 Explore Public -Private Partnership in case of large -scale investment to introduce modern food \\nmanagement system.  \\n\\uf0b7 Formulate and implement a  comprehensive National Strategy/Policy for reduction of food loss and \\nwaste . \\nSusta ining agricultural growth and developing nutrition sensitive agriculture:  In line with the \\nPerspective Plan 2041, the 8FYP intends to enhance agricultural production and ensure food and nutrition \\nsecurity for all. In order to feed the growing population su staining agricultural growth and diversification \\nfrom the mono -crop production activities are important. The strategies for crop and non -crop sectors for \\nsustaining and improving agricultural growth and promoting diversification are discussed in the crop a nd \\nnon-crop sections later in this chapter.  \\nNutrition sensitive agriculture and food -based approaches are sustainable strategies for eradicating hunger \\nand malnutrition including micronutrient deficiencies. Such strategies including food production, dieta ry \\ndiversification and food fortification ensure sustainable food and nutrition security, dietary improvements   \\n \\n734 \\n and dealing with micronutrient deficiency (FAO 2014). Food based strategies promote production of \\nmicronutrient -rich foods such as vegetables, fr uits, fish and meat. Vegetable production and consumption \\nis the most direct and low -cost method for most of the rural and urban poor to increase micronutrients in \\ntheir diets. Leafy vegetables and tomatoes are important sources of vitamins, particularly v itamin A. \\nBangladesh adopted advanced technologies for bio -fortified agriculture. The first bio -fortified rice variety \\ncalled BRRI Dhan 62 (enriched with zinc) has been released. This rice is capable of fighting diarrhoea  and \\npneumonia -induced childhood de ath and stunting. Presently almost 60 per cent of the marketed edible oils \\nare fortified with vitamin A (FPMU, 2014). Agricultural research will be enhanced further to promote \\nnutrition sensitive food production.  \\nEnhancing purchasing power of people and i mproving employment and income: Increasing \\npurchasing power and enhancing employment and income involve three broad strategies namely transitory \\nshock management, employment generating income growth and targeted food assistance programmes. The \\nmeasures to accomplish the objectives would include special measures for disaster mitigation in agriculture, \\nincreased supply of food through market and public distribution and investment in employment generation \\nactivities. An important way of increasing purchasing p ower of people is to expand rural non -farm \\nemployment opportunities. The Bangladesh economy has undergone remarkable structural changes over \\nthe past decades. Expansion of rural transport infrastructure, electricity and telecommunication facilities is  \\nthe prerequisites for rapid expansion of non -farm activities in rural areas. In designing policies for rural \\nnon-farm employment, female workers need to be given priority in the participation of non -farm activities. \\nTo achieve this desired objective, opportuni ties for women will have to be created through both public and \\nprivate initiatives.   \\nDeveloping more inclusive and nutrition sensitive social protection: Under this initiative, the \\neffectiveness, targeting and content of social safety net programmes are i mproved including by \\nstrengthening nutrition education and promotion to provide better protection of different vulnerable groups. \\nThis is done through the following sub -programmes: (i) expand and strengthen safety net programmes for \\npoor and vulnerable gro ups across the lifecycle, (ii) expand and strengthen programmes for people living \\nin vulnerable and disadvantaged geographical areas, and (iii) introduce nutrition sensitive social safety net \\nprogrammes including food fortification  and nutrition promotion . Social safety net spending has two \\ncomponents: social protection and social empowerment. The importance of social safety nets and strategies \\nfor strengthening the coverage of social protection are discussed in the relevant chapter of this document. \\nFor ex ample , the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education provide fortified biscuits with vitamins and \\nminerals to pre -primary and primary school children in high poverty prone areas. The programme also \\nincludes learning package for children, and other neighbourin g people for vegetable gardening, health care, \\nnutrition and hygiene. The school meal programme has been initiated in few upazilas for ensuring nutrient \\nfood for the children which will be rolled out nationally. In order to make public food distribution sy stem \\nmore nutrient sensitive, efforts will be made to offer micronutrient -fortified food grains in the open market \\noperations and through the safety net channels. The Government in collaboration with development partners \\nand the private sector is introduci ng fortified  rice (called pushti chal) for reducing micronutrient deficiency.  \\nEnsuring food safety through food chain: This will be a priority issues for Bangladesh in the coming \\nyears. For adulteration, apart from an economic motive, lack of awareness ca n also act as a major driver. \\nOn the production side, therefore, awareness building Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) among the \\nfarming households will be crucial so that production practices can improve the quantity, diversity, and   \\n \\n735 \\n nutritional quality of  the produce. The related policies would not be focused on just the rate of growth, but \\nalso the quality of growth. Well -developed agricultural value chains through institutional innovations like \\ncontract farming can reduce the risk of contamination or adu lteration through agreements on quality \\nstandards. Contract farming can be institutionalized with necessary stipulation of provisions in the contracts \\nto protect the interests of the contracting parties including the smallholder farmers. Appropriate policy  \\nsupport will be provided by the public authority in this regard. Agribusiness firms often also agree to support \\nfarmers through a variety of services, such as input supply, extension advice, and transportation of produce to \\ntheir premises. It is essential  to increase surveillance on different market actors to promote food safety attributes.   \\nEnacting of appropriate laws and introduction of proper monitoring systems require coordination among \\nthe authorities responsible for ensuring food safety. An integrat ed view and related operational procedures \\nare necessary for ensuring food safety so that a framework combining laws and regulations including \\nstandards, food safety management, inspection and enforcement services can be made effective. \\nImplementation of r egulations also requires quality food testing facilities. Mobile laboratories could be \\nhelpful with adequate supply of technicians and testing kits to run those laboratories. The BSTI laboratories \\nalone may not be enough. There should also be central food testing facilities at least in every divisional \\ncity. Institutions particularly those with various mandates on food safety should be allocated adequate \\nbudgetary provisions for their activities.  \\nThe Parliament of Bangladesh passed the Food Safety Act 2013  under which the Bangladesh Food Safety \\nAuthority (BFSA) was constituted to strengthen collaboration among inter -ministerial and inter -agencies \\nfor ensuring food safety and food control. The government also constituted 64 District Pure Food Courts \\nand 6 Me tropolitan Pure Food Courts in 2015. Considering risk -based inspections and determining safety \\nstandards, the BFSA has drafted the following regulations: (1) Food Safety (Sample Collection, Test and \\nAnalysis) Regulation 2015, (2) Food Safety (Contaminants,  Toxins, and Harmful Residues) Regulation \\n2015, (3) Food Safety (Food Additives) Regulation 2015, (4) Hygiene Preservation and Preparation of Food \\nRegulation 2016, (5) Labelling  of Packet Food Regulation 2016, Bangladesh Food Safety Authority Service \\nRegul ations 2016 and (7) Bangladesh Food Safety Authority Service Rules 2016 (FPMU 2017). Effective \\nimplementation of the Bangladesh Food Safety Act will be accelerated after finalization of these regulations \\nand rules.  \\nIncreasing storage capacity and moderniza tion:  To ensure quick response and delivery mechanism, food \\nstorage capacity needs to be strengthened. Modernization, mechanization, vertical and bulk storage with \\nmodern weighing and handling etc. are inevitable for the development of nutrient -sensitive f ood storage. \\nDuring the 8th Plan, the Ministry of Food has set the target to increase the storage capacity up to 3.7 million \\nMT by 2025. The following activities will be undertaken for to strengthen public food distribution systems:  \\n\\uf0a7 Increase shelf life an d maintain quality: need modernization, mechanization, vertical and bulk storage.  \\n\\uf0a7 Reduce use of land: promote vertical storage in place of flat go downs   \\n\\uf0a7 Reduce cost of handling and storage: bulk and vertical storage with modern bagging, weighing and \\nhandl ing equipment.  \\n\\uf0a7 Increased storage capacity with drying system in the intensive production zone for the farmers  \\n\\uf0a7 Increase storage capacity in disaster -prone areas to boost response capacity.  \\n\\uf0a7 Develop storage to cater for the need for nutrition interventions fo r the storage of fortified food.    \\n \\n736 \\n \\uf0a7 Develop food storage equipped with ICT to update and quick sharing of data and information on \\ntransactions and be equipped with supply/production management applications.  \\n\\uf0a7 Maintain Buffer stock and ensure access to food and nutrition security to the poor and vulnerable \\ngroups.  \\n \\nThe Directorate General of food (DG Food) currently owns seven silos and 3,081 flat conventional go \\ndowns  of which some are unusable. About 75 per cent of unusable go downs  have already been rehabilita ted \\nand the rest are in the process of rehabilitation.  With a view to constructing eight  modern steel silos having \\ncapacity of 5.35 Lac MT, the government is implementing the Modern Food Storage Facilities Project, \\nfinanced by the World Bank.  \\n14.4 DISASTER MANA NGEMENT    \\nBangladesh remains one of the most disaster -prone countries in the world, experiencing storm surges, \\nfloods, tropical cyclones, and droughts. As indicated earlier, it has also been rated 7th most vulnerable on \\nthe Climate Risk Index in 2019. Mor eover, Bangladesh’s hydro -geological features substantially enhance \\nits vulnerability to disasters and climate change, as 88 per cent  of the country’s landmass consists of a \\nfloodplain. Also, due to the Ganges -Brahmaputra -Meghna (GBM) river basin, this reg ion must drain over \\n92 per cent  of the monsoon rainfall runoff generated in the combined catchment, within only 4 and a half \\nmonths (June to mid -October). During the peak of the monsoon, neap tides are high enough to penetrate \\ncoastal plains, and owing to an inverted funnel -shaped shoreline, and in the path of storms and surges from \\nthe Indian Ocean, the country remains vulnerable to cyclonic disasters. Flood modelling has also indicated \\nthat the total flood -affected area will increase between 2020 and 2050 , while the inundation area due to \\nclimate change will increase by 6 per cent  in the decade following 2030, and 14 per cent  in the decade \\nfollowing 2050, compared to a base year of 2005. Figure 14. 8 offers a graphical depiction of all extreme \\nflooding even ts between 1954 and 2013. Advanced modelling of cyclone storm surge impacts under \\ndifferent climate scenario on potential future inundation zones by 2050 is also provided in Table 14.2.  \\nFigure 14. 8: Inundation Area (in Percentage) by Major Historical Flood s Since 1950s  \\n \\n                          Source: Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB)  \\n  \\n \\n737 \\n Table 14.2: Estimates of Vulnerable Areas ( km2) \\nInundation Depth  2050 Without Climate Change \\n(km2) 2050 with Climate  \\nChange ( km2) % Change  \\nMore than 1m  20,876  23,764  + 14%  \\nMore than 3m  10,163  17,193  + 69%  \\nDasgupta et al. (2014)  \\nThe Government recognizes this proneness to disasters and has (over the years) formulated various laws \\nand plans to develop an effective response capa city to the threat of natural disasters. The Disaster \\nManagement vision of the Government is to reduce the risk of people – especially the poor and the \\ndisadvantaged – to the effects of natural, environmental and human induced hazards to a manageable and \\nacceptable humanitarian level and to have in place an efficient emergency response management system \\ncapable of handling large scale disaster. Some of the notable are mentioned in Table 14.3. In particular, the \\ntwo central laws and action plans that guide p olicies and activities under disaster management are the \\n“National Plan for Disaster Management 2008 – 2015” and “Standing Orders on Disasters 2010”. The \\noverall objective of disaster management is to reduce the underlying risks and to promote the adaption  to \\nthe effects of climate change. This will result in a substantial reduction in the losses, of lives and in the \\nsocial, economic and environmental assets of persons, communities and the country from disasters.  \\nTable 14.3: National Legislations and Polici es related to Disaster Management  \\nPolicy Document  Description  \\nDisaster Management Act, \\n2012  Aims to make disaster management activities coordinated, object -oriented, and \\nstrong in formulating rules to build infrastructure for resilience.  \\nCoastal Zone P olicy, 2005  Acknowledges the importance of ecosystems and biodiversity conservation on \\nthe coasts and supports coastal people in developing sustainable livelihoods.  \\nNational Plan for Disaster \\nManagement, 2008 -2015  Calls for comprehensively addressing DRR  and CAA in all development plans, \\nprogrammes, and policies through assessing climate change risk, emphasizing \\ncommunity -based programmes, building public awareness, improving early \\nwarning systems, and strengthening communication facilities and emergency \\nresponse.  National Adaptation \\nProgramme of Action, 2005  Identifies 15 priority activities for adaptation action, including general \\nawareness raising, capacity building, and project implementation in vulnerable \\nregions, with a focus on agriculture and wate r resources.  \\nNational Disaster Management \\nPolicy 2015   Defines the  national  perspective on  disaster  risk reduction and  emergency \\nmanagement, and to describe the strategic framework, and  national  principles \\nof disaster management  in Bangladesh.  \\nNational P lan for Disaster  \\nManagement 2016 -2020  Updates NPDM 2008 -2015  \\nStanding Order on Disasters, \\n2019  Works to make relevant persons understand and perform their duties and \\nresponsibilities regarding disaster management at all levels.  \\n   \\n \\n738 \\n 14.4.1  Progress during  the 7FYP  \\nThe main goal for disaster management in the 7FYP was to improve the disaster management response and \\ncapabilities building on past successes and the various strategies adopted by the government.  The ‘Vision \\n2021’ identified ‘Effective Disaster Ma nagement’ as one of the key sub -goals and puts emphasis on \\nseasonal flood and drought mitigation, establishing of an effective early warning and evacuation \\nmechanism, and development of a natural disaster insurance scheme to compensate the physical and \\nproperty damage. The Second  Perspective Plan 2021 -2041 , Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 and the National \\nSustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) have provisions and put emphasis to implement NPDM. The \\nlocal level (Upazila) development planning proforma is being re vised by the Local Government Division \\nwhere inputs provided by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief will make it more effective for \\ndisaster risk reduction  \\nSome specific activities that were under taken by the MoDMR  include:  \\n\\uf0b7 Nearly 8 million r ural labours were provided employment under the “Employment Generation \\nProgramme for the Poorest (EGPP)”, which helps to address rural poverty.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government distributed food grains to more than 2.1 million beneficiaries under the \\nHumanitarian Assistance  Programme, while thousands received CI Sheets to develop homes lost \\nin natural disasters like storms.  \\n\\uf0b7 Under the Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) Programme, food grains have been distributed to more \\nthan 8 million beneficiaries.  \\n\\uf0b7 Winter clothes (blankets) hav e been distributed among large group of beneficiaries.  \\n\\uf0b7 Under the FFW/ MFW Programmes, a wide array of projects has been implemented by more than \\n8 million rural labourers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Under the Test Relief (TR) Programme, a wide array of projects was implemented by m ore than \\n10 million rural labourers.  \\n\\uf0b7 In 6 Haor districts affected by flash floods, both food and income support were given to affected \\nfamilies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Among people affected by the hill slides, rice and CI sheets were distributed to rebuild their homes.  \\n\\uf0b7 More th an 200,000 solar panels were installed across rural households and more than thirty \\nthousand solar street lights in rural streets and hat -bazars have been installed.  \\n14.4.2  Objective and Strategies for Disaster Management under  the 8FYP  \\nThe 8FYP will build  on the progress made during the 7FYP, while also internalizing the lessons of past \\nexperiences. These lessons are as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 The Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) is only an Order not an Act, and there is no legal obligation \\nfor the implementers of the SOD. The development of a forward -looking legal framework will \\nfacilitate effective implementation of the actions defined in the SOD. As a result, under the 8FYP, \\nthe Government is committed to develop an effective legal framework that offers the SOD a leg al \\nfooting.  \\n\\uf0b7 The bodies for coordinating the SOD are not sufficiently functional. More training will be offered \\nto enhance the knowledge and skills of the stakeholders. Advanced training, refresher training, on   \\n \\n739 \\n the job training etc. will also be arranged. No work can be done effectively unless the stakeholders \\nare motivated and committed. The Government will also offer greater motivation for better \\nperformance by reshaping the incentives, such as: rewarding the best Union Disaster Management \\nCommittee (UDMC ), rewarding the best UDMC member, rewarding the best volunteer etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Natural disasters cannot be stopped. But the loss of lives, assets and properties can be reduced \\nsignificantly through effective and timely activities for preparedness. The Union Disaster  \\nManagement Committees (UDMCs) are instrumental for reducing disaster risks of the vulnerable \\npeople. The Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) can guide the UDMCs for understanding and \\nperforming their roles and responsibilities. Hence, the Government will mi tigate existing challenge \\nfor better operationalization of SODs through joint collaboration and adopting multi -sectoral \\napproach.  \\n\\uf0b7 Monitoring is very important to track progress, recognizing the challenges and making the \\nnecessary adjustments. To that end, the Government will ensure that the Upazila Di saster \\nManagement Committees (U DMC) remains committed to monitor the activities of Union Disaster \\nManagement Committee (UDMC) regularly and provide proactive support as and when required.  \\n\\uf0b7 The identification, mo bilization and utilization of resources remain  a critical challenge. The \\nGovernment will pay due attention to this concern so that the UDMCs have the adequate resources \\nfor better implementation of the SOD and the Disaster Contingency Plan. Bangladesh has achieved \\nsignificant progress in ensuring 100% sanitation in many of the Unions. One of the underlying \\nfactors for this success is allocating resources at the Union Parishad (UP) budgets for this purpose. \\nSimilarly, the Government will ensure provisions fo r the Disaster Contingency Fund at the Union \\nlevel. This fund will be utilized for awareness activities and developing mechanisms for early \\nwarning, search & rescue, shelter management etc. during disaster period. The Union Disaster \\nManagement Committees ( UDMCs) will also take collective initiatives to generate the Disaster \\nContingency Fund through the mobilization of local resources.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reducing the risks of disaster is a multi -sector endeavour. It is not possible for the Government to \\ntackle disasters alone unless strong collaboration among all the relevant stakeholders, such as the \\nGovernment, the NGOs, researchers, scientists, the civil society, the private sector, the media etc. \\nare established and maintained. Collaborative efforts will be undertaken to st rengthen the activities \\nfor preparedness at all levels and reduce the impact of disasters.  \\n\\uf0b7 Preparedness at the community level works very well where it is part of poverty alleviation \\nprogramme. People living under the poverty line or on very limited income  cannot undertake \\nmeasures for their safety simply because they cannot afford those measures. This is reflected in \\nhow people with limited incomes are forced to opt for risky housing options – built through muds \\nor light materials in the Chittagong Hill Tr acts that are very vulnerable to cyclones and storms. \\nHence, the Government will undertake more investments to increase the safety of such vulnerable \\ncommunities by building/installing infrastructures that are resilient to the impacts of climate \\nchange.  \\n\\uf0b7 Having access to early warnings remains  a challenge and thus, effective institutional measures will \\nbe undertaken to overcome this problem. In particular, the service providers will be supported with \\nresources so that they can perform their duties during di sasters effectively.  \\n\\uf0b7 Outreach is another challenge as greater number of vulnerable people has not yet been reached. \\nThe Government will develop and implement effective measures to scale up measures to mitigate \\ndisasters so that more people are covered.     \\n \\n740 \\n \\uf0b7 The Government recognizes that cooperation of the citizens and advocacy of the media matter in \\nthe reduction of vulnerability, and timely allocation and distribution of resources. Hence, they will \\nbe increasingly integrated in the work on preparedness for d isasters.  \\n\\uf0b7 Development of better societal resilience to disasters require s that we ensure the delivery of basic \\nservices like health, education and water, even during disasters. To this end, the Government will \\ndraw lessons from the international community to develop a more effective Disaster Response \\nFramework (DRF). During the Covid -19 pandemic, some innovation has already been used to \\nensure services like schooling is maintained during the lockdown through televised schooling \\nwhich can reduce the loss of school days.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will invest in Management Information Systems (MIS) to strengthen the \\nmonitoring of climate change and vulnerability to earthquakes, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 Assessments of the risks of disaster and climate change are still at the normative level,  often \\nsuffering from ambiguous quantification. This is making it impossible to estimate the social and \\neconomic value of the disaster and the risks of climate change, the required investments, the losses \\nfrom adverse events. Hence, the Government will for m a technical team  led by Ministry of \\nPlanning,  to undertake a rigorous risk accounting, and determine the baseline, benchmarks and \\ntargets – that will improve Bangladesh’s resilience against natural disasters and various \\nmanifestations of climate change.  \\n\\uf0b7 In order to promote private sector resilience in the country, government will develop disaster and \\nclimate change risk profile of industry sector for risk -informed private investment, developing \\nstrategies  for supply chain resilience to avoid extreme disa ster events and Business Continuity \\nPlanning as a part of disaster recovery in the private sector.  \\n \\nFurthermore, in order to address the losses and damages from natural disasters and climate change more \\neffectively, the following steps will be undertaken:   \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will develop a comprehensive policy on the integration of Disaster Risk \\nReduction (DDR) and Climate Change Adaption (CCA) to address the losses and damages from \\nthe impacts of both extreme events and slow onset processes.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government wi ll establish a policy body under the Ministry of Planning (MoP) and technical \\nbodies at both the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF CC) and the \\nMinistry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), to serve as a knowledge hub and to \\nprovide expertise in DRR and CCA respectively to the Loss and Damage Policy Wing of the MoP. \\nThis will establish a link between Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, and \\nwill help mitigate the losses and damages from natural disasters.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Go vernment will integrate the DRR and CCA in a multi -level institutional framework to \\naddress the losses and damages from both extreme events and slow onset processes under a \\ncommon mechanism.  \\n\\uf0b7 Obtain accreditation for the existing National Funding Entities (NFE) to become National \\nImplementing Entities (NIE) in order to access support from the international funding mechanisms \\n– both within and outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \\n(UNFCCC) – to address losses and damages, includin g through adaptation, mitigation, technology \\nand capacity building.    \\n \\n741 \\n \\uf0b7 Information is especially important in the case of trans -boundary water management. Moreover, in \\ntrans -boundary basins, the exchange of information and the sharing of data between the ripa rian \\ncountries are regarded as a first and essential step towards fostering cooperation and trust. \\nUnfortunately, restrictions in the availability of data and information beyond borders in the riparian \\ncountries of the Ganges basin continue to prevail, and  countries are often hesitant and cautious to \\nshare any kind of hydrological information. Against that context, the Government will develop \\nmore bilateral and multilateral engagements to ensure that the South Asian countries develop a \\nmore coherent strateg y to address both short, medium - and long -term environmental challenges \\nfaced by this region.  \\nFinally, the Government will undertake specific activities to ensure that the management of the environment \\nis sufficiently improved under the 8FYP. These measur es are summarized in Table 14.4.     \\nTable 14.4: Specific Activities for Better Disaster Management under  the 8FYP  \\n  \\n1. Institutionalization of DRR and CCA.  \\n2.

Being one of the top -ranking countries in political empowerment and doing bette r than \\nmany countries in terms of social indicators, Bangladesh has shown promising performance in reducing \\ngender gap. Successful achievement of most of the goals and targets of Millennium Development Goals   \\n \\n742 \\n (MDGs) during the period 2001 -2015 have taken Ba ngladesh miles ahead in this regard. However, it is \\ntime for Bangladesh to turn its attention towards more ambitious targets regarding gender parity, especially \\nthe ones specified in the new set of global goals - i.e. the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs ). The 7FYP \\nwas well -aligned with the SDGs which reflects the Government’s strong commitment in attaining gender \\nparity. The gender strategy of the 7FYP was centred  on strategies and action plans aimed at increasing the \\naccess to resources and opportunitie s for women along with enhancing their capabilities, and reducing \\nstructural and institutional barriers in order to establish equal rights for women. The aim was to “ensure \\nwomen’s advancement as self -reliant human beings and reduce discriminatory barriers  by taking both \\ndevelopmental and institutional measures”. The core targets set in the 7FYP in this regard were:  \\n\\uf0b7 Female to male ratio in tertiary education to be raised from current 70 per cent  to 100 per cent . \\n\\uf0b7 The ratio of literate female to male for age group 20 -24 to be raised to 100 per cent  from the current \\n86 per cent . \\n\\uf0b7 Encourage female enrolment in technical and vocational education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce or maintain the current income inequality of 0.45.  \\n\\uf0b7 Spending on Social Protection as a share of GDP to be increas ed to 2.3% of GDP.  \\n14.5.1  Progress in the Seventh Plan  \\nTo achieve these targets, the 7FYP outlined an implementation plan consisting of 4 strategic objectives: (i) \\nImprove women’s human capabilities; (ii) Increase women’s economic benefits; (iii) Enhance w omen’s \\nvoice and agency; and (iv) Create an enabling environment for women’s advancement. These were backed \\nby providing policy and legal framework and implementing by using gender responsive budgeting (GRB). \\nActions for women’s development were directed t owards seven key areas in 7FYP.  \\n1. Increase access to human development opportunities.  \\n2. Enhance access to and control over productive resources.  \\n3. Increase participation and decision making.  \\n4. Establish conducive legal and regulatory environment.  \\n5. Improve institut ional capacity, accountability and oversight.  \\n6. Increase protection and resilience from crisis and shocks.  \\n7. Promote positive social norms.  \\n14.5.2  Implementation  \\nThe Development Results Framework (DRF) for monitoring the progress of 7FYP identifies 6 key \\nperfo rmance indicators to track the progress in gender and inequality. Table 14.5 shows the progress in \\nthese indicators against the targets for each year in the period 2016 -2020.  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n743 \\n Table 14.5: Progress in Gender and Inequality Indicators  \\nPerformance Indicato rs Baseline \\n(Year)  Target \\nby 2020  Current Status  Source  \\nPercentage of seats held by women at National \\nParliament  20  \\n(2014)  33 20.63  \\n(2019)  http://www.ipu.org/  \\nPercentage of women aged 20 -24 who were \\nmarried before age 18  65  \\n(2011)  30 51.4  \\n(2019)  MICS , BBS  \\nRatio of girls to boys in tertiary education  0.7  \\n(2015)  1 0.72  \\n(2018)  BANBEIS  \\nGender budget as percentage of total budget  27.7 (2014)  30 30.82  \\n(2019*)  MoF  \\nPercentage of female teachers at (a) primary \\n(b) secondary (c) tertiary education  a)57 \\nb)24 \\nc)20 a)70 \\nb)35 \\nc)25 a) 62.25  \\nb) 25.26  \\nc) 26.69 (2018**)  BANBEIS  \\nPercentage of female officers (class -1) \\nemployed in public sector  21  \\n(2014)  25 New data not \\navailable   \\n*Allocation for women compared to total Budget ( per cent ) \\n** University education (26.46); Professional Education (26.92)  \\nSome progress has been made in reducing the percentage of women aged 20 -24 who were married before \\nage 18, as observed by the decline from 65 per cent  in 2011 to 51.4 per cent  in 2019, but significantly off -\\ntrack fro m the target and thus remains a huge challenge. The Government has undertaken some programmes \\nthrough the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) which are aimed at preventing child  \\nmarriage and promoting adolescent health, creating awareness among not only children but also their \\nparents and community leaders regarding the harmful effects of child marriage, dowry and eve teasing. The \\nGovernment has also formulated ‘Child Marriage Prevention Act, 2017’ in this regard.  \\nBangladesh successfully achieved  gender parity in primary and secondary education during the MDG \\nperiod. The completion rate at the secondary level was 63.99 per cent for boys, and 59.81 per cent for girls. \\nThe survival age group rose up from 72.53 per cent in 2017 to 62.38 per cent in 2 018.18 There was \\nsignificant improvement in girls’ secondary education during the past decade. Girls were 47.38 per cent  of \\nenrolled 4.278 million college students in 2018 and 24.23 per cent  of 123,518 college teachers were females. \\nGirls’ participation in graduation level has increased.  Girls’ education in Science, Technology, Engineering  \\nand Mathematics (STEM)  is being promoted. The contents of education are being reviewed to reduce \\ngender bias and to incorporate sexual and reproductive health issues. Safe  drinking water facilities (97.41 \\nper cent) and separate toilets for girls (95.59 per cent) were created in educational institutions. Teachers’ \\ntraining contents now include gender issues.  \\nAlso, the percentage of female teachers in primary, secondary and t ertiary level of education has  increased \\nfrom base year level (Source: BANBEIS). The main challenge for Bangladesh now is to demonstrate the \\nsame zeal towards reducing the gender disparity in tertiary level education. The ratio of girls to boys in \\ntertiary  education was 0.72 in 2019 against showing marginal improvement but far less than the target. The \\nlack of improvement in the ratio indicates the need to introduce innovative and new initiatives on the part \\nof Government to encourage more girls to enrol  into tertiary education. Some of the most noteworthy cause \\nbehind this low participation of women in higher education includes  poverty, early marriage, violence \\nagainst women, and restriction in mobility, lack of adequate accommodation facilities/hostels for  female \\nstudents etc.  \\n                                                     \\n18  Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics, Education Statistics, 2017    \\n \\n744 \\n Adequate financing and human resources are crucial to implement the 7FYP gender strategy and targets. \\nBangladesh has adopted Gender Responsive Budget in 2009, where gender issues are embedded in the \\nMTBF process and emphasis is given on the linkages between a ministry’s stated objectives and activities \\nand advancement of women’s rights. The gender budget report aims to ensure accountability and \\ntransparency of government’s initiatives for women’s advancement. All ministries provide acc ounts of their \\nachievements and challenges in implementing gender -responsive programmes for the fiscal year that show \\ntrends and patterns on national level changes in gender equality and women’s rights. The 7FYP target for \\ngender budget as percentage of to tal budget is 30 per cent  by 2020. In 2019 the gender budget as percentage \\nof total budget was 30.8 – surpassing the target before 2020.  \\nSome other policies have been undertaken by the Government in reflection of its commitment to ensure a \\nsafe and enablin g environment for women. The Government has formulated the ‘Domestic Violence \\n(Protection and Preservation) Rules, 2013’ under ‘Domestic Violence (Protection and Preservation) Act, \\n2010’ to ensure equal rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination i n all spheres of public life and the \\nState. For the development of women and children, the Government has also formulated National Children \\nPolicy, 2011; Children Act, 2013, Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act, 2012, Hindu \\nMarriage Registra tion Act, 2012, Early Childhood Care and Development Policy, 2013, House -maid \\nProtection Policy, 2015, and Child Marriage Prevention Act, 2017. Furthermore, the National Action Plan \\nto Prevent Violence against Women and Children (2018 -2030) and the Nationa l Action Plan to Prevent \\nChild Marriage are being implemented by the Government and civil society organizations. The government \\nis working to curtail sexual harassment in public places, educational institutions and in social media.  \\nThe Government’s strong  commitment towards reducing gender has been reflected in the recent \\nperformances of Bangladesh in gender equality indicators. The Global Gender Gap Report (GGGR) \\nprepared by the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranks countries based on their progress towards cl osing \\nthe gender gap across four thematic dimensions: (i) Economic participation and opportunity, (ii) \\nEducational attainment, (iii) Health and survival, and (iv) Political empowerment. According to the GGGR, \\nBangladesh has been able to close the gender ga p significantly over the last year, ranking top among the \\nSouth Asian countries in gender parity for the fourth consecutive year. Bangladesh has successfully \\neliminated gender disparity in primary and secondary education, as well as reduced the gender gap in \\ntertiary education. The Human Development Report 2016 (UNDP, 2016) recorded that Bangladesh is \\nencouraging female participation in the workforce, with the ambition of bringing the share of women in the \\nworkforce up from 34 per cent  to 82 per cent  by 202 6. Also, Bangladesh is among the top ten performers \\nunder the political empowerment sub -index  of Global Gender Gap Report 2020  (global rank 7th out of 1 52 \\ncountries in the world). Despite the apparent progress in some indicators, there is massive scope for  \\nimprovement in economic and social sectors. Table 14.6 shows the comparative position and score of \\nBangladesh and other South Asian countries in overall gender gap index as well as the sub -indices.  \\n    \\n \\n745 \\n Table 14.6: Comparative performance of South Asian Countries in the GGGR sub -indices  \\nCountry  Overall  Economic \\nParticipation \\nand \\nOpportunity  Educational \\nAttainment  Health and \\nSurvival  Political \\nEmpowerment  \\nRanking  Score  Ranking  Score  Ranking  Score  Ranking  Score  Ranking  Score  \\nBangladesh  50 0.726  141 0.438  120 0.951  119 0.969  7 0.545  \\nMaldives  123 0.646  131 0.518  1 1 147 0.953  115 0.111  \\nIndia  112 0.668  149 0.354  112 0.962  150 0.944  18 0.411  \\nSri Lanka  102 0.680  126 0.558  88 0.988  1 0.98 73 0.193  \\nNepal  101 0.680  101 0.632  133 0.895  131 0.966  59 0.227  \\nBhutan  131 0.635  130 0.544  116 0.954  144 0.960  132 0.082  \\nPakistan  151 0.564  150 0.327  143 0.823  149 0.946  93 0.159  \\nSource: The Global Gender Gap Report 2020 , World Economic Forum  \\nFigure 14.9 captures Bangladesh’s performance in these four indices over the recent  years. Bangladesh has \\nbeen consistently doing well in political empowerment, with women occupying 20. 86 per cent  seats in the \\nparliament. Women’s participation in the National Parliament and local governments has been supported \\nthrough constitutional and legal provisions. In the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, the provision of \\nwomen\\'s reserved seats was increased to 50.  \\nFigure 14. 9: Performance of Bangladesh in GGGR Sub-indices in Recent Years \\n \\n \\nOverall, the analyses of the progress of implementation of 7FYP targets regarding gender equality reveal \\nthat Bangladesh is on track in achieving greater gender parity with a need for increased effort in ensuring \\nsafety of women and children. In Bangladesh, harmful and  discriminatory practices like child marria ge, \\nabandonment, dowry, and gender based violence persist  largely due to practices rooted in the traditional \\nsocial norms that favour  boys over girls. Violence takes place at home, workplace and public places. The \\nfirst law banning acid violence was passed  in Bangladesh in 2002, and the death penalty was introduced \\nlater as punishment for the crime. As a result, acid attacks in Bangladesh fell from 494 incidents in 2002 to \\n59 in 2015. Changing social norms through awareness building and other initiatives ha s been identified as \\none of the key strategies in the 7FYP to reduce harmful practices boosting gender disparity and ensure \\nenhanced capabilities and enabling environment for women.  0 0.5 1 1.5Overall IndexEconomic Participation and OpportunityEducational AttainmentHealth and SurvivalPolitical Empowerment\\nSource: The Global Gender Gap Reports, World Economic Forum2017 2016 2015 2014  \\n \\n746 \\n Nevertheless, despite progress, there is a substantial unfinished agenda.

Dowry demand, wife beating \\nis often accepted by the society due to ignorance. Motivation, awareness and the implementation \\nof laws to a ddress them are great challenges.  \\n\\uf0b7 In spite of all the actions in legal, social, economic and educational measures, child marriage is \\nprevalent. Child marriages happen on the grounds of poverty, insecurity, not having guardians to \\nlook after and such reaso ns.19 Implementation of the Action Plan for Prevention of Child Marriage \\nis a challenge. There are some villages where child marriage and marriage without registration are \\npracticed. Early marriage has to be eliminated to eradicate early pregnancy and for t he development \\nof girls.  \\n\\uf0b7 Universal and affordable health care for all, full vaccination coverage, universal access to family \\nplanning and reproductive health care services, maternity and neo natal care, reduction of maternal \\nmortality, reduction of adolesc ent pregnancy is some of the key areas to address. Ensuring all child \\nbirth under trained personnel and at institutions, reduction of maternal mortality ratio are also \\npriorities high. In addition, SRHR services for adolescents, reduction of healthcare exp enditure, \\nand awareness  against taking services from unqualified persons need to be ensured. Reaching \\nhealth and family planning services to the remote areas are critical.  \\n\\uf0b7 Nationally, 16 per cent of women are underweight, of whom 2 per cent were severely underweight \\nand among adolescent girls 7 per cent were underweight, of whom 1 per cent was severely \\nunderweight. Obesity has also emerged as a new challenge. Micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia , \\nVitamin A deficiency, low rate of breastfeeding are common nu tritional requirements that need to \\nbe addressed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Progress in the area of economic equality is lagging behind. Despite progress during the Seventh \\nPlan, the women’s labour force participation rate still remains low by international norms. When \\nincluded in the labour market, women still face different forms of discrimination. They are more \\nprone to under -employment and wage and occupational gender gaps remain significant. According \\nto GGR 2014, women receive only 57% of the male wages for equal work, and les s than a third of \\nprofessional and technical workers are women. More recent data also suggest wage differential \\nbetween male and female workers. According to LFS (2016 -17) the average monthly incomes from \\nemployment (wage/salary) for females are 95.7%, 77. 9% and 90.2% of their male counterparts at \\nrural, urban and national levels respectively.  \\n\\uf0b7 An inclusive financial system is necessary to enhance women’s access and benefits from secure, \\nsaving, credit, insurance and payment services. A large number of wome n lack access to basic \\nfinancial services and formal finance. According to MoWCA (2020) about 25% of the adults are \\nfinancially excluded. Easier access to finance at a low interest is critical for women’s economic \\nemancipation. Due to fees, collateral, gua rantee, cumbersome rules, and lack of financial literacy, \\nformal financial market is not easily accessible by the poor and women.  \\n                                                     \\n19  Ministry of Women and Children Affairs Annual Performance Assessment Report, 2019 -2020    \\n \\n747 \\n \\uf0b7 Lack of gender responsive working environment including inadequate facilities of child care, \\ntransport, occupational health a nd safety discourage women from accessing the job market. Women \\nworkers in the informal sector have no legal protection against abuse, discrimination, irregular \\nemployment, low wages, and long work hours. Although policy measures are in place and the \\nGover nment has granted women 6 months maternity leave, often this is not followed by the private \\nsector or the NGOs.  \\n14.5.3  Gender Strategy for the 8FYP  \\nIn line with the declaration of the Prime Minister, Gender Equality (GE) has been identified as key to ensu re \\nequity and overcoming barrier to economic growth, poverty reduction and social development. The 8FYP \\nemphasizes on elimination of women and girls’ extreme poverty, ensuring social security, social equity by \\ndeveloping them as resources and harnessing th eir full potential. The gender vision of the 8FYP is that of \\nestablishing “a country where men and women will have equal opportunities and rights and women will be \\nrecognized as equal contributors in economic, social and political development”. The mission  is to ensure \\nwomen’s advancement as self -reliant human beings and reduce discriminatory barriers by taking both \\ndevelopmental and institutional measures. Gender equality and women’s empowerment agenda for the \\n8FYP is based on pursuing strategies and actio ns that not only enhance women’s capabilities and access to \\nresources and opportunities but also address the barriers in structures and institutions and aim at changing \\nsocial norms and protecting their rights are critical to integrate within the plan. Est ablishing monitoring, \\noversight and accountability mechanisms is equally important.  \\nThe framework for women’s empowerment and gender equality comprises of 5 areas of strategic objectives:  \\n1. Improve women’s human capabilities  \\n2. Increase women’s economic partici pation and benefits  \\n3. Enhance women’s voice and remove constraints on women’s agency   \\n4. Enhance/strengthen enabling environment for achieving gender equality  \\n5. Enhance Mother and child benefit programme  \\n\\uf0b7 Improve women’s human capabilities :  This deals with women ’s and girls’ access to health care, life \\nexpectancy, nutrition, reproductive health, education, information, training,  and other services that \\nenable  women to achieve better health and educational outcomes. This also includes family planning \\nservices, wat er supply and sanitation services. These facilitate women to access labour market and in \\ndecision making as well as overcome morbidity, illness, malnutrition and maternal mortality. This also \\nincludes women’s freedom from violence and coercion.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Increase women’s economic benefits:  This related to women’s ability to access to income, job market \\nand economic resources. Women’s access to or control over productive assets, resources, services, \\nskills, property, employment, income, information, technology, fina ncial services, work environment, \\nentrepreneurship, community resources (land, water, forest etc.) ensures economic benefits. Removal \\nof barriers to women’s economic participation and ensuring support services are also critical. Women’s \\neconomic benefits e nhance  status and helps for better living of the family.  \\n \\n   \\n \\n748 \\n \\uf0b7 Enhance women’s voice and agency:   This pertains to  women’s role as decision makers in public and \\nprivate spheres including politics and promotion of their leadership is considered here. Changed \\nattitudes on women’s and girls’ rights, women’s enhanced knowledge of their rights and increasing \\ntheir bargaining power are reflected on.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Create an enabling environment for women’s advanceme nt: The socio -political environment, legal \\nand policy support, an d congenial social norms are the key in this area. Oversight, enforcement of laws, \\nregular collection of sex -disaggregated data, gender and social analysis skills including the capacity to \\ndevelop, implement, and monitor gender strategies, understanding of  gender issues in the sector are the \\nkey areas.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Enhancing Mother and child benefit programme: This relates to enhancing facilities for mother and \\nchildren though provisions of cash and in -kind transfers. This also includes  establishing and operating \\nsocial clubs and recreation centres  for the development of the participating adolescents and for ending \\nchild marriages. Extensive programmes and projects are also required to be launched for the early \\nchildhood development, protection of the children from vio lence and repression and for overall \\ndevelopment of the children.  \\n \\nTo implement these strategic objectives, following eight action areas have been identified that will \\ncontribute in achieving results in these four areas.  \\n1. Increase access to human developmen t opportunities  \\n2. Enhance access to and control over diversified economic opportunities and resources  \\n3. Increase participation and decision making at all levels  \\n4. Establish conducive legal and regulatory environment for gender equality  \\n5. Provide Infrastructure an d communication services for women  \\n6. Improve institutional capacity, accountability and oversight  \\n7. Increase protection and resilience from crisis and shocks  \\n8. Promote positive social norms  \\n1. Increase access to human development opportunities  \\nBuilding the human ca pital of women to foster equality of opportunity is essential. Early and continuous \\ninvestments in human development for girls are necessary for equitable economic growth. Education, \\nhealth, nutrition, freedom from violence and such others are considered e nabling human development \\nopportunities. To implement this strategic objective, the Seventh Plan will focus on the following areas.  \\nLife cycle -based disease prevention and curative healthcare services:  Considering the current realities of \\nwomen in Banglade sh, a lifecycle -based healthcare system including tertiary care should be accessible to \\nwomen within affordable cost. It should include ante and post -natal, adolescent health, maternal, \\nreproductive, geriatric and tertiary care. The health care system shou ld address the differential needs of \\nwomen and men at all ages at a low cost in all areas including remote geographical areas. Investment on \\ninformation and motivational campaigns for the need and availability of immunization, preventive care and \\nscreening  services for all children, adolescents and women should be enhanced. The primary health care, \\nimmunization, maternal and ante -natal care for pregnant women and post -natal care services should be \\nexpanded in all areas and ensure equal immunization for men and women, boys and girls in the rural and   \\n \\n749 \\n remote areas. Information and motivation campaigns should be enhanced for reproductive healthcare, and \\nprotection from harmful diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya, HIV/AIDS and diseases associated with \\nchildbirth. L aboratory testing for these diseases should be available at a low cost all over the country. \\nWomen and child friendly hospitals should be expanded to all districts and upazilas. Tertiary care for major \\ndiseases including surgery and geriatric care should b e ensured at the district levels. Registration and \\ntracking of services and universal health insurance for the senior citizens should be introduced. HIV testing \\nand counselling  should be scaled up for high risk groups, migrant labourers and their spouses  \\nEqual access to nutrition: The high rate of malnutrition among children and women calls for a \\nmultidimensional approach including Information and awareness on child/women nutrition, the \\nintergenerational health impact, food value, food diversity, low cost n utritional options to address \\nnutritional deficiencies. The on-going  iron acid (IFA) supplementation, postpartum and child vitamin A \\nsupplementation, treating intestinal parasites, distribution of albendazole tablets, and the deworming \\nprogrammes should be  strengthened and expanded. Awareness to control obesity and overweight, the \\nimportance of physical work and healthy food, safe water and sanitation should be undertaken. Universal \\nsalt iodization, compulsory physical exercise in schools and target specifi c food fortification for \\nmicronutrients should be promoted.  Food security and safety net programmes especially those for maternal \\nsupport should address women’s/children’s nutritional deficiencies by distributing fortified food items \\nparticularly in the c alamity/poverty prone areas. Adolescent nutrition should be given additional care. \\nPromotion and expansion of homestead gardening and poultry in the rural and remote areas introducing \\nclimate tolerant varieties is essential in order to ensure protein and v itamin consumption.   \\nModern reproductive health and family planning services : Counselling services on population control, \\nreproductive health and behaviour  and family planning services should continue and expand at community \\nlevels in both rural and urban  areas. Motivation in urban slums and remote areas on modern contraceptives \\nand availability of modern contraceptives at a low cost should be ensured. Teaching of the reproductive \\nhealth education for adolescents in the school curriculum should be ensured.  In the lowest performing \\ndistricts additional support is needed for awareness raising, and education on reproductive health among \\nyoung boys and girls to prepare them as future adults.  \\nQuality formal education:  Universal access to quality education at all  levels with enhanced completion for \\ngirls and boys has to be ensured. Formal education is a precondition for decisions making positions, \\ntherefore gradual transition of all non -formal education to formal education should be planned and acted \\nupon. Quality  education for teachers, curriculum improvement (promote equality and inclusiveness), \\nintroduction of extra -curricular activities to build confidence and to overcome the limitations in learning \\noutcomes should be ensured.  Support for transition from prima ry and completion of secondary education \\nfor both boys and girls should be ensured through poverty focused stipends, free education, books, \\ncampaigns and so on.  Scholarships, special quota provisions, proximity of colleges, infrastructure including \\naccomm odation, transport, water/sanitation for girls and such support for continuation at the college and \\ntertiary levels need to be ensured. Increased proportion of trained women teachers, teachers trained on \\ninclusive education and making the education environ ment safe for girls are essential. The registration and \\nlicensing process for private universities and colleges should have criteria on facilities and quota for girls. \\nLearning language should be emphasized and curriculum and teaching staff should be prepa red.    \\n \\n750 \\n STEM  and ICT education for girls:  Science, technology, engineering  and mathematics (STEM)  education \\nstreams with qualified faculty should be promoted in schools, colleges and universities through regulatory \\nmeasures and increase girls’ participation by establishing targets. Community awareness and motivation \\nshould be strengthened to send girls to STEM  at the school and at the tertiary level and technical education. \\nAdditional stipends and support for girls, science fair, special training for teachers  and science education \\nfacility at upazila levels should be expanded for increasing girl students in STEM . Girls should be \\nintroduced to ICT and encouraged to undertake higher education in ICT.  \\nMarketable technical and vocational education including ICT:  The key requirement to access job market \\nis to have marketable education and skills. The educational curriculum should be reviewed and updated to \\ncater to the needs of the country and the changing global requirements based on labour market analysis and \\nfuture projections. The selection of stream for girls should be backed by career counselling on market needs. \\nThe technical stream should be strengthened to attract more girls. Other areas to focus are standardization \\nand equivalency of technical education an d vocational skills with international market, focusing on \\ndemand -driven skill development system should be prioritized. Measures for proficiency in ICT for all, \\nmodernization of trade skills education like driving; learning international languages; hands on training; \\nglobally acceptable certification system; and improving teachers’ qualification are needed. Domestic and \\ninternational market need assessment and adjustment of curriculum should be undertaken regularly. Support \\nfor girls like hostel, stipend, sanitation facilities, market information, internship in technical fields and \\nincentives should be ensured.   \\nSafe water and sanitation services:   Easy access to safe water for drinking and household use facilitates \\nwomen’s empowerment by reducing time spe nt on searching for safe water and thereby allowing them to \\nbe engaged in productive endeavours.  Access to water and sanitation services is also essential for household \\nhealth care. It can save the family from additional expenses and women from care servi ces. These services, \\nboth at home and in public places would be expanded to facilitate women’s participation in economic and \\npolitical activities.  Arsenic and saline screening would be ensured and traditional filtering methods would \\nbe disseminated widely . Also, water conservation programme for the Northern region and coastal belt is \\nimportant to ease water stress and protect from salinity.  \\nEnding child marriage:  Child marriage is prevalent and is a barrier to girls’ ability to reach their potential, \\nfulfil their aspirations and contribute to their communities. In Bangladesh 33% girls are already mothers by \\nage 19, posing significant risks to their health as well as the increased probability of children becoming \\nstunted. This will require action in multipl e areas.  The existing age at marriage for girls and boys would \\nbe strictly enforced. Compulsory registration after birth of a child will be ensured. The revised Child \\nMarriage Restraint Act 2013 would include penal provisions for both guardians and regist ers. Civil society \\nmovements against child marriage would be strengthened, community orientation improved and support \\nfor continuation of education at secondary levels will be ensured to eliminate child marriage.   \\nParticipation in sports and culture:   Wom en’s participation in sports and cultural activities would be \\nensured from school to build self -confidence  amongst girls. Extra -curricular  activities would be encouraged \\nand supported in educational institutions and outside.  \\n   \\n \\n751 \\n Protection and development of physically and mentally challenged women:  As almost 10% population \\nis physically or mentally challenged, the upcoming disability survey would identify extent and types of \\ndisability disaggregated by sex.   Based on the new National Social Security Strateg y (NSSS), appropriate \\nsocial protection measures would be further extended and expanded to cover more such persons, especially \\nwomen.  The needs of this group would also be addressed within human development and economic \\ndevelopment agenda as well.  \\n2. Enhance  access to and control over productive resources  \\nIncreased access to productive resources enhances women’s self -reliance and income. It is important to \\nenhance women’s capacity to enter the labour market for income.  Three important areas facilitating inco me \\nare, job creation; connecting with productive jobs being created or get help to create own jobs in self -\\nemployment; and increasing women’s productivity of the existing jobs.  \\nCreating short - and long -term opportunities for decent employment:  To increase women’s labour force \\nparticipation, short and long -term employment for women is essential. The private sector should be \\nencouraged and incentivized  to support women’s employment in non -traditional areas.  Monitoring to \\nenforce equal wage and benefits for w omen and men as per Labour laws should be strengthened. Safety net \\nprogrammes designed to create employment for women and men should support transition to sustainable \\nemployment. Target for short -term employment opportunities under construction and develop ment projects \\nfor women should be set for women equal wage.  \\nGenerating employment in public and private sectors at home and abroad:  The public sector should fulfil \\nthe quota of women in staff positions. Filling up of the existing vacant positions can abso rb a large number \\nof women with right qualifications. The quota of 15% for women staff in public service should be enhanced \\nand for outsourced employment, the supplier should be directed to ensure women’s employment. The \\nworking conditions should be improv ed with recruitment, promotions especially at senior levels; addressing \\nsafety and security concerns at field levels; decent work environment, and gender sensitivity among \\nmanagement. Transparent recruitment, promotion and annual evaluation should be ensur ed. The private \\nsector should be regulated to increase women’s employment and the situation of women in the workforce \\nshould be monitored.  \\nUndertaking labour market analysis for expanding opportunities at home and abroad:   Women’s skills \\nfor access and mob ility within the local and international job market through regular labour market  analysis \\nshould be ensured. Updating of information; support for Balancing, Modernization, Rehabilitation and \\nExpansion (BMRE); modernization of trade skills; product diversi fication, upgrading of employable \\neducation and skills should continue based on market need assessment. Labour market needs should be \\ninformed to education sector for updating education system and curriculum.  \\nEnsuring safe migration in an expanded range o f professions:  Market research for exploring the \\npossibilities of external market should be undertaken and new avenues explored. Safe migration should be \\nensured through  skills enhancement, compulsory pre departure training, language skills, skills on self -\\ndefence , proper screening, and registration for women and men. The majority of Bangladeshi women \\nmigrants work as housemaids in the Middle Eastern countries. Aspirant women should be given self - \\ndefence  training and be selected based on screening. Screeni ng on the bases of their capacity to cope, \\nlanguage skills, ability of self -defence , and the skills of the job should be ensured. Attention should be   \\n \\n752 \\n given to their safety and work -related issues , e.g. low paid and exploitative job conditions, sexual abus e, \\nlack of information on migration opportunities and risks; and insufficient services to protect their rights as \\nworkers should be addressed. Legal and shelter support for migrant workers need expansion in countries \\nwhere number of women workers is  high. The returnee migrant workers need compulsory health screening \\nand quarantine services upon return. The overall management of labour migration, protection and decent \\nemployment conditions to the Bangladeshi migrant workers should be ensured. The recruiting agencies \\nshould be made accountable to ensure proper job condition and should be penalized if failed. Women’s \\nemployment in professional category should b e promoted through education, tr aining, linkage, information \\nand support.  \\nCreating opportunities for h igher -value self -employment:  In context of the limited employment \\nopportunities in public and private sectors, self -employment is a critical avenue for women. This is also an \\noption for women who lack marketable skills, education, cannot go out for employm ent due to household \\nresponsibilities. Information about opportunities, markets, skills, finance, time saving and green \\ntechnology, and training can support women to participate in farm and non -farm activities. Support to \\nfacilitate women’s access to high value crop production, higher level of the value chain and services should \\nbe ensured. The private sector, NGOs, business associations and media should also play important role.  \\nPromoting business development services for entrepreneurs:  For economic empowe rment, women need \\nsupport for entrepreneurship development and business. Entrepreneurs should be assisted for business  \\nplanning and marketing. They need skills to provide required papers, business plan, financial management, \\nand marketing at home and abroa d. Chambers of commerce and business associations should support \\nwomen entrepreneurs in developing business plan and linking with the banks and PFIs. SME Foundation, \\nBangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) and JMS should expand one stop  support \\nprovisions for women entrepreneurs at the district levels. Business incubator services should be expanded \\nby the chambers and associations. Comprehensive information with details of financial support from \\ndifferent banks and financial institutions  for women with criteria, procedure, required papers and guarantee, \\nceiling and interest rate etc. should be developed by SME foundation and updated annually for the women \\nentrepreneurs. Marketing support should be provided to women by DWA, JMS , Joyeeta an d others. The \\nJoyeeta model should be expanded in the country. BSCIC Associations and the Export Promotion Bureau \\n(EPB) should facilitate women’s participation in trade fairs at home and abroad and promote ICT and social \\nmedia -based information disseminati on. Women entrepreneurs should be informed of all  changes in \\nindustrial, tax, tariff, financing policies. All relevant policies should ensure growth and expansion of women \\nentrepreneurship. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) should establish criteria and support women \\nentrepreneurs by providing tax -holiday, special incentives, tax -rebate, for newly established enterprises of \\nwomen.  \\nImproving Financial Inclusion:  Women need easy access to savings instruments, productive \\ninvestment and consumption opportunit ies. Inclusive financial system to ensure access of women in \\nsimple terms at a low and no interest should be established. The Investment Component of Vulnerable  \\nGroup Development (ICVGD) model should be expanded for provision of capital and skills for the \\npoor. T he banks and financial institutions should simplify the procedures, delegate authorities at the \\ndivision/district levels up to a certain limit for lending to support women entrepreneurs avail the \\nopportunities provided by Bangladesh Bank for institu tional finance. All transfer of social allowance and \\nfinance should be through G2P using ICT.    \\n \\n753 \\n Improving work environment: Improvement of work environment through safety, occupational health and \\nsafety and maternity, unemployment benefits.  The directives of  the High Court on prevention of workplace \\nviolence should be followed.  Medical, child care and other facilities should be improved to encourage \\nwomen to join and continue in the labour market.  Infrastructure and logistics support should be ensured \\nfor w omen including breast feeding facilities at workplace. In addition, fair wage for informal employment \\nshould be ensured and equality of wage for men and women should be enforced. Provisions of maternity \\nand child care support should be ensured. Elimination  hazardous work and child labour and creating decent \\nwork, occupational health and safety, unemployment benefits  and human development opportunities for \\nworking persons should be ensured . \\nAddressing violence and sexual harassment in public spheres:  Creatin g public opinion against VAW in \\npublic places through community orientation and motivation by using communication methods and media \\nwill be emphasized. The High Court directives on prevention of workplace violence by establishing \\nCommittee and complain box  should be followed by all ministries, agencies, offices and private sector \\ncorporate offices. The Ministry of Public Administration should issue a guideline for all ministries, agencies \\nand private sector to comply with the directives. Legislation to addr ess sexual harassment as per Supreme \\nCourt order will be a priority. Fast action on violence committed at public/work places and orientation on \\nthe laws for the members of law enforcing agencies in implementation and enforcement of the legal \\nprovisions sho uld be ensured.   \\nEnsuring access to local, national and international markets and productive assets:  All the government \\nagencies (livestock, fisheries, agriculture etc.) should take specific measures in reaching women with \\nsupport for training on technolo gy, market information, production techniques, sources of raw materials, \\netc.  Extension services should reach women to open new employment opportunities  for women. The \\ndistribution of seeds, fertilizer, and other inputs through women farmer groups should be arranged. Market \\ninformation and market linkages should be established for women with different chain shops, international \\nbuyers and online platforms. The Export Promotion Bureau and the embassies should explore and help in \\nidentifying new markets for new and diversified products and help exploitation of regional trading \\nopportunities.  \\nPromoting higher value activities in agro and industrial value chains:  Women should be supported to \\nreceive technical and technological knowledge about different levels o f value chain of agricultural and non -\\nagricultural products. Agribusiness development opportunities, access to backward linkages  for industrial \\nproducts should be incorporated in women’s business development programmes and i n one stop service \\nfacilities. Women should be supported with information on markets of different products, scope of \\nparticipation in trade and export fairs. Value chain of different products should be identified, disseminated \\nand supported with technology and inputs for women. Ethnic cr afts of different areas should be supported \\nfor high value generation and diversification.  \\nOwnership of land and productive resources (land, seed, inputs and extension services):  Women’s access \\nto productive resources should be increased. Community orienta tion and legal enactment  on the Prime \\nMinister’s directive to give women due share of their inherited property should be initiated and enforced. \\nThe current practice of distribution of khas land in the name of both spouses of poor families and women’s \\naccess to forestry resources through co -management groups should continue and expand. In case of disaster \\ninduced migration, women should be considered as a special group for housing or land support. The spirit \\nof CEDAW and its application in case of inheritan ce in other countries with Muslim majority should be \\nassessed and considered for a uniform family code.    \\n \\n754 \\n Access to and decision -making over use and protection of community resources:  Women’s participation \\nin accessing and taking decisions regarding communi ty resources should be ensured by provisions of \\nwomen’s participation under the Social Forestry Rules, Water Management Policy, Forestry Sector Policy, \\nWATSAN Policy and such others. All sectors should consider access of women to community resources \\nsuch a s shop distribution in markets, or agriculture in khas lands. Women’s participation in water, forestry \\nor such other associations and groups should be ensured to reach a critical mass and monitored to benefit \\nthem.  Provision of imparting training and prov iding information should be incorporated to prepare women \\nto participate effectively in these groups.  \\nAccess to technology and information on upcoming opportunities in ICT and technology:  Access to \\nmodern technology related to business and jobs should be e xpanded at a low cost. Women’s access to \\ninformation related to markets, employment, or business opportunities should be increased through using \\nmedia and ICT. Information dissemination through mobile phones, internet, radio and social media etc. \\nshould be  increased and women should be trained to access the information. The A2I should reach young \\ngirls and the less educated persons.  Opportunities in outsourcing, ICT and other technological work should \\nbe identified, disseminated and women should be support ed to access them.   \\n3. Increase participation and decision making  \\nParticipation in national politics and local government:  In the last decades, women’s participation in \\nnational Parliament and local government has increased mainly due to the quota provisions . To enhance \\nwomen’s voices on behalf of women rights in the Parliament or LGIs -, apprenticeship , training, campaigns, \\nand support programmes should be extended. Women’s participation to contest in the regular seats should \\nbe increased through capacity bui lding and ensuring implementation of the RPO provisions. Training \\nwomen public representatives and should be expanded. Monitoring to strengthen women’s role in different \\ncommittees is also important.  Community should be oriented to support women’s politic al participation \\nand women in reserved seats should be oriented to play their effective role, taking leadership and gradually \\ncompete in the regular seats.  \\nRPO provisions and targets, and benchmarks and responsibilities:  The provisions of RPO 2013 related  to \\nwomen’s participation and representation in political parties should be ensured by enforcing it within the \\nregistration criteria. Provision for direct election of women Parliamentarians in reserved seat will give them \\nopportunity to contribute to a com munity and be accountable to their constituency. Change in the constitutional \\nprovision for assigning them specific constituency and direct election has been a demand for long time from \\ncivil society. The extension of the provision of 50 female Parliamenta rians in the reserved seats for 25 years \\nshould be combined with provision of direct election through an amendment of the Constitution.  \\nConfidence, knowledge, capability and opportunity to participate in public sphere:  Training, orientation \\nand knowledge  enhancement opportunities should be provided to all women employed in the public sector. \\nThe capacity of the existing training institutions should be enhanced with faculty experienced and trained \\non gender. Women government employee s should be trained to b e gender responsive, confident in \\nleadership and decision making. Women’s confidence should be enhanced through orientation, support and \\nparticipation in extra curriculum activities.  \\n   \\n \\n755 \\n Representation/ leadership of women in public institutions, business and  trade:  Women’s representation \\nshould be ensured in public institutions through instructions and directives. Training and capacity building \\nsupport should be institutionalized in public institutions for women. Private sector institutions and trade \\nbodies s hould be instructed to develop their own gender strategies and ensure women’s representation at \\ndifferent levels. Women’s role in decision making forums of private sector should  be included as criteria \\nto qualify for different incentives. The private secto r should be encouraged to bring women on the Boards. \\nWomen’s participation in delegations and committees for trade and other important negotiations should be \\nmade mandatory though policy provisions. Rules and regulations on different sectors and businesses  should \\nbe easily accessible by women.  \\nTargets for women’s representation at all levels:  Representation of women in different services and \\norganizations should be enhanced by taking specific measures. It is important to include women in national \\nand intern ational representation and in areas previously considered as men’s domain. Women’s presence \\nin various sectors should be assessed and the sectors with women’s low presence should be guided to \\ninclude more women. This can only be done when the capability of  women in different groups is enhanced \\nand no discriminatory practices are in place.   \\n Local government citizens’ committees for stronger voices and role of women:  The ward committees at \\nthe union level, the Town and Ward level Coordination Committees und er the municipalities, the Upazila \\nWomen’s Forum and the Standing Committees under the unions should be strengthened ensuring women’s \\nleadership and participation as per the laws. The open budget formulation, development planning and \\nproject implementation  with participation of women and addressing their needs should be enforced and \\nmonitored. Proper communication to bring in women in these forums, support for their capacity building \\nand utilization of the gender budget for local government institutions sho uld be ensured as per the guidelines \\nand monitored.  \\nInformed and independent decision -making over reproductive health:  Information and education should  \\nbe available to enhance women’s control over their own reproductive health. The education for employmen t \\nand economic gain for women’s self -reliance and confidence should include information on elements of \\nreproductive health care, and availability of such care.  Counselling services should be made available in \\nall health care centres  for men, women and cou ples.  Reproductive health care should also be available to \\nthe single women whose needs go unrecognized.  \\nMembership and leadership in associations and decision -making forums:  Memberships in different \\nsectoral  committees and associations including business  associations should enforce measures to include \\nmore women. The water management associations, sanitation committees, water supply committees, \\ndisaster management committee, forest management committees and such others formed as per the \\npolicies/rules of the sectoral ministries should include women with clear TORs. Women should be oriented \\non their roles and responsibilities and their male counterparts should be oriented on equal participation and \\nroles in decision making.  \\nYouth forums and clubs for leader ship development:  Youth forums and the adolescent clubs formed under \\ndifferent ministries including M oWCA should be expanded and strengthened. They should  include \\nprovision of leadership orientation for young women, on development context, and roles of the  youth in \\nattaining targets of the SDGs. The role of youth in reducing harmful practices, enhancing growth, and \\nhuman development should be prioritized.    \\n \\n756 \\n 4. Establish Conducive Legal and Regulatory Environment  \\nRemove all discriminatory provisions in laws and policies in consistency with CEDAW:  Despite \\nformulation of good laws, some laws and policies are not yet in full conformity with CEDAW. These need \\nreview and revision to make the laws/policies uniform and equal for all. The law of inheritance and personal \\nlaws should be reviewed to make them consistent with CEDAW. All sectoral policies should be reviewed \\nfrom gender lens to make them more conducive to women’s participation and empowerment. M oWCA’s \\ncapacity should be strengthened to provide technical support  to line ministries in reviewing and revising \\nsuch laws and policies. Partnership with women groups can be helpful. Reservations on CEDAW, \\nparticularly on Article 2 should be withdrawn as per the recommendation of the Law Commission.  \\nEnforcement of all law s to uphold rights of women and girls:  Though the legal and policy provisions \\ninclude many positive aspects, the hindrances  to their enforcement should be removed through establishing \\neffective mechanisms, accountability and training for law enforcing agen cies. All laws related to the rights \\nof disadvantaged groups like the persons with disabilities (PWDs)’ Rights and the Protection Act 2013 \\nshould be implemented with care for assisting female PWD’s development in all areas. The constitutional \\nprovisions to  protect ethnic minority groups and women should be enforced strictly. The Legal Aid Fund \\nshould be increased and the legal system should be simplified and faster in case of rape and sexual \\nharassment. Practice of gender sensitive procedures, retention of legal practitioners to support women, more \\ntribunals to deal with repression of women and girls and human trafficking, security of justice seekers \\nshould be ensured.  \\nEnactment of laws and formulate policies on the High Court directives on sexual harassment : Law needs \\nto be formulated as per the directives from the High Court in 2010 on sexual harassment in public places \\nlike educational  institutions and work place. The High Court’s directive of 2019 on monitoring the \\ncompliance should be followed. Education al institutions and all private sector agencies should be directed \\nto follow the procedure to address sexual harassment as per the High Court’s order. Compliance by public \\nand private sector should be monitored.   \\nNational laws in consistency with ILO conv ention on sexual harassment:  The Violence and Harassment \\nConvention, 2019 (No. 190) and Recommendation (No. 206) has been recently adopted due to the recent \\nglobal outcry against violence and harassment. The Convention aims to shape work environment  based on \\ndignity and respect, and free from violence and harassment. Work -related communications, including those \\nenabled by ICT, domestic violence, gender -based violence and harassment including the account of third \\nparties (e.g. clients, customers, service pro viders and patients) are included. The domestic laws and policies \\non labour, migration, occupational health and safety and other relevant laws of Bangladesh should be \\nreviewed and made consistent with the Convention.   \\nRecognize and uphold the rights of th e girl child in laws and policies:  Girl children as a distinct group \\nshould be recognized as girls are also vulnerable to violence and exploitation. Their rights and advancement \\nshould  be upheld in all relevant policies and laws.  All new laws and policies  should be reviewed by \\nMoWCA before their approval and enactment to ensure this. Partnership with child rights groups should be \\npromoted for the purpose.    \\n \\n757 \\n Women’s rights in sectoral laws and policies:  Some new laws and policies formulated in different sect ors \\naddress gender  aspects and the others do not. All sectoral laws and policies should ensure addressing \\ngender -based needs in the sector. They should increase women’s/girls’ participation and benefit within the \\nlegal and policy provisions. All laws and p olicies should be reviewed before their approval and enactment \\nby M oWCA and gender experts.  \\nAccountability of law enforcers:  The incumbent government is firmly committed to eliminate all sorts of \\nviolence  against women. To achieve this objective,  the law e nforcing agencies are to be more effective and \\nactivated. The instantaneous response of the law enforcers can save the most vulnerable women and \\nchildren. The present 999 apps in really a good initiative to receive the most urgent cry for help but it \\ndepen ds upon the sincerity of them. The law enforcers might be given training and motivation and their \\naccountability might be ensured.  \\nProper motivation and upbringing of the adolescent boys and girls:  The government  want s to make the \\nadolescent boys and girls  aware on multifarious issues like demerits of child marriage, violence against \\nwomen and girls, discrimination against the women by organizing clubs all over the country. Initiatives \\nwill also be taken t o facilitate them for different sports and different  cultural activities.   \\nRegulatory measures in public and private institutions:  Government should direct all public and private \\ninstitutions to ensure women’s participation and benefits through incorporating provisions in human \\nresource policies (recruitme nt, training, promotion) and removing all provisions that hinder women’s \\nadvancement . Each agency should be motivated to have specific target or measures for women’s \\ndevelopment. A mandatory reporting from large institutions above a minimum turn over shoul d be brought \\nunder reporting on progress.  \\n5. Provide Infrastructure and Communication Services for Women  \\nClimate resilient infrastructure:  In the natural calamity prone areas, all infrastructure (transport, energy, \\nwater, sanitation, market, service centres ) design and construction should consider the climate change \\naffects  and be resilient to climatic shocks. In order to facilitate continued mobility, services and livelihood \\nof the people, men and women the infrastructures should address gender -based needs. H ygienic water and \\nsanitation services, communication infrastructure for early warning about calamities, all weather \\ntransportation should be established and maintained. Shelters should include water, sanitation, privacy, to \\naddress women’s needs and suppor t child care, disability, child birth and address women’s safety and \\nsecurity concerns.  \\nInfrastructure design considering women’s needs and priorities:  All infrastructure including building, \\ntransport (bus, train and water ways) should be convenient for w omen, children and PWDs. Public  building \\ncode should include provision of separate water, sanitation, breast feeding facilities (as per High Court \\ndirectives in 2019) for  office, station, bus terminal, water ways terminal, clubs, movie house, shopping \\nmall, stadium, local government institutions, courthouse, museum, theatre, tourist spots, university and such \\nother places. Approval of building design by relevant authorities should ensure all the facilities. Existing \\nbuildings should gradually include the fa cilities.    \\n \\n758 \\n Gender responsive transportation (land, water, air) services and infrastructure:  Infrastructure and \\ntransport services are key s to increase women’s participation in public spheres. Safe and affordable \\ntransport system should be ensured to increa se women’s and children’s mobility. The frequency of \\naffordable public transport should be increased with reserved seats for women, elderly and the pregnant \\nwomen. Women only buses during peak period should be increased. Transport providers should be \\nmotiv ated and legal provisions should be established and enforced for this. Factories/employers employing \\nmore women should be guided to operate transport services for staff/workers and they can be provided loan \\nfacilities to operate transport services for staf f. A policy to increase bus services at least for girls\\' schools \\nand colleges in all cities of the country is important.  Safety and security (lighting, police patrols, safe \\ntoilets, waiting rooms) measures in public transport stations should be compulsory  for transport \\nmanagement. Cleaning of foot paths, compulsory use of over bridges for road crossing, increased public \\ntransports are some measures to support women’s mobility. Road safety should be ensured through \\nenforcement of traffic rules and laws. Tra ining/orientation on the importance of traffic safety should be \\nprovided to both public and private service providers using media and also in schools. The upcoming metro \\nrail and the mass rapid transit system should include safe ticketing, waiting, commuti ng, toilet and breast -\\nfeeding facilities at the stations. Railway and water ways stations should also ensure safety and security \\nmeasures with water, sanitation, waiting and breast -feeding facilities and ensure safety and mobility for \\nwomen. Commuter train  services between Dhaka and nearby cities, like Narayanganj, Gazipur, and Tongi  \\nshould be introduced/  increased with ladies’ compartments at peak hours. Trains should gradually introduce \\nlow locomotives to facilitate mobility of women, children and elderly . \\nGeographical equity in access to infrastructure:  Infrastructure development should be aim at connectivity \\nwith remote areas. The backward and remote areas should be given priority in order to attain infrastructural \\nequity. All persons of all class, ethni city, religion, physical ability and geographic location should have \\naccess to basic infrastructure for mobility, education, health, energy and services. Road infrastructure, \\nrailway and water transportation, water supply, sanitation should be improved in the lagging rural and \\nsuburban areas. Smooth transportation, ICT communication and access to services should be ensured in the \\nhilly and remote riverine regions. Access to water and sanitation for the hill districts, coastal salinity and \\ncyclone prone area s, and some of the northern districts having low access should be prioritized for services.  \\nAccess to supportive infrastructures (e.g. safe, secured workplace and housing): Infrastructure for \\nworkplace safety and security concerns, child care, housing and  toilet facilities, etc. should be ensured by \\nthe private sector as well. Motivation and regulatory provisions for private sectors should be established to \\ndevelop low cost housing, child care facilities and transportation services with water and sanitatio n facilities \\nfor employees. High court directives on breast feeding facilities in public places should be strictly \\nmonitored. Dispersal of industries to improve the living conditions of workers of with adequate \\ninfrastructure is essential. Women’s access t o rural market corners and such infrastructure should be \\nexpanded in collaboration with the local government institutions (e.g. municipalities, city corporations) in \\nboth urban and rural areas.  \\nAccess to energy services:  Women’s access to energy (power, fu el and green) should be increased for \\nreducing their drudgery and saving time for productive employment and increase their access to \\ninformation. Women’s expanded access to renewable energy should be ensured in both grid and off -grid \\nareas to facilitate th eir economic participation. The energy policy should enhance women’s access to solar \\npower, bio -gas, improve cook -stoves etc.     \\n \\n759 \\n 6. Improve Institutional Capacity, Accountability and Oversight  \\nEffective /strong institutional mechanism at parliament, ministry a nd LGI levels:  The existing \\ninstitutional mechanism  for women’s advancement needs to be more effective with accountability, capacity \\nand authority. Regular guidance from NCWCD, functioning of the committees and the Gender Focal Point \\nmechanism should be en sured.  Other institutions should also be assigned specific roles in promoting gender \\nequality to achieve SDG targets. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) should regularly provide sex \\ndisaggregated data synchronized with the national, sectoral and SDG in dicators and the reporting needs for \\nCEDAW, SDG, ICPD, CRC and such others. IMED should be responsible to monitor gender equality \\nresults of projects/programmes including for programmes under revenue budget. The Office of the Auditor \\nGeneral (OAG) should b e given responsibility of auditing gender budget expenditure to assess the outcome. \\nSimilarly, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) can be assigned for necessary gender \\nresearch and BMET strengthened for analysis of labour markets. Other stat istics generating organizations \\nlike Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), National Institute of \\nPreventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM) should also be strengthened to provide gender analysis of data \\ngenerated. The Annual P erformance Agreements should integrate actions that are consistent with the \\nNational Action Plans and SDG targets.  \\nStrong key institutions: BBS, IMED, Planning commission, MOWCA, MoF:  Capacity of the key \\ninstitutions like the agencies under M oWCA including  DWA and PLAU, IMED, BBS, OAG and Planning  \\nCommission should be strengthened in performing their roles as per mandate in design, review, \\nimplementation, and monitoring of gender equality and women’s advancement related actions and results. \\nMoWCA’s capacity  should be strengthened for a robust oversight role and to uphold its position to monitor \\ngender equality with allocation of adequate resources. BBS has to be assigned to ensure regular collection, \\ncollation and analysis of sex disaggregated data on differ ent sectors as per agreed gender and SDG \\nindicators. Based on requirement, these institutions should be given additional staff, resources and capacity \\nbuilding support for their staff to be able to perform their responsibilities. Capacity of LGIs and \\nimple menting agencies should be strengthened for gender mainstreaming.  \\nFinancial and human resources for GE:  Allocation for financial and human resources to implement the \\nseveral action plans and their targets is to be ensured. Additional resources for implemen ting and \\nmonitoring activities should be allocated. Gender capacity building should also be prioritized. Resources \\nshould be allocated for enhancing capacity of the staff in undertaking management and reporting functions. \\nThe National Action Plans and Annu al Performance Agreements should be used as reference points while \\nallocating resources for women’s empowerment and gender mainstreaming.  \\nGender responsive budgeting for GE results:  The GRB report currently covers 43 ministries and divisions \\nfocusing on al location. Analysis and assessment of gender budget for result has to be institutionalized with \\na comprehensive  assessment of utilization. In addition, the allocation in LGIs for Women Development \\nForum for promoting gender equality should also be monitored  for results. The guidelines for utilization of \\nlocal government fund should be reviewed, particularly to ensure specific allocation and their proper \\nutilization for women and girls. It is necessary to ensure availability of sufficient technical support an d \\ntraining for effective implementation of GRB. Monitoring and review of the completed projects from \\ngender perspectives should be introduced. Capacity of gender focal points on gender budget analysis should \\nbe ensured. Introduction of gender auditing of b ig projects will also strengthen the GRB initiative.    \\n \\n760 \\n Capacity to develop, implement, and monitor gender strategies across government:  Technical competence \\nof the officials  in carrying out gender analysis, assessment, planning, implementation and monitorin g is \\nessential. Orientation of the policy makers, training and capacity building of staff in different institutions \\nshould continue and expand. All training programmes of different institutions should integrate gender issues \\nrelevant to the sectors’ or dep artments’ operation and monitoring of the same. The capacity of Policy \\nLeadership and Advocacy Unit (PLAU) and DWA should be enriched to ensure that the staff are able to \\nmonitor performance and can guide other agencies and ministries, if needed. Gender an alysis should be \\npart of all foundation training courses. Private sectors should be encouraged to incorporate gender \\nperspectives in their operation and employ gender specialists, if needed. The education institutions should \\nbe encouraged to initiate addit ional courses to develop technical knowledge on how to address gender in \\ndifferent sectoral operations.  \\nTransparent and effective monitoring mechanisms to track gender impact:  The review of the 8th FYP and \\nthe SDGs should effectively incorporate monitoring  of gender equality results. The IMED monitoring \\nsystem should integrate monitoring of progress of women’s empowerment and gender based  on project/ \\nprogramme targets. Rigorous monitoring of GRB should be institutionalized with capacity enhancement \\nacross a gencies, sectors and field level. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) should monitor \\nexpenditure and results in gender through the audit. Transparent procedures at different levels should \\ninclude open meetings, publicly available financial disclosure, and budget review.  \\nNational GE related SDG indicators into monitoring systems:  At the national level all progress indicators \\nof the government’s performance should integrate gender indicators besides measuring growth, investment, \\ndeficit etc. Most of the S DG indicators should provide gender perspectives and the identified gender \\nindicators for the 8FYP  should be rigorously used. A compilation of defined gender results indicators in \\nconsistency with the SDGs and sectoral performance should be integrated in t he plan document for all \\nsectors. The poverty assessment and income data should be sex disaggregated in all wealth groups so that \\nwomen’s poverty reduction can be effectively measured.   The APA should also integrate actions to achieve \\nresults as per these  indicators.  \\nResponsibility of persons to be accountable for GE results:  A system of accountability for the achievement \\nof gender equality targets and results must be established. The Project/programme management should \\nensure utilization of resources for gender as per the project documents and be accountable for any failure. \\nPerformance assessment criteria of projects/programmes should ensure assessment of gender targets and \\nresults. The Annual Performance criteria of staff/officials should include measuri ng criteria on their \\nintegrity to promote gender quality and reducing VAW and discrimination.   \\nInclusive and gender -sensitive citizen accountability mechanisms:  Partnership, inclusion and mutual \\naccountability is important to promote gender equality. Incl usiveness is as much about increasing citizen \\ninvolvement in processes as it is about involvement in formal institutions. The Government, private sector, \\nparliaments, local development actors, civil society including women’s organizations, private sector a nd \\nnational women’s machineries should make transparent and binding commitments to work for GE in their \\nown area. The Government should ensure oversight and establish  partnership for ensuring accountability. \\nMechanism to ensure voice of civil society and w omen groups in monitoring progress of women/girls’ \\nparticipation and empowerment should be strengthened.    \\n \\n761 \\n 7. Increased Protection and Resilience from Crisis and Shocks  \\nSocial protection addressing gender inequalities and gender dimensions of poverty and shock s:  The \\nNSSS is designed to addressing the specific concerns and vulnerabilities of women at different stages of \\nthe life cycle. So, its sound implementation will be an essential complement to addressing gender -specific \\nlife cycle risks. The introduction o f the proposed social insurance is particularly important mitigation \\nmeasure for risks faced working women.  \\nProtection from effects of environmental and bio -diversity degradation:  Awareness raising, capacity \\nbuilding and livelihood support activities in en vironmental protection and bio -diversity conservation should \\nbe undertaken and expanded involving women. Children and youth should also be engaged in these \\nactivities to protect environment.  Pollution control, improvement of hygienic practice, economic us e of \\nnatural resources would facilitate protection of environment and depletion of resources. Women and men \\nshould be oriented on forest conservation, renewable energy, land use planning, environmental protection \\nto minimize exposure to hazards.  \\nClimate c hange adaptation, mitigation, resilience, coping, food security, and livelihood:  Adaptation \\ncapacity against climate change impacts should be enhanced amongst community including women. \\nInvestment in disaster preparedness, adaptation capacity building, and climate  resilient livelihood for \\nwomen and men should be enhanced. Women and girl’s capacity should be strengthened to act as whistle \\nblowers before calamities, protect assets, diversify livelihood for more resilient and empowering \\noccupations disaster wa rning, relief and rehabilitation activities. Full implementation of the Climate Change \\nGender Action Plan should be ensured. Provision of adaptive and diversified livelihood services (e.g. low \\ngestation and less water intensive crops, food storage and pres ervation technology, nutrition, and food \\npreservation during calamities) should be expanded to ensure food security amongst vulnerable groups, \\nincluding climate induced migrants of urban areas. Providing women with greater access to employment \\nguarantee sc hemes, public work programmes, skills development, technology, entrepreneurship support \\nand training should also be extended. Women’s capacity and engagement in climate change mitigation like \\ntechnology with low carbon emission, forest and bio -diversity co nservation, water management, renewable \\nenergy, and scientific waste management, should be enhanced.  \\nInformation services to strengthen resilience to climate change, calamities and shocks:  Information \\nservices before, during and after calamities should be ensured for preparation and safety measures during \\nand after calamities (fire, earthquake, disease). First hand contact including police and fire brigade point \\nand available support should be included in all awareness raising programmes. In the natural cal amity prone \\nareas continued mobility and services of the people should be supported by providing information ensuring \\nclimate resilient information services. Provision of services, shelters, livelihood support etc. should be \\ndisseminated to women and men t hrough community radio, campaign and strengthening community \\nnetworks.  \\nMitigation measures during involuntary resettlement:  During construction of large infrastructure projects, \\ninvoluntary resettlements  take place. Women are displaced, their livelihoods a re disrupted and their assets \\nare lost. Therefore, women’s loss should be estimated and they should be given due compensation for the \\nloss of livelihoods and assets for involuntary resettlement during land acquisition and construction of \\ninfrastructure thr ough resettlement plans.    \\n \\n762 \\n National insurance and universal pension coverage for low income vulnerable women: Access to low \\ncost health and maternity care insurance, provision of pension, unemployment insurance, under the social \\ninsurance programmes should b e explored for women. A national social insurance system (NSIS) enabling \\npeople to invest in their own social security, providing protection against the risks of old age, disability , \\nunemployment and maternity will be initiated on a pilot basis under the N ational Social Security Strategy. \\nA low -cost contributory insurance model should be initiated in collaboration with private sector by \\nproviding subsidy, if necessary, so that women can access the support at a low contribution.  \\n8. Influencing Social Norms and  Changing How  Women and Girls are Valued  \\nPortrayal of positive image of girls / women as equal human beings in all media:  Portrayal of women’s \\npositive image will be promoted. The news/feature contents would advocate against VAW, dowry, child \\nmarriage and such evils. Negative projection of women as well as portrayal as commodity would be \\nprevented, and positive portrayal promoted through mass awareness among the media personnel, including \\nfor the media owners. Regulatory measures will also be enforced for p ositive portrayal in promotional for \\nconsumer products and establishing ethical values.   \\nProgramme for men to change norms about men and women’s roles:  More programmes would include \\nactive engagement of men in all spheres to promote women’s advancement a nd curb men’s participation or \\nsupport of harmful practices. Men would be informed and involved in promoting gender equality as they \\noften control or influence social behaviour , women’s mobility outside home and access to reproductive \\nhealth care. It is al so important to develop groups of men as advocate to change social behaviour , prevent \\nVAW, share household responsibility, promote gender equality and hold other men accountable for \\ndiscriminatory behaviour.   \\nWorking with children and adolescents to devel op norms of more egalitarian relationships: Because \\ngender socialization of both boys and girls begins early at home and community, it is important to initiate \\nchange processes at a young age to shape attitudes and transform behaviours . Early initiation an d continued \\ninvestment in children and adolescents is critical through education curriculum, sports and culture, social \\nbehaviour, media and all other means to promote the culture of equality between girls and boys and their \\nequal human rights is necessary , so that men do not grow up with a discriminatory view towards women. \\nA young population of age group 15 to 24 years comprises nearly nine per cent  of the country’s population, \\nwho can be useful strength. Girl -centred programmes equipping adolescent girls  with knowledge and skills \\ncan build their confidence and contribute to the efforts to end inter -generational poverty, illiteracy, ill \\nhealth, and gender inequality.   \\nFreedom from gender -based violence and harassment: The most prevalent human rights abuse  of women \\nis gender -based violence, which not only undermines her dignity but curtails her self -esteem and scope for \\ndevelopment. This impact on women’s lives, society and the economy. Multipronged actions are essential \\nto combat VAW including enforcement of the legal provisions, motivation of family, enhancing community \\nsupport, orientation of youth group, improving women’s human capabilities, access to low cost prosecution \\nservices and economic self -reliance of women. The on-going  initiatives under the mu lti-sectoral programme \\nand institutional mechanisms should be expanded. Prevention should be emphasized and women’s and \\ncommunity awareness of the economic, social and health impact of VAW should be enhanced. Information \\nand support services for women in a ccessing legal support, shelter, counselling should be expanded and   \\n \\n763 \\n support for women’s economic self -reliance should continue. The new dimensions of VAW against the \\nelderly women, children and through ICT need addressing though legal and programmatic prov isions. \\nProtection from IT based crime and cyber safety awareness should be developed all over the country. \\nGeneral guidelines should be issued for all private and public institutions to formulate and enforce policies \\nto protect women from sexual abuse at work places/ educational institutions and other public places.  \\nMarital rape should be brought within legal provisions.  Accountability mechanism has to be strengthened \\nfor the members of law enforcing agencies in addressing VAW. Development and institutio nalizing a \\nprofessional social work mechanism should be explored for support in cases of VAW. Social research \\nshould be conducted to identify the root causes of violence against women and girls and actions to be taken \\nfor remedies.  \\n14.5.4  Implementation o f Eighth Plan Gender Strategy  \\nThe gender agenda for the Eighth Plan is large and priorities for the next five years will have to be set.  \\nPriority areas would be chosen on the basis of contribution towards both economic growth and women’s \\nempowerment and actions that can facilitate results in more than one area. The key areas would be to ensure \\nequal benefit from quality formal education; marketable skills to maximize productivity and potential of \\nwomen; narrowing of wage gap between similarly qualified ma le and female workers; elimination of all \\ntypes of biases against female staff at the work place;  nutrition and lifelong health care; infrastructure that \\nfacilitates women’s human development, mobility and economic gains; and actions that enhances positiv e \\nsocial norms and reduces VAW and other harmful practices. An assessment of geographic areas that lag \\nbehind national average as measured by different gender equality indicators would be prioritized for \\nresource allocation and closing the gender gap in th e identified areas. Enforcement of laws and policies and \\neffective monitoring should be ensured for good administration and governance. The available resource \\nenvelop for 8FYP would be reviewed, resource requirements to address gender equality objectives a nd \\ntargets should be estimated and additional resources should be sought, as needed.   \\nMainstreaming of gender would continue and all macro -economic and sectoral policies would integrate \\ngender as a crosscutting theme. Action plans should be drawn with a v iew to reduce inequality and promote \\nan equal relationship between sexes. To ensure results from actions related to gender equality all reporting \\nof national progress including those related to SDG agenda would be based on sex disaggregated data to \\nallow a  better understanding the progress in the area of gender equality and women’s empowerment. \\nPartnership and cooperation with Civil Society Organizations (CSO) including development and advocacy \\ngroups and private sector would be strengthened to promote thei r role and support in implementation and \\nmonitoring of actions and to achieve good results. Development and advocacy initiatives on gender equality \\nissues and to form public opinion against harmful practices would be pursued jointly and they should be \\npartners in better delivery of services, especially in rural and remote areas.  \\nMore specifically, the gender implementation arrangements will be strengthened through the following \\nactions:  \\nEffective and strong institutional mechanism:  The existing institution al mechanism for women’s \\nadvancement will be made more effective with accountability, capacity and authority. Regular guidance \\nfrom NCWCD, functioning of the committees and the WID Focal Point mechanism would be ensured.  \\nCapacity of the key institutions l ike MOWCA including DWA and PLAU, IMED, BBS, OAG and Planning   \\n \\n764 \\n Commission would be strengthened in performing their roles as per mandate in design, review, \\nimplementation, and monitoring of gender equality and women’s advancement related actions and their \\nresults. M oWCA would be geared more towards an oversight role like other regulatory ministries with \\nreview of its mandate to promote its roles to monitor gender equality with allocation of adequate resources. \\nThe BBS will be tasked with generating gender di saggregated data synchronized with the national and \\nsectoral indicators and the reporting needs for CEDAW, SDG and such others. IMED would have \\naccountability to monitor gender equality results and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) should be \\ngiven re sponsibility of auditing gender budget expenditure.   \\nSufficient financial and human resources for gender mainstreaming:   Generally, there is a lack of \\nresources for agencies in implementing and monitoring activities for advancing women’s rights and gender  \\nequality.  Similarly, there is a general lack of capacity and allocation of human resources to work in this \\narea. Projects/programmes generally lack resources for the identified gender related actions. Often \\nfunctions in this area are consultant dependent . It is therefore important to allocate both financial resources \\nas per targets of each agency and projects and human resources in the institution with capacity development \\nsupport. The National Action Plan would be used as a reference point while allocati ng resources for \\nwomen’s empowerment and gender equality.  \\nAdequate technical knowledge and support services: It is important to increase the number of technically \\ncompetent persons who can carry out gender analysis, assessment, planning, implementation and  \\nmonitoring. Though Dhaka University and some institutions have initiated courses, the education \\ninstitutions should be encouraged to initiate additional courses to develop technical knowledge on how to \\naddress gender in different sectoral operations.  The  capacity of PLAU and DWA should be enriched so \\nthat their staff are able to monitor performance and can guide other agencies and ministries, if needed. \\nGender analysis training should be part of all staff training.  \\nTransparent monitoring mechanisms estab lished and implemented to measure impact of public policies \\nand programmes:  The review of 8FYP programmes should incorporate monitoring of gender equality \\nresults. IMED monitoring should integrate monitoring of progress of women’s empowerment and gender \\nequality based on project/ programme targets. More rigorous monitoring of the gender budget is essential \\nacross agencies, sectors and field level.  The OAG should be assigned to monitor expenditure and results \\nin the area of gender equality. Transparent proc edures at different levels would include holding open \\nmeetings, issuing publicly available financial disclosure statements, and conducting budget review.  \\nCapacity to develop, implement, and monitor gender strategies across government and sectors: Building \\nthe capacity of women and men in institutions to understand gender issues and developing their motivation \\nto bring about changes within their own domain and act accordingly. Orientation of the policy makers and \\ntraining and capacity building of existing st aff contingent in different institutions has to be continued and \\nexpanded. All training programmes of different institutions should integrate gender issues that are relevant \\nto the sectors’ or departments’ operation with specific actions identified and mon itoring of the same. Private \\nsectors should be encouraged to incorporate gender perspectives in their operation and employ gender \\nspecialists, if needed.  \\n   \\n \\n765 \\n Defined national and sectoral gender equality results:  The indicator of the government’s performance on \\ngender will be defined besides measuring growth, investment, deficit etc. A compilation of defined gender \\nequality results with indicators would be integrated in the plan document for all sectors for monitoring \\npurpose. At the national level, a list of gender equality indicators would be identified, agreed and monitored.  \\nThe poverty assessment and income data would be gender disaggregated in all wealth groups so that \\nwomen’s poverty reduction is effectively measured.  \\nAccountability for gender equality results:  Accountability for the achievement of gender equality targets \\nand results must be ensured. The Project/programme management should ensure utilization of resources for \\ngender equality as stated in the project documents, and be accountable for any f ailure. Reallocation of \\nresources from gender equality objectives to other action areas should be restricted. Performance \\nassessment criteria of projects/programmes should ensure assessment of gender equality targets and results. \\nAt country level accountab ility means that the Government, private sector, parliaments, local development \\nactors, civil society including women’s organizations, private sector and national women’s machineries \\nmake transparent and binding commitments and that they all should work fo r gender equality in their own \\narea and be accountable. The Government would provide guidelines, ensure oversight and establish \\npartnership for ensuring accountability.  \\nMonitoring and evaluation:  For establishing good monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mecha nism, it is \\ncritical to have a list of agreed gender equality indicators at the national level for measuring the progress of \\ngender equality. These may include employment in formal sector, tertiary education, reduction of VAW \\nand child marriage, reduction of maternal mortality and malnutrition, reduction of poverty of female headed \\nhouseholds and such other key areas. These should be consistent with the indicators of the NAP and the SD \\ngoals.  At the sectoral level, a few key performance indicators (KPI) in  each sector would be identified and \\nmonitored. The GED of the Planning Commission would finalize the indicators with support from sectoral \\nministries. All relevant stakeholders working in the sector should be informed of the expected results and \\nindicator s so that they are also active in implementing actions and monitoring for those results.  \\n14.6 SOCIAL INCLUSION  \\nIn addition to women, vulnerable populations in Bangladesh encompasses different social groups such as \\nchildren, elderly, ethnic and religious minor ities, people with disabilities or physical impairments and low \\ncaste groups. All these heterogeneous groups are generally vulnerable to extreme poverty, natural disasters, \\nand other external shocks that may impact their well -being. Likewise, their access to health and nutrition \\nservices is often restricted and their education participation and achievement tends to be low. Thus, the \\ndifferent needs and priorities of these social groups must be taken into account when planning to eradicate \\npoverty and improv e Human Resource Development. Empowerment through increased participation in the \\nvarious spheres of a society is the most efficient and inclusive way to do so. This positively reinforces the \\ndevelopment of a nation and strengthens economic growth both dire ctly and indirectly, in addition to \\nincreasing social stability and the well -being of its citizens.  \\n   \\n \\n766 \\n 14.6.1  Seventh Plan Progress with Inclusion  \\nThrough the Constitution, the Government is committed to eliminating all kind of social exclusion. This is \\na long-term agenda and continuous efforts are needed. For the Seventh Plan, goals and strategic approaches \\nwere identified for each of these groups, exploring the most efficient ways to include and empower them \\nwithin the society. The progress in addressing t he exclusion challenges in each group is reviewed below.  \\nChildren:  Major progress has been made in promoting children’s status, their survival and welfare. For \\ninstance, Bangladesh has made good progress in child focused SDGs focusing on primary and seco ndary \\neducation as well as child mortality. Nonetheless, poverty among households with in 2016 was around 30 \\nper cent, significantly higher than the national poverty rate of 24.3 per cent. In addition, children are more \\nsusceptible to abuse, exploitation a nd natural disaster. Many additional issues linger in terms of \\nmalnutrition, poverty, and low or lack of education.  \\nSeventh Plan strategy:  The Seventh Plan strategy for inclusion is based on implementation of the \\nConstitution that provides equal rights an d opportunities to all citizens irrespective of race, religion, caste, \\ncreed or profession. The Seventh Plan’s focuses mainly on their welfare as well as their legal protection \\nand their rights. Improved health was expected to be achieved through 1) contro lling communicable and \\nnon-communicable diseases as well as increasing behavioral change communications in schools about \\nhealth and healthy practices; 2) increasing food and nutrition intakes of children; and 3) ensuring access to \\nsafe water and sanitation  to reduce environmental health hazards for children. The children’s access to good \\nquality education was expected to be strengthened through early childhood development strategies and \\naccess to formal and non -formal education. Legal protection of Children  was expected to be achieved by \\n1) creating a national platform for allowing children to express opinions on their needs; 2) enforcing and \\nharmonizing laws against children abuse, trafficking, exploitation; 3) mobilizing municipal corporations to \\nregister all births; 4) eliminating child labour by instigating the National Plan of Action for Implementing \\nthe National Child Labour Elimination Policy 2010; 5) elimination of child marriages through enforcement \\nof Child Marriage Act 2017 and 6) ensuring children  are removed from abusive and exploitative \\ncircumstances.  \\nImplementation:  Some important legislation was implemented during Seventh Plan  period . One of most \\nimportant ACT was passing of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017. The Act clearly sets the mini mum \\nage for women to marry at 18 and for men at 21 years. However, it also allows for younger brides and \\ngrooms under “special circumstances”. Digital Security Act was enacted in 2018 where it covers any \\ndefamation and instigation against any person, inclu ding children, via the publication or dissemination of \\nany material on a website or in electronic form.  \\nIn addition to these laws, an important development was the consolidation of the Child budget under aegis \\nof Ministry of Finance. Participations of vari ous in the Child Budget have increased during the Seventh \\nPlan. As of FY 2019 -20, as many as 15 ministries are involved in the implementation of the Child budget.  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n767 \\n Figure 14.1 0: Characteristics of the Child -focused Budget in 2019 –20 \\n \\n       Source: Min istry of Finance, Child Budget, 2019 –20. \\nEthnic Communities:  According to the Population Census 2011, more than 1.6 million people of ethnic \\ncommunities live in Bangladesh. About a third of them live in three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts, \\nwhere peo ples from different ethno -linguistic backgrounds form the majority. CHT is the home to 11 \\ndifferent ethnic communities. Other ethnic communities are found in the plain lands, particularly in \\nNorthern Bangladesh. The ethnic communities in Bangladesh are dep rived of economic, social , cultural \\nand political rights . Enforcement of the notion of ‘national unity’, which is not nuanced and sensitive to \\nminority groups, has brought about an elimination of the particular cultural and political values of ethnic \\nminor ities. The result is that ethnic people are socially isolated, with little access to mainstream economic \\nand political spheres. A complex interplay of ethnic inequality, enduring discrimination, lack of education, \\nlittle access to land and lack of employme nt has resulted in increased poverty amongst these groups. One \\nof the major problems for all minority communities is land grabbing by influential people from the \\nmainstream population. Policies to protect the land of ethnic people have not been adequate.  \\nCHT is one of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable regions in the country in terms of almost all major \\ndevelopment indicators, such as income, employment, poverty, health, water, sanitation, education, women \\nemployment, access to infrastructure and nation al building institutions, inter -community confidence, etc. \\nBoth primary school and secondary school completion rates in CHT (i.e. 62.9 % and 15.4% respectively) \\nare significantly lower than the national completion rates (i.e. 98.5 % and 62.2% respectively) . Food \\npoverty is widespread in CHT. The prevalence of absolute poverty and extreme poverty in ethnic \\ncommunities in 2016 is 45.7 per cent  and 28.4 per cent  respectively – almost double of the national poverty \\nrate (24.3%) and extreme poverty rate (12.9%).  Extreme poor ethnic minority people are less able to find \\njobs, making their situation even more perilous. The development challenges facing CHT and government \\nstrategies and responses were discussed in detail in Chapter 7, Part 2 of the Plan Document.  \\nDalit’s and Extreme Poor Groups: Dalit status is historically associated with occupations regarded as \\nritually impure. In Bangladesh, the Dalit’s  are categorized with respect to their work, religion and ethnicity. \\nThere are over 30 different Dalit  groups in Bangladesh, representing 4.5 -5.5 million of the country’s \\n \\n \\nChild Focused \\nBudget (Tk \\n801.97 Billion)  \\n \\n15.33% of the \\nNational \\nBudget  \\n \\n \\n47.58% of the \\n15 Ministries \\nor Divisions\\' \\nBudget  \\n \\n \\n2.78% of \\nGDP \\n \\nTotal 15 \\nMinistries or \\nDivisions\\' Budget \\n(Tk 1685.4) \\nBillion )   \\n \\n768 \\n population. These groups of people, being identified as untouchables, have limited social, economic and \\nemployment opportunities to blend with the mainstream. They are victims of social antagonism d ue to their \\nlow socio -economic status. Historically, the Dalit’s  have been confined to specific jobs and segregated from \\nfull participation with the mainstream society. Dalit communities are some of the most economically \\nmarginalized and socially excluded groups in Bangladesh.  \\nDespite their long presence in the traditional Bangladesh society, Dalit  communities are not focused in \\ndevelopment interventions, and are hence are often referred to as the ‘missing poor’. Economic disparity is \\nnot the only problem f aced by these marginalized groups, but also non -economic problems, some of which \\nare (1) untouchability and the hatred associated with social exclusion, (2) lack of self -esteem and dignity, \\n(3) estrangement from most livelihood activities, (4) forced evict ion from land, (5) insecurity within family \\nand society, (6) ignorance and lack of information, (7) environmental disasters, (8) lack of access to legal \\naid services, (9) lack of access to government services. Social boycott and forced labour are often imp osed \\non Dalit’s  as a means to control and exploit their labour.  \\nSeventh Plan strategies:  The vision of the Seventh was to erase  the discrimination and exploitation faced \\nby Dalit  communities in Bangladesh, so that they can take their place as full citizens  of the country. The \\naims of the Seventh are to include these disadvantaged individuals in the socio -economic realm and protect \\ntheir rights through different strategies. A key strategy will to cooperate with local bodies and NGOs to \\nidentify the disadvant aged people and enable them to participate in development activities. The \\nGovernment will uphold the right to education for children from Dalit  communities with the expectation to \\nensure schools becomes non -discriminatory and inclusive spaces for all child ren. In this regard, a special \\nquota for Dalit  and other excluded students will be created in government schools and colleges, and access \\nof Dalit  adolescents and youth to all government owned skill training institutions will be ensured. Then \\npriority will  be given to the disadvantaged communities in khas land allocation. Tea Garden owners will \\nalso be encouraged to assign some land within the estate to their extreme poor workers as a mean for them \\nto build their own garden. Finally, all government function aries will need to coordinate their activities at \\nall levels to ensure the effective governance of this issue.  \\nImplementation:  The Government remains committed and highly sensitive to the needs of these \\nmarginalized groups. Legal provisions are in place t o protect them against social and political \\ndiscrimination. Yet the weakness in public administrative capacity and the absence of strong local \\ngovernments has limited the implementation of government policies.  The new National Social Security \\n(NSSS) puts considerable emphasis to bring these marginalized groups under the umbrella of social \\nprotection.  The adoption and eventual implementation of the NSSS would be a considerable step forward.  \\n Marginalized Groups : These groups include people living with HIV/ AIDS, female and male sex workers \\nand transgender. All the sexual minority groups face different types of social exclusion which restrict their \\nblending into the mainstream society. Stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS is \\nprevalent  in Bangladesh and inhibits both the physical and mental well -being of those carrying the human \\nimmunodeficiency virus. Stigma also deters the strategies intended to prevent the AIDS epidemic from \\nBangladesh; it may lead to delayed testing, unwillingness t o reveal HIV status to sexual partners and \\nrestricted uptake of prevention programmes.  \\nOf all the types of social exclusion faced by the female sex workers, exclusion regarding their children is \\nthe most threatening one. Children, especially daughters, of sex workers are more prone to becoming sex \\nworkers as well. In a broader perspective, a much bigger problem that is not only faced by the sex workers’   \\n \\n769 \\n children but by other groups as well is that they are discriminated in terms of opportunity to enter the \\nmainstream society. The situation is even worse for transgender people. They face discrimination at every \\nstage of their lives. Up until November 2013 they were not allowed to have voter ID cards, meaning they \\nwere not even considered eligible to have the most basic right as a citizen. However, hijra/transgender has \\nbeen recognized as a third gender in 2013. Many of the sexual minority issues are in conflict with existing \\nlaws, e.g. sodomy is a punishable act under criminal penal code.  \\nThere are additional problems in case of availing social services. Transgender and sex workers are not \\nconsidered for health insurance, while they probably need it more than others. Problems also prevail in case \\nof attaining security and legal services from law enforcement aut horities. Another big barrier for \\ntransgender people is that they are not considered for either formal or informal sector employment. All \\nthese factors contribute to pushing sexual minority groups away from the mainstream and into deeply \\nentrenched margina lization and lack of societal identity.  \\nThe combination of a lack of knowledge, misinterpretation, incorrect information, religious condemnation, \\npunitive laws and practices leads many sexual and gender minority people to experience confusion, a sense \\nof w orthlessness riddled with guilt.  This in turn leads to negative health outcomes such as poor mental \\nhealth, suicide inclination and greater vulnerability owing to lower self -esteem and higher risk taking \\nbehaviour.  \\nPersons with Disabilities: It is estimat ed that approximately 9 per cent  of the total population, including 3 \\nmillion children, are disabled in Bangladesh, of which half a million are multi -handicapped. Around one -\\nthird of all households have a disabled member. Disability on this scale represent s not only a major health \\nissue, but is also a prime cause of poverty and underdevelopment. The children of Bangladesh are the future \\nof the country and children with disabilities are the most vulnerable children. Disability can occur at any \\nstage of life,  varying over the lifecycle and with a significant increase from around age 50. It is alarming \\nthat the total level of disability is increasing with an ageing population.  \\nPersons with disabilities are excluded from microfinance schemes, own less land and a re less likely to be \\ninvolved in any economic activity. The vast majority of them have to leave employment. More than 80 per \\ncent of children with disabilities are not in education. Although persons with disabilities are identified as a \\nparticularly vulner able category of people, their own knowledge and perspectives are conspicuously absent \\nfrom policy formulation and implementation.  \\nBangladesh has come a long way in terms of promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities \\n(PWD). Both the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Beijing Proclamation on \\nthe Full Participation and Equality with Disability in Asia and the Pacific Region have been ratified. A 5 -\\nyear National Disability Action Plan in 2006 was also implemente d, making all relevant ministries \\nresponsible for undertaking various initiatives to include and protect PWD.  \\nHowever, challenges remain in terms of equal opportunities starting from education access to employment \\npossibilities. Poverty is high among pers ons with disabilities (PWD) (Table 14.7).  \\n \\n   \\n \\n770 \\n Table 14.7: Vulnerability and Poverty in Persons with Disabilities (PWD)  \\nCategories  Vulnerability  Poverty  Extreme Poverty  \\nA.

The Government will promote and protecting rights of persons with disabilities to facilitate their \\nfull participation in mainstream social, political and cultural lives. They will be enabled to lead productive \\nand meaningful lives through access to education, health care, food and nutrition, employment and \\nprotectio n and security in society. The Government is strongly committed to the advancement and rights of \\npersons with disabilities by virtue of the Constitution, which enshrines equal rights and status for every \\ncitizen, and by signing the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Beijing \\nProclamation on the Full Participation and Equality with Disability in Asia and the Pacific Region. In order \\nto overcome these issues, a series of strategic actions have been formulated by the 7FYP. These fall u nder \\n4 broad categories: education, health, inclusion and governance.   \\n14.6.2  Implementation  \\nSome good progress was made in implementing the 7FYP strategy for the disable (Table 14.8). \\nNevertheless, there is a substantial unfinished agenda that will requi re further efforts in the 8FYP.  \\nTable 14.8: 7FYP Progress with Social Security Benefits for Persons with Disabilities  \\nActivities  Performance \\nIndicators  Timeframe  Progress  \\nPrepare guidelines for  \\nthe identification of  \\nPWDs  Issue of \\nCircular  July 2017  The gu ideline is in place.

Since 2015, the number of \\nbeneficiaries has more than doubled (from 400 thousand \\nto nearly 1 million).  \\nStrengthen monitoring \\nof schemes for PWDs  Development of \\na monitoring \\nframework  - No monitor ing framework has been developed.  \\nSource: MTIR  of NSSS    \\n \\n771 \\n 14.6.3  Inclusion Strategy for the Eighth Plan  \\nThe Eighth Plan strategy for inclusion is based on implementation of the Constitution that provides equal \\nrights and opportunities to all citizens irrespe ctive of race, religion, caste, creed or profession. It will build \\non the positive lessons of experience of the Seventh Plan while focusing special attention to those areas \\nwhere progress has been more limited.  \\nStrategy for the Children: The vision regard ing children’s advancement and rights is that all children in \\nBangladesh, irrespective of gender and socio -economic background, should be ensured access to essential \\nservices, including social security, health care, nutrition and education, and enjoy prote ction from all forms \\nof violence, abuse and exploitation, to be able to reach their full potential and realize their rights .  \\nThe goals to be achieved are: (i) ensuring children’s rights and advancement through the implementation \\nof government policies and  legislations; (ii) providing health services the children need; (iii) ensuring \\naccess to food and nutrition they need; (iv) providing access to girls to education, training and development \\nopportunities; (v) ensuring access to urban poor children to early  childhood development, education, sports \\nand cultural activities providing knowledge and life skill; (vi) protecting children from all forms of abuse, \\nexploitation and violence; (vii) providing access to children particularly in urban and remote settings to \\nclean water and sanitation, and a healthy environment; (viii) ensuring participation of children in defining \\ntheir needs, developing programmes, implementing interventions, and evaluating their success; (ix) \\nensuring support of duty bearer, parents and other care givers on whom children have to depend; and (x) \\nensuring widespread public support for survival and development of children.  \\nIntervention and actions as indicated below will be taken during the Eighth Plan are continuation some of \\nthe strategie s of the Seventh plan, and also in line with provisions of the National Children Policy 2011.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child health : Caring practices for women and children emerges as a most critical pathway in \\nBangladesh. The programme areas include arrangements for safe child bi rth, eradication of polio, \\nelimination of measles and neonatal tetanus, improvement of nutrition and strengthening the school \\nhealth programme. The actions will include maximizing the efficiency and cost -effectiveness of health \\nexpenditure and improving go vernance. The specific activities will include sensitizing primary and \\nsecondary students about critical child health and reproductive health issues, healthy practices and \\nworm infestation, and supplying iron and folic acid tablets for schoolgirls. Necessa ry measures will be \\ntaken to include such issues in school syllabus. Activities will be undertaken to develop an adolescent \\nhealth strategy including counselling , building awareness for adolescents on hygienic practices, \\nnutrition, puberty, RTI/STD and HIV /AIDS. Regional variations will be taken into consideration for \\nawareness building in using ORT for treating diarrhoea . Minimizing regional disparities in \\nimmunization coverage will be addressed to reduce disparities in vaccination coverage through \\neffecti ve programmatic interventions.  \\n\\uf0b7 Food and nutrition:  Nutrition related programme coverage will be expanded, including a nutrition -\\nsensitive approach of the social security system and priority inclusion of poor households with children \\nin social security prog rammes. Special attention will be given to improve the nutritional status of \\nchildren aged 24 months and below. Provision of nutritional supplement for pregnant and lactating \\nmother will be uncompromisingly implemented. To control vitamin A deficiency and contain the   \\n \\n772 \\n prevalence of night blindness, vitamin A supplements will be distributed to children with vitamin A \\ndeficiency, measles, persistent diarrhoea  or severe malnutrition and to postpartum women within 6 \\nweeks of delivery. On-going  efforts to control  iodine deficiency disorders through universal salt \\niodization will continue. Strategies to control anaemia  will include iron -foliate supplementation, \\nanathematic treatment, fortification and BCC to increase the consumption of iron -rich foods and \\npromoters  of iron absorption. A strategy will be developed to address the health care needs of children \\nwith physical and mental disabilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child education:  The intervention for early childhood development will include an awareness raising \\nprogramme for parents  to make them aware of early childhood development benefits, promote \\ncommunity -based childcare centres for clusters of families where literate mothers are trained to become \\ncaregivers and design facilities for early learners. Pre -primary education (for chi ldren 3 -5 years) will \\nbe expanded to make formal education more effective. Highest level priority will be given to increase \\nenrolment rate and decrease dropout rate, train primary teachers, increase the attendance rate, increase \\ncontact hours, and maintain  gender parity in access and achievement. Vocational and technical \\neducation will be accorded high importance, to create better conditions for future gainful employment. \\nSpecial efforts will be made to reach out street children and the orphans and bring th em in the fold of \\nchild education network.  Non-formal education will be provided to diverse types of children deprived \\nof education, like un -enrolled or drop -out children and hard -to-reach children to enhance their \\nemployability and productivity through s kill training.  \\n\\uf0b7 Access to water and sanitation:  The specific objectives are to mitigate arsenic problem in drinking \\nwater by providing alternative systems, increase rural and urban slum access to sanitary latrines, expand \\nwater and sanitation services to co ver currently underserved Pourashava areas, provide improved water \\nsupply to underserved, un -served and difficult to reach areas. Primary schools will be ensured access \\nto sanitation and safe drinking water.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child empowerment:  Children will be empowered t o have a voice in the socio - economic decision -\\nmaking process at family, society and national levels. In this respect, it would be necessary to create a \\nnational platform for allowing children to express opinions on their needs and expectations and means \\nof addressing them.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child protection:  Measures will be taken to ensure right to protection from all forms of abuse, \\nexploitation and violence for all children, particularly those who are vulnerable  such as street children \\nand orphans . The policies of exist ing NPA will be used against sexual abuse and exploitation of children \\nand trafficking. Laws affecting children will be harmonized and enforced. Awareness amongst law \\nenforcing officials and judicial officers and the development of a diversion scheme invol ving the courts, \\nsocial workers and probation officers as an alternative to custodial sentences will be undertaken. A \\nwidespread social awareness campaign and community mobilization on protection issues will be \\nundertaken to foster positive attitudes towar ds children, particularly girls, and bolster the positive \\nattitude of parents and decision -makers on the need to protect children regardless of the socio -economic \\nenvironment.    \\n \\n773 \\n \\uf0b7 Birth registration and child marriage:  The Municipal Corporations and Pourashava s will be \\nmobilized to register all births. Awareness raising programmes through union Parishad members, and \\nleaders of social opinion including Imams will be conducted to eliminate the practice of early marriage.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child labour:   Effective measures will be  taken to reduce child labour, and eliminate worst forms of \\nchild labour with a particular focus on child domestic workers, migrants, refugees and other vulnerable \\ngroups. In this context, a policy for children in the formal sector focusing on those caught  up in the \\nworst forms of child labour will be formulated. Street children will be assisted in accessing their rights \\nand protecting them from all forms of abuse and exploitation. Coordination between government \\nagencies, NGOs working on child issues, pare nts and community people will be required for an \\neffective rehabilitation and development of street children. Working children such as waste collectors, \\nleather workers, brick breakers, auto -workshop workers and tempo helpers will have access to learning \\nopportunities in formal and non -formal facilities. Extreme poor households, where the occurrence of \\nchild labour is highest, will be covered by livelihoods interventions for adult earners.  \\n\\uf0b7 Child abuse:  To recover and remove children from abusive and exploit ative circumstances, \\ninterventions will include developing community support for these children, providing livelihood \\nalternatives, basic services and adoption, and implementing policies and legislation necessary for the \\nprevention of abuse, discrimination , exploitation and violence. Steps will be taken to increase efficiency \\nto combat sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking of children through enhanced coordination and \\ncooperation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Management and coordination: The Ministry of Women and Children Affairs  will conduct public \\nadvocacy and coordinate interventions for children’s well -being and rights. An inter -ministerial \\ncoordination committee consisting of government ministries with children’s portfolios and \\norganizations representing children’s mandate wi ll be chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of \\nWomen and Children Affairs and will coordinate implementation of the Children Act 2013, CRC, \\nCEDAW, and the World Fit for Children Plan of Action.  \\nStrategy for Ethnic Population : The government is committed  to ensuring socio -economic and political \\nrights, fundamental human rights, and social security, while enabling ethnic people to retain their social, \\ncultural, and traditional identities. The ethnic communities of the CHT will be ensured access to educatio n, \\nhealth care, food and nutrition, employment, and overseas employment, and protection of rights to land and \\nother resources. Alternative farm and non -farm -based livelihoods  will be ensured for them . They will be \\nprotected from hazards caused by climate c hange and other natural calamities. Additional finance will be \\nallocated as a priority for the implementation of projects that contribute to the development of the people \\nof the CHT and to bridging the development gap between the hills and the plains. A Pe rspective Plan will \\nbe formulated for the development of the CHT through a consultation process with key stakeholders. \\nSpecial measures will be taken to preserve the characteristics of the CHT and the cultural identity of the \\nethnic groups. Like CHT Land D ispute Resolution Commission, the government will take measures to \\nestablish a separate land commission for ethnic minorities in the plain land.   \\nStrategic Goal and Policy Direction: Recognizing the special socio -cultural and geographic situation of \\nthe CH T, the following strategic goals and policy direction will be pursued:    \\n \\n774 \\n The government is committed to ensuring socio -economic and political rights, fundamental human rights, \\nand social security, while enabling tribal people to retain their social, cultura l and traditional identities. The \\nethnic communities of the CHT will be insured access to education, health care, food and nutrition, \\nemployment, and overseas employment, and protection of rights to land and other resources. They will be \\nensured alternativ e farm and non -farm -based livelihoods. They will be protected from hazards caused by \\nclimate change and other natural calamities.  Additional finance will be allocated as a priority for the \\nimplementation of projects that contribute to the development of t he people of the CHT and to bridging the \\ndevelopment gap between the hills and the plains.  \\nAreas of Future Action : The CHT has specific needs, requirements, and capabilities, and thus requires \\ndifferentiated measures and approaches, and delivery mechanisms  that are appropriate to the local cultural \\nand social context.  \\n\\uf0b7 UN Declaration : The Government will consider implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights \\nof Indigenous Peoples 2007 and ratifying the ILO Convention 169.  \\n\\uf0b7 CHT Peace Accord : The government w ill ensure full implementation of the CHT treaty signed in \\n1997. The CHT Accord Implementation  and Monitoring Committee and the Task Force on Tribal \\nRefugee Returnees and the Internally Displaced Persons will be strengthened and activated for \\nimplementatio n of the related issues of the CHT Peace Accord. The Ministry of CHT Affairs, CHT \\nRegional Council, and three Hill District Councils in will be strengthened as per the concerned \\nlegislations to support the development of the CHT. As per the provisions of t he CHT Peace \\nAccord, the remaining offices and institutions of concerned functions will  be transferred to HDCs \\nin terms of administration, finance, and development fund in letter and spirit and with allocation of \\nfinance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Land rights : The Land Commission w ill resolve the land disputes in CHT following the amended \\nLand Commission Dispute Resolution Act 2001 to ensure the rights to land. Rules of the CHT Land \\nDisputes Resolutions will be enacted soon  so that CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission can \\nfunctio n Community  ownership of land in the CHT will be honoured. A land survey will be carried \\nout in consultation with the key stakeholders as per the provisions of the CHT Peace Accord. An \\nappropriate land policy will be formulated which can deal with land dis putes involving ethnic \\ngroups. A secure land tenure system will be introduced.  \\n\\uf0b7 Empowering ethnic communities : The Government will ensure participation of local people in \\ndevelopment activities and management of natural resources and will recognize the trad itional \\ncustoms and knowledge of the various ethnic peoples. The Government will ensure community \\ninvolvement in the adoption of technologies in line with the traditional food production system. \\nThe Government will provide appropriate training and support to people for development of their \\nvocational skills and knowledge.  \\n\\uf0b7 Access to education, language, and culture : A national language policy will be formulated to \\nsafeguard the languages of ethnic peoples. Effective initiatives must be taken to incorporate \\nchildren from small groups into mainstream education programmes. Besides the allocation from \\nthe Prime Minister’s Office for sector -based education and scholarships will have to be increased. \\nMoreover, a national language policy needs to formulate to safeg uard the languages of ethnic \\npeoples. Regular supervision and monitoring, especially for quality primary education, will be   \\n \\n775 \\n strengthened. The government needs to ensure establishment of residential primary and secondary \\nschools for children of extremely po or parents in remote and inaccessible area of the CHT. The \\nGovernment will take action to expand multilingual education for tribal students at primary school \\nlevel. The Government will take measures to preserve and promote the culture and heritage of \\nethni c communities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Creating Income Generating Activities:  Income generating activities through small and cottage \\nindustries, trading, poultry and livestock rearing, beekeeping, mushroom cultivation, and others \\nwill be expanded. The income of poor people will b e enhanced through social forestry in hill areas, \\ncultivation of fruits and medicinal plants, and expanding non -farm employment opportunities. \\nEqual emphasis will be given to the farm and non -farm sectors including internal and external \\nlabour mobility to expand employment opportunities for the youth.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting Marketing Infrastructure:  Proper market infrastructure and rural road and market \\nfacilities will be developed so that farmers/producers can achieve a better price from selling their \\nproducts. Measure s will be taken to eliminate barriers so that agricultural and other local products \\nhave easy access to national and international markets. A special programme will be developed to \\nstrengthen postharvest management, value chain development, processing, pac kaging, and market \\naccess, and to engage private sector market linkages. Private investment in processing, packaging, \\nand marketing CHT products and services will be encouraged.  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhancing Human Development:  Existing human resource development programmes wi ll be \\naugmented to address the special needs of ethnic people and strengthen their vocational and social \\nskills. Necessary training and support will be provided to the youth. Monitoring and supervision \\nwill be strengthened so that education, health and mat ernal child health services, social safety nets, \\nand nutrition and housing facilities reach the ethnic people. Special arrangements targeting ethnic \\ncommunities to prepare them to take up the opportunities provided by national and global labour \\nmarkets, in cluding overseas employment, and thus enable them to increase their income. \\nAppropriate skill development training and support will be delivered to the youth of CHT, to \\nprovide vocational and social skills.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promoting Eco -Tourism:  Following the Peace Accord  and the subsequent legislations, Tourism, \\nespecially ecotourism and community -based tourism will be encouraged as a means of income \\ngeneration for the local people. Private local investment will be encouraged to develop sustainable \\ntourist spots and facil ities in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari by engaging tribal people. \\nCare and caution will be taken so that tourism does not adversely affect the local culture and \\nenvironment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring Energy:  Supply of electricity through the national grid in differe nt upazilas of the \\nChittagong Hill Tracts should be increased. In the remote areas of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where \\nelectricity is not possible to be accessed through the national grid, it will be necessary to cover the \\nelectricity through installation  of solar panels in all areas. Necessary steps must be taken to ensure a \\nmodern standard of living by expanding the network of mobile phones and reducing the cost of internet.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expanding Credit Facilities:  Measures should be taken for the expansion of micro  credit \\ndistribution activities and technical training among the poor. Necessary steps should be taken to \\ndevelop rural roads and establish market linkage for locally produced agricultural products. \\nBesides, uninterrupted power supply must be ensured for t he development of small and medium \\nindustries.    \\n \\n776 \\n \\uf0b7 Promoting Sustainable Development:  Village/mouza community forest will be created and \\nexpanded in the CHT to conserve biodiversity and the watersheds and ensure that people have \\naccess to water. Efforts will b e undertaken involving the local communities for afforestation over \\nthe region. Measures will be taken to protect wildlife and biodiversity. Special initiatives will be \\nundertaken to ensure the flow of water in creeks, water bodies and waterfalls by preser ving the \\nnatural sources and integrated watershed management.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mitigating Climate Related Challenges:  Consideration the effect of climate change and \\nlandslides in CHT and necessary measures to adapt and mitigate climate change related hazards. \\nInnovative an d sustainable adaptation strategies and methods will be ensured to protect people and \\nthe environment from hazards caused by climate change.  \\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening Implementation Capacity:  Election and management of the Hill Districts \\nCouncils following the Hill Di strict Council Act, 1989  will be ensured . Capacity development of \\nthe Ministry, CHTRC, CHTDB and HDCs will be enhanced by increasing manpower and other \\nfacilities. Technology  will be used  to construct roads, dams, bridges, culverts, infrastructure for \\nmitigating earthquakes, landslides related hazards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Developing a Perspective Plan for CHT : The Government will formulate a Perspective Plan for \\nthe development of CHT through a consultation process with key stakeholders. The basis of \\ndevelopment planning and p rogrammes in the CHT will be the CHT Peace Accord  and the \\nsubsequent legislations i.e. HDCs Acts, CHTRC Act and allocation of Business of MoCHTA .  \\n\\uf0b7 Accelerated development of CHT : Additional finance will be allocated on priority basis for \\nimplementation of programmes/projects to reduce poverty and to attain middle income status by \\n2021. All funds of line Ministries for CHT development will be channelled through the Ministry \\nof CHT Affairs. Representatives of the ethnic groups will be included in development projects \\nundertaken in their areas.  \\nStrategy for Dalits and Extreme Poor Groups: The vision of the Government is to erase  the discrimination \\nand exploitation faced by Dalit  communities in Bangladesh, so that they can take their place as full citizens \\nof the country.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will uphold the right to education for children from Dalit  communities with the \\nexpectation to ensure schools becomes non -discriminatory and inclusive spaces for all children. This \\nrecognizes  the increased interest and conviction  among the marginalized that education holds the key \\nfor socioeconomic mobility. In this regard, a special quota for Dalit  and other excluded students will \\nbe created in government schools and colleges, and access of Dalit  adolescents and youth to all \\ngove rnment owned skill training institutions will be ensured.  \\n\\uf0b7 Local Government Institutions, i.e. Upazila and Union Parishads, along with NGOs will be involved to \\nlocate disadvantaged Dalit  people and help enable them to participate in development activities. Dalit \\nrepresentation in all committees of political parties at national and local level will be ensured.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry of Land will give priority to allotting khas land to people of Dalit  communities for \\nsettlement under the Asrayan type housing project. Fo r tea garden workers, planters/owners will be \\nencouraged to earmark land within the estates so that they can build their own dwelling. Special \\nprogrammes like construction of sweeper colonies will be implemented.    \\n \\n777 \\n \\uf0b7 Massive awareness raising to stop all kind s of discrimination and untouchability against Dalits  and \\nexcluded communities will be undertaken.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will form a special commission on Dalits  to evaluate current environment and level \\nof discrimination and provide key recommendations on improv ing the socio -economic conditions of \\nDalit  communities in Bangladesh.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will review the allotment policy of colonies under every City Corporation and \\nmunicipality and ensure that marginalized groups of Dalits  are allotted harassment free acce ss to \\nelectricity, gas and water supply services.  \\n\\uf0b7 Dalits will be given preferential access to cleaning jobs in municipalities, including lease of public \\ntoilets of City Corporations to Dalit  sweepers.  \\n\\uf0b7 Proper resettlement will be provided for evicted Dalit  families.  \\n\\uf0b7 Dalit households will be given preferential access to social security programmes. Such affirmative \\naction will be combined with capability enhancement and confidence building, to empower these \\ngroups to have a voice and make claims, and an effect ive grievance mechanism.  \\n\\uf0b7 Massive public education against discrimination and towards equity -inclusion will be promoted, \\nbuilding greater transparency through social audits and public hearings.  \\nStrategy for Marginalized Groups: The vision is a society where  sexual minority groups can live with \\nrespect and dignity and enjoy tolerance and social justice. This includes an HIV/AIDS free society with \\nzero new infections, zero discrimination and zero deaths.  \\n\\uf0b7 People infected and affected by HIV/AIDS will be given u niversal access to treatment, care and support \\nservices. This will include increased coverage of HIV testing and counselling . There will be increased \\ncoverage on interventions (basic educational, counselling , referral and legal supportive services) for \\nkey populations including people living with HIV, along with implementation of services to prevent \\nnew HIV infections. This will include opiate substitution therapy for people who inject drugs. The \\nGovernment will inform about the availability of effective tr eatment for adequate and timely \\nantiretroviral treatment, since unawareness may discourage people from getting tested.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ignorance fuels stigma and discrimination and raising awareness and knowledge of the general public \\nwill be given the highest priority, t o address stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV, sex \\nworkers and transgender people in Bangladesh. To promote the rights of the sexual and discriminated \\ngroups and also to provide access to healthcare and HIV services, the Government will, in  partnership \\nwith civil society organisations, undertake mass awareness campaigns and population specific \\nawareness and education campaigns on HIV and AIDS.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will work together with NGOs as they are often in a better position than the public  \\nsector to expand the outreach of the service to reach more close to the clients, particularly to reach high -\\nrisk groups, such as sex workers and injecting drug users. The Government will build the capacity of \\nNGOs, especially the small ones, and combine t heir reach with the resources and strategic programmes \\nof the Government as an effective way to change behaviour in high -risk groups and prevent the spread \\nof HIV virus to the general public.    \\n \\n778 \\n \\uf0b7 The Government will, in conjecture with NGOs and the private sec tor, introduce provisions for skill \\nbuilding of sex workers and transgender who prefer to opt out of sex work and build their lives around \\nsafer occupations in the form of either small entrepreneurship or small cooperative societies.   \\n\\uf0b7 Sexual minority grou ps will be integrated in the national social protection mechanisms including access \\nto social health insurance or other transfers to ensure realization of human rights and fundamental \\nfreedom of those socially excluded that are most vulnerable.  \\n\\uf0b7 Coordinatio n mechanisms and management capacity at different levels will be strengthened to ensure \\nan effective multi -sector HIV/AIDS response. Also, strategic information systems and research for an \\nevidence -based response will be strengthened.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Government will m ake laws and policies that facilitate the HIV response and work with uniformed \\nservices and health care workers to increase knowledge and tolerance.  \\nStrategy for the PWDs :  Persons with disabilities will be brought into the mainstream of the development \\nprocess. The Government will promote and protecting rights of persons with disabilities to facilitate their \\nfull participation in mainstream social, political and cultural lives. They will be enabled to lead productive \\nand meaningful lives through access to  education, health care, food and nutrition, employment and \\nprotection and security in society. The Government is strongly committed to the advancement and rights of \\npersons with disabilities by virtue of the Constitution, which enshrines equal rights and status for every \\ncitizen, and by signing the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Beijing \\nProclamation on the Full Participation and Equality with Disability in Asia and the Pacific Region.  \\nThe proposed actions for the Eighth Plan include:  \\nThe Rights  and Protection  of the Persons with Disabilities  Act, 2013  (RPPD) will be implemented to ensure \\ninternational standards on disability rights as set out in the Act. The National Coordination Committee for \\nPersons with Disabilities will be  strengthened to monitor and coordinate activities of different \\nministries/divisions in implementation of the Act. Requirements of the poor and vulnerable, including \\nwomen and children, will be prioritized in all activities and implemented.  \\nThe Government will ensure full implementation of the Disability Benefit schemes proposed in NSSS \\nduring the Eighth Plan. The Government will ensure that every child certified as having a severe disability \\nwill be provided with a regular transfer, known as the Child Disa bility Benefit. This will extend the current \\nChild Disability Grant that is managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare. The Government will develop a \\nmechanism to identify severe disability among children, which will not only include children with physical \\ndisability but also other disabilities like autism, cognitive, mental, sensory impairment, etc. It is estimated \\nthat there will be around 350,000 children eligible for the scheme. Mechanisms will also be established to \\nremove children with disabilities fro m the street, making the Child Disability Benefit conditional on \\nchildren not involved in begging. A system of penalties will be introduced for those who employ children \\nas beggars.  \\nThe current disability grant managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare wi ll be reformed into a scheme that \\nprovides a regular transfer to all poor and vulnerable citizens of Bangladesh with a severe disability. The \\nscheme will be accessible by all poor and vulnerable people aged 19 -59 years with a severe disability and, \\nat 60 y ears, they will transition to the Citizens’ Pension. The Government will design robust measures for   \\n \\n779 \\n identifying severe disability and will establish an appeals mechanism for those who feel that they have been \\nunfairly excluded.  \\nThe introduction of a reform ed Disability Benefit will mark a significant change in the lives of the disabled \\ncitizens who are poor. They will be better able to enter the labour market and access credit so that they can \\ninvest in small businesses. The Ministry of Social Welfare will complement the Disability Benefit by \\nproviding additional support to recipients by ensuring access to vocational education and small business \\nschemes and eliminating discrimination in the labour market.  \\nAlong with an expansion of integrated education progr amme for visually impaired children, existing \\ninstitutions for hearing impaired and mentally retarded children will be expanded. New institutions will be \\nestablished to provide access to more children with disabilities at primary, secondary and tertiary le vels. A \\ncollaborative effort involving the government, NGOs and the private sector will be encouraged to expedite \\nan expansion of existing institutions, establish new institutions and undertake teachers’ training on \\ndisability.  \\nAction will be taken in the  health sector to: (i) strengthen early detection of symptoms of disability and \\nprovide primary medical rehabilitation; (ii) undertake a nutrition programme for pregnant women; (iii) \\nappoint trainee doctors, nurses and other caregivers to deal with disabil ity issues; and (iv) introduce support \\nservices of assistive devices and equipment at health centres.  \\nMeasures will be taken so that persons with disabilities can have access to all physical facilities and \\ninformation and communication. Inclusion of perso ns with disabilities in various national and community \\nlevel decision making processes that affect their lives will be ensured. Services like early detection and \\ntimely medical intervention, fitment of artificial aids and appliances, educational services i n special and \\nintegrated schools, vocational rehabilitation including micro -credit will be provided to persons with \\ndisabilities through community based rehabilitation programmes.  \\nAs persons with disabilities are predominantly poor and marginalised in soci ety, it is necessary to support \\nthe organising of people with disabilities in order to make them ‘visible’ and to empower them to make \\ntheir voices heard. Some persons with disabilities require specialised support services, assistive devices and \\njob modifi cations but, more importantly, the right to decent work needs to be recognised. Such approach \\ncan ensure meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the development process.  \\n14.7 8FYP DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION SOCIAL \\nWELFARE AND SOCIAL INCLUSION  \\nPoverty reduction, income inequality, women  empowerment, social inclusion and social protection are all \\ncross -cutting themes and involve a range of Ministries in delivering related activities. Total resources \\nrequired for implementing the underlying strategies are also not easy to identify due to the cross -cutting \\nand over -arching nature of these themes. For example, poverty reduction entails the successful \\nimplementation of the government’s growth strategy as well as the entire public inv estment programme. \\nSimilarly, since much of the job creation is one by the private sector, private investment is a critical \\ndeterminant of poverty reduction as well.     \\n \\n780 \\n In the case of social protection, the Government provides a separate allocation, mostly from the current \\nbudget, that has amounted to about 1.2% of GDP during the Seventh Plan excluding civil service pensions \\nthat is not poverty focused. For the Eighth Plan, the top most priority is to implement the NSSS. Thus, the \\nEighth Plan also projects t o increase the average poverty -focused  spending on social protection from 1.2% \\nof GDP to 2.0 % during the Eighth Plan.  \\nAgainst the backdrop of the above, there are some specialized line Ministries that oversee and provide \\nspecific services to support women  empowerment, social inclusion and social protection. These are: The \\nMinistry of Social welfare; the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs; the Ministry of Food, the Ministry \\nof Disaster Management  and relief , and the Ministry of Liberation Affairs. The p roposed ADP allocations \\nfor these are shown in Tables 14.9 and 14.10. It should be noted that for most of the programmes  they \\nadminister involving income transfers to the poor and vulnerable are financed from the current budget.  So, \\nthe total funding the y have at their disposal is much larger than indicated by ADP allocations.  \\nTable 14.9: Eighth Plan ADP Allocations for Social Protection  \\n(Taka billion current prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Social Welfare  2.7 3.4 3.9 4.5 5.4 \\nMinistry of Women and Children Affairs  4.1 5.1 5.9 6.8 8.2 \\nMinistry of Food  6.1 7.5 8.7 10.1 12.2 \\nMinistry of Disaster Management and Relief  56.2 64.6 69.1 80.7 89.4 \\nMinistry of Liberation Affairs  3.3 4.0 4.6 5.4 6.5 \\nSector Total  89.2 84.6 92.2 107.6 121.7  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Annex Table A5.1  \\nTable 14.10: Eighth Plan ADP Allocations for Social Protection  \\n(Taka billion FY2021 constant prices)  \\nMinistry  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  FY2024  FY2025  \\nMinistry of Social Welfare  2.7 3.2 3.5 3.9 4.5 \\nMinistry of Women and Children Affairs  4.1 4.8 5.3 5.9 6.7 \\nMinistry of Food  6.1 7.2 7.8 8.7 10.0 \\nMinistry of Disaster Management and Relief  56.2 61.3 62.5 69.5 73.5 \\nMinistry of Liberation Affairs  3.3 3.8 4.2 4.7 5.3 \\nSector Total  89.2 80.3 83.3 92.6 100.0  \\nSource: Chapter 5, Annex Table A5.2 s'"
